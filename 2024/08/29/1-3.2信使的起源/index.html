<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on August 1, 2012 in Boulder, CO<br>2012年8月1日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People have no idea what it means to be a Messenger or how Messengers are selected or prepared. They want to worship heroes or deny them altogether.</p>
<p>人们不知道信使意味着什么，也不知道信使是如何选拔或准备的。他们想崇拜英雄，或者完全否认英雄。</p>
<p>They want to believe the Messenger is the Message, but the Message is always greater than the Messenger. People will base their whole view and approach on their attitude towards the Messenger, but the Message is always more important.</p>
<p>他们想要相信信使就是讯息，但讯息总是比信使更伟大。人们会根据自己对信使的态度来决定自己的整个观点和做法，但讯息总是更加重要。</p>
<p>People cannot live with the Message, so they obsess over the Messenger. But they do not understand the Messenger. They have no idea where the Messenger comes from and how the Messenger is selected above and beyond everyone else. Many people think there cannot be one Messenger. There must be many Messengers, or they themselves should be a Messenger.</p>
<p>人们无法与讯息共存，所以他们迷恋信使。但他们并不理解信使。他们不知道信使从何而来，也不知道信使是如何被挑选出来，超越其他人的。很多人认为信使不可能只有一位。必须有许多信使，或者他们自己也应该是信使。</p>
<p>Into a world of Separation, one representing a greater union will be misconstrued and misperceived. It cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>在一个分离的世界里，一个代表着更大结合的世界会被曲解和误解。这是无法避免的。</p>
<p>The Angelic Host, the Angelic Assembly, selects the Messenger for every particular world where a Messenger is required. And a Messenger is only selected at times of great change, difficulty and opportunity for a race, for a given world. Such great turning points only come very infrequently.</p>
<p>天使群体（天使圣团）为每个需要信使的特定世界挑选信使。信使只在一个种族、一个特定世界发生重大变化、遇到重大困难和伟大机会的时候才会被选中。这种伟大的转折点很少出现。</p>
<p>Despite the great events that are occurring in your world at any given time, Messengers will only come very infrequently. In the interim, there will be prophets—giving warnings or setting standards for behavior. There will be visionaries. There will be reformers. There will be advocates.</p>
<p>尽管在你们的世界中随时都在发生重大事件，但信使的到来将极为罕见。在此期间，会有先知——发出警告或设立行为规范。会有预言者，会有改革者，会有倡导者。</p>
<p>But the Messenger brings a whole new reality. This individual is not simply one who gives warning of the great hazards of the future or the present day, or provides higher standards or a greater vision of peace, cooperation and equanimity amongst the human family, for there are many who can do this. But only a Messenger from God can bring an entire new reality and change over time the awareness and the consciousness of large numbers of people, even affecting the attitudes of the entire human race.</p>
<p>但信使带来了全新的现实。这个人不仅仅是对未来或当今的巨大危险发出警告的人，也不仅仅是为人类大家庭的和平、合作与和谐提供更高标准或更远大理想的人，因为有很多人都能做到这一点。但是，只有上帝的信使才能带来全新的现实，并随着时间的推移改变大量人的觉知和意识，甚至影响整个人类的态度。</p>
<p>A prophet cannot do this, for prophets speak of what is occurring now or in the near future. Their prophecies are not for all time and all peoples. They are specific to certain peoples and places and events.</p>
<p>先知做不到这一点，因为先知说的是现在或不久的将来发生的事情。他们的预言不是针对所有时间和所有民族的。它们是针对某些民族、地点和事件的。</p>
<p>Those who teach a higher standard, they must reinforce a standard that has already been given, many times over, by others who were called to such a valuable service.</p>
<p>那些教导更高标准的人，他们必须强化一个标准，而这个标准已经被其他召唤从事这种有价值服务的人给予了无数次。</p>
<p>But the Messenger brings a whole new reality. They are not charged with meeting every need of the day or resolving every problem or crisis of the hour. They are bringing something to change the whole approach and future of humanity.</p>
<p>但信使带来了全新的现实。他们的任务不是满足当下的每一个需求，也不是解决当下的每一个问题或危机。他们带来的启示旨在改变人类整体的方向和未来。</p>
<p>Messengers are condemned and crucified and destroyed because people do not get what they want from the Messenger. They do not get wealth or greater security or advantages or special favors—endowments from God.</p>
<p>信使之所以被谴责、钉死和毁灭，是因为人们没有从信使那里得到他们想要的东西。他们没有从上帝那里得到财富、更大的安全感、优势或特殊的恩惠。</p>
<p>The Messenger points to the present and to the future and brings a new reality into the world. People who are needy and ambitious do not get what they want in the moment from this, and so they turn away from the Messenger. They deny the Messenger. They condemn the Messenger. They are looking for someone who is going to benefit them right now in the ways that they want and prescribe. They have no idea what they are looking at. They have no idea what they are judging. They have no idea what their greater needs really are—the need of their soul.</p>
<p>信使指向现在和未来，为世界带来新的现实。有需求、有野心的人无法从中得到他们当下想要的东西，因此他们远离信使。他们否认信使。他们谴责信使。他们在寻找一个能够按照他们的意愿和规定为他们带来好处的人。他们不知道自己在看什么。他们不知道自己在评判什么。他们不知道自己更大的需求——灵魂的需求——到底是什么。</p>
<p>This is a dilemma for all peoples in the world—rich or poor, from any nation or culture or religious affiliation. They are not yet aware of the great need of the soul. Those few who are, are reaching within their traditions or beyond their traditions. They are reaching to find this connection inside, this connection with God, and this connection with their future and their destiny and their purpose for being in the world. Everyone else is like cattle grazing in the field, only content to have feed for the day and more pleasures for tomorrow and to be protected, either legitimately or illegitimately, from the hazards of the world.</p>
<p>这是世界上所有人的困境——无论贫富，无论来自哪个国家、文化或宗教信仰。他们尚未察觉灵魂的伟大需求。少数意识到这一点的人，正在他们的传统之内或之外进行探索。他们在寻找内心的联系，寻找与上帝的联系，寻找与自己的未来、天命和存在于这个世界上的目的的联系。其他人就像在田野里吃草的牛，只满足于今天的饲料和明天更多的享乐，并得到合法或非法的保护，免受世界的危害。</p>
<p>God speaks to those who have and those who have not. God speaks to those who rule and those who are ruled. God speaks to those who are honest and those who are dishonest. God speaks to those who are rich and those who are very poor.</p>
<p>上帝对拥有和不拥有的人说话。上帝对统治者和被统治者说话。上帝对诚实的人说话，也对不诚实的人说话。上帝对富人和穷人说话。</p>
<p>The Messenger brings a Message for them all. He is not a reformer. He is not just an advocate. He is not just a visionary. He is not just a prophet warning of the consequences of hazards in the world today. He brings a reality for everyone who can receive him, in humility and honesty. And his presence in the world will cast in contrast everything else that is deceptive and manipulative and self-serving and grievous and unforgiving and angry.</p>
<p>信使为所有人带来了一个讯息。他不是一个改革者，不只是一个倡导者，不只是一个预言者，也不仅仅是一个警告当今世界危险后果的先知。他为每一个能以谦逊和诚实接纳他的人带来了一个全新的现实。他在这个世界上的存在将与其他一切欺骗、操纵、自私、怨恨、无情和愤怒的事物形成鲜明对比。</p>
<p>But the Messenger is not perfect, for none of the great Messengers have been perfect. And the Messenger is not a god, for none of the great Messengers have been gods.</p>
<p>但信使并不完美，因为伟大的信使没有一个是完美的。信使不是上帝，因为伟大的信使都不是上帝。</p>
<p>His origin is from beyond the world. He was selected and prepared by the Angelic Presence to enter into the world at a certain place and a certain time.</p>
<p>他的起源来自世界之外。他被天使的存在选中并做好准备，在特定的地点和特定的时间进入这个世界。</p>
<p>His destiny was to become basically educated about humanity and the human condition and to be insulated from the world sufficiently that his greater promise and calling could occur later in his life when he reached a point of maturity.</p>
<p>他的天命是接收有关人类和人类状况的基本教育，并与世界保持足够的隔绝，以便在他生命的晚期，当他达到成熟的程度时，能够得到更伟大的承诺和召唤。</p>
<p>His life was planned out, you see, unlike everyone around him. His life was really planned out and watched over. This is the reality of all the Messengers. And it is the reality of the Messenger who is in the world today, bringing a New Revelation from God.</p>
<p>他的生命是有计划的，你看，他和周围的人都不一样。他的人生真的是被规划好的，被关注着的。这是所有信使的真实写照。这也是当今世界上的信使的真实写照，他带来了上帝的新启示。</p>
<p>For God has spoken again to prepare humanity for the hazards of living in a diminishing and declining world and the great and unseen dangers of contact with invasive forces from the universe, who are here to take advantage of human weakness, ambition and disunity.</p>
<p>因为上帝再次讲话，让人类做好准备，应对生活在一个日益缩小和衰落的世界中的危险，以及与来自宇宙的入侵力量接触所带来的巨大而看不见的危险，这些入侵力量就是来利用人类的弱点、野心和不团结的。</p>
<p>The Messenger was given the Message beyond the world, not intellectually, but imbued at a deeper level of the mind, beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. Who can understand this? Who in the world today can understand this, but a very few?</p>
<p>信使得到的讯息是超越世界的，不是智力上的，而是浸透在心灵更深层面的，超越了智力的领域和范围。谁能理解这一点？当今世界，除了极少数人，谁能理解这一点？</p>
<p>He would be a humble man. He would be educated, but not highly educated. He would be influenced by the world, but not highly influenced by the world. He would be observant of others, but not captivated by others. He would have to remain available, open and receptive through all the formative years of his life.</p>
<p>他将是一位谦逊的人。他受过教育，但学历不高。他会受到世界的影响，但不会被世界影响得太深。他会观察他人，但不会被他们迷惑。他必须在人生的所有成长岁月中保持开放、坦诚和乐于接受的态度。</p>
<p>Very difficult to achieve, this is, without Divine oversight. Held back from great careers. Held back from committing in relationships until he met his true partner. Held back from interests and hobbies. Held back from becoming an advocate or a reformer. Held back for years and years, failing the standards of society, failing the expectations of society, failing the expectations of family—waiting, preparing for the moment of Initiation.</p>
<p>如果没有神圣的监督，这一点很难实现。在伟大的事业上止步不前。在遇到真实的伴侣之前，在感情上裹足不前。远离兴趣和爱好。无法成为倡导者或改革者。长年累月地退缩，辜负了社会的标准，辜负了社会的期望，辜负了家庭的期望，等待着、准备着入门的那一刻。</p>
<p>For God’s Messenger this time, it happened at the age of 33. He would have to wait a long time. The Message was within him, but beyond his awareness. He was carrying it like a secret cargo. For the cargo must be secret so it cannot be tampered with. It cannot be revealed prematurely. It cannot be misused, misallocated and misunderstood. It must wait for the Initiation, the Great Rays of Initiation, which would strike him so forcibly that it would shatter his life and send him in a new direction entirely.</p>
<p>对于上帝这次的信使来说，它发生在33岁。他需要等待很长时间。讯息与他同在，却超越了他的觉知。他像携带秘密货物一样携带着它。因为货物必须是秘密的，不能被篡改。不能过早透露。它不能被滥用、错误分配和误解。它必须等待启蒙（入门）的时刻，等待伟大的启蒙之光，这光会如此强烈地冲击他，以至于打碎他的生活，并将他完全引向新的方向。</p>
<p>People think that the great Messengers are all very saintly, very pure, never having made an error in life. This is foolishness. Of course they all made errors in life. Some of them have suffered greatly for it.</p>
<p>人们认为伟大的信使都非常圣洁、非常纯净，一生从未犯过错误。这是愚蠢的。他们当然都犯过错误。他们中的一些人为此遭受了巨大的痛苦。</p>
<p>What made them Messengers was the power of the Message imbued in them and their ability to withstand the seductions, the tragedies and the pressures of the world to such a time where their Initiation could begin. And this could not have happened without Divine oversight and careful management of their lives. People think this oversight is available to everyone, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>他们之所以能成为信使，是因为他们身上所蕴含的讯息的力量，以及他们经受住诱惑、悲剧和世俗压力的能力，从而使他们的入门得以开始。如果没有神圣的监督和对他们生命的精心管理，这一切是不可能发生的。人们认为每个人都能得到这种监督，但事实并非如此。</p>
<p>In all cases, the Messengers did not know who they were or what they were carrying or what it would mean for the future until the point of Initiation and the process of Initiation that would ensue that would carry them forward through many thresholds into the future. Time and place were very important here, and the degree of support they received from certain individuals was very important here.</p>
<p>在所有情况下，信使们都不知道自己是谁，也不知道自己背负着什么，更不知道这对未来意味着什么，直到入门的那一刻和随之而来的启蒙过程将带着他们穿过许多门槛，走向未来。时间和地点在这里非常重要，他们从某些人那里得到的支持程度在这里也非常重要。</p>
<p>This is truly a unique individual in the world, and always has been. Though their [worldly] origins are ordinary and humble in most cases, they end up being the most important people in the world.</p>
<p>这确实是世界上独一无二的个体，而且一直如此。虽然在大多数情况下，他们的[世俗]出身平凡卑微，但最终却成为了世界上最重要的人。</p>
<p>They are sent by the Angelic Presence. They are imbued with the Message, which is greater than them, which is greater than their understanding, which is greater than anything they could conceive of themselves. It has the Power of God within it. It has the power of Initiation.</p>
<p>他们是天使存在派来的。他们被注入了讯息，这讯息比他们更伟大，比他们的理解力更伟大，比他们自己所能想象的任何事物都伟大。它蕴含着上帝的力量。它具有入门的力量。</p>
<p>No Messenger could think this up. No Messenger could conceive of this and construct this. This is not a teaching based upon an eclectic approach or a revised version of existing traditions. Spiritual teachers around the world in all traditions do this, but the Messenger brings something greater.</p>
<p>没有信使能想到这一切。没有信使能构思并构建这一切。这不是基于折衷方法或现有传统的修订版的教导。世界各地所有传统中的精神导师都在做这些，但信使带来了更伟大的启示。</p>
<p>The Messenger is not magnificent. The Messenger is not so awe inspiring that everyone around him immediately recognizes this person’s importance and uniqueness.</p>
<p>信使并不华丽。信使不是那么令人敬畏，以至于周围的每个人都能立刻认识到这个人的重要性和独特性。</p>
<p>This has never been the case for God’s Messengers. They were treated very poorly. They were ignored, or denied, or brutally treated—hardly recognized by those around them. Only a very few had this recognition, and they would play an important part in the Messenger’s development and early ministry and later successes.</p>
<p>对于上帝的信使来说，这种情况从未改变过。他们总是受到极其糟糕的对待，被忽视、否认，甚至残酷地对待——几乎没有得到周围人的认可。只有极少数人能够认出他们，这些人将在信使的发展、早期的传道以及后来的成功中发挥重要作用。</p>
<p>Now for the first time, the power of Revelation is being given around the world all at once—not in one tribe, not in one specific region, not in one important place in the world. For the world now is connected, and the Messenger will speak to the whole world, and the whole world can turn against him as well. The opportunity is immense, but so are the hazards involved.</p>
<p>现在，启示的力量第一次在全世界同时传递，不是在一个部落，不是在一个特定的地区，也不是在世界上一个重要的地方。因为现在全世界都连在一起了，信使将对全世界说话，全世界也可以反过来对付他。机会是巨大的，但其中的危险也是巨大的。</p>
<p>As always, religious figures will be threatened once his voice becomes heard, once the impact upon people grows, once his Message begins to take hold. And though he is not here to attack governments or overturn brutal dictatorships or to be revolutionary in this way at all; though he brings peace, cooperation and equanimity, he will be treated like an enemy by those who claim to be religious, by those who claim to represent God and God’s Will, by the followers of all the previous Messengers.</p>
<p>一如既往，一旦他的声音被人们听到，一旦他对人们的影响越来越大，一旦他的讯息开始深入人心，宗教人物就会受到威胁。虽然他不是来攻击政府、推翻残暴的独裁统治或以这种方式进行革命的；虽然他带来了和平、合作与平静，他仍然会被那些自称为宗教人士、声称代表上帝及上帝旨意的人，被之前所有信使的追随者视为敌人。</p>
<p>Many will consider him an enemy and a threat. This shows you how far they really are from the Source of their own traditions and how weak is Knowledge within them, the greater mind that God has given to all people.</p>
<p>许多人会把他视为敌人和威胁。这就告诉你，他们离自己传统的源头到底有多远，他们内心的内识，也就是上帝赋予所有人的更伟大的心灵，又有多么薄弱。</p>
<p>It will be easier for the ordinary person to recognize the Messenger. It will be easier for the person who has few preconceived notions and no investment in their position in society to recognize the Messenger.</p>
<p>普通人会更容易认出信使。对于那些没有什么先入为主的观念，对自己在社会中的地位没有任何投资的人来说，认识信使会更容易。</p>
<p>You can deny him. You can disclaim him. But he has the Message, and he is bringing it forth, in the purest form possible.</p>
<p>你可以否认他。你可以不承认他。但他携带着讯息，并以最纯粹的形式将它传递到世界。</p>
<p>You can even hear the Voice of Revelation now, which was never possible before and which has never happened before. Yes, Angelic Voices have been heard speaking to very specific things, and this has been recorded at times, but a New Message from God has never been recorded in its pure form.</p>
<p>你现在甚至可以听到启示的声音，这在以前是不可能的，也是从未发生过的。是的，人们曾听到天使的声音对非常具体的事情说话，这有时也被记录下来，但来自上帝的新讯息从未以它纯粹的形式被记录下来。</p>
<p>To recognize the Messenger, you must have the eyes to see and the ears to hear. You must be willing to set aside your preconceived notions and your grievances against religion and your firm beliefs about God, religion and spirituality to have a pure and real experience.</p>
<p>要想认识信使，你必须有看的眼睛和听的耳朵。你必须愿意放下先入为主的观念，放下对宗教的不满，放下对上帝、宗教和精神性的坚定信念，才能获得纯粹而真实的体验。</p>
<p>The Messenger will not condemn religions of the world, but he will provide in contrast the very essence of their Teachings that has been lost, forgotten or denied.</p>
<p>信使不会谴责世界上的宗教，但他会以对比的方式提供这些宗教教义中已经丢失、遗忘或被否定的精髓。</p>
<p>He will bring a new reality into the world that will require all religions to reassess their primary and fundamental ideas and beliefs. Though he has no violence within him, he will turn the tables upside down by his proclamation, by his presence in the world and by the Revelation itself.</p>
<p>他将为世界带来新的现实，要求所有宗教重新评估其主要的基本思想和信仰。虽然他的内心没有暴力，但他将通过他的宣告、他在这个世界上的存在以及启示本身来扭转局面。</p>
<p>People will become obsessed about who he thinks he is or says he is or who he could be because they are afraid of the Revelation. They cannot deal with the Message, so they will become preoccupied with the Messenger. They will complain. They will accuse him of things. They will think that for the Message to be true, the Messenger has to meet their criteria. They will complain, as if they know what the criteria for the Messenger are. Such foolishness and arrogance, but many people hold these views and base their ideas upon them.</p>
<p>人们会纠结于他认为自己是谁，或者他说自己是谁，或者他可能是谁，因为他们害怕启示。他们无法处理讯息，所以会对信使斤斤计较。他们会抱怨。他们会指责信使。他们会认为，要使讯息真实，信使就必须符合他们的标准。他们会抱怨，就好像他们知道信使的标准是什么。如此愚昧和傲慢，但很多人都持有这些观点，并以此为依据。</p>
<p>Oh, he must give people what they want, or they will not want him. All Messengers have faced this fundamental and unavoidable dilemma.</p>
<p>是的，他必须给人们想要的东西，否则他们就不会想要他。所有信使都曾面临过这种根本的、不可避免的困境。</p>
<p>He is not here to give you what you want. He may not even give you what you think you need in the moment. But he is giving you the pathway to your own personal revelation, to your restoration and your redemption. And he is bringing it to you in the clearest possible terms.</p>
<p>他不是来给你想要的东西的。他甚至可能不会给你你当下认为需要的东西。但他给了你通往个人启示、恢复和救赎之路。他用最清晰的语言向你讲述。</p>
<p>He is speaking to a literate world now, so the Teaching is not clothed and concealed in pastoral terms, or anecdotes or stories that have to require human commentary for people to understand their meaning.</p>
<p>他现在是在向一个识字的世界讲话，所以他的教导并不是用牧歌式的语言、轶事或故事来掩盖和隐藏的，这些都需要人的评论才能让人们理解其中的含义。</p>
<p>The Revelation is given pure and simple. But it is so deep that people will have to be with it in a new way, for it is not an intellectual enterprise. It is a matter of the heart and of the soul.</p>
<p>启示的内容纯粹而简单。但它是如此深刻，以至于人们必须以一种新的方式与之相处，因为它不是一项智力事业。它关乎内心和灵魂。</p>
<p>The Angelic Assembly understands the predicament of bringing something this powerful and pure into the world, and the crisis it will create for people as to whether they can receive and accept this, and the challenge it will give to them to reform their own lives and to establish their connection with Knowledge, the greater intelligence that God has given them, which waits to be discovered.</p>
<p>天使圣团理解将如此强大而纯粹的启示带入世界的困境，以及这将为人们带来的危机——是否能接纳和接受它，以及启示将带给他们的挑战——促使他们改变自己的生活，并建立与内识的连接，这种更高的智能是上帝赋予人们的礼物，等待被发现。</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Revelation has provided the Steps to Knowledge at the very beginning of the Revelation that the pathway would be established and not created later by imaginative peoples, and that the clarity and purpose would be established clearly, and not re-established later by those who did not know the Messenger.</p>
<p>正因如此，启示在最初阶段就提供了内识之路的步骤，以确保路径被确立，而不是由富有想象力的人们后来创造的，并且明确性和目的性得到清晰确立，而不是由那些不知道信使的人后来重新确立。</p>
<p>The risk of corruption is so great. The risk of misinterpretation is so great. The risk of misunderstanding is so great. That is why the Revelation is repetitive—repeating over and over again its purpose, its aim, its pathway and the obstacles and problems that people will have to face to begin to gain a true relationship with their deeper nature, and to have the chance of discovering their greater purpose in the world, and all the forgiveness and reconsideration that this will require, given how they view themselves and the world today.</p>
<p>腐败的风险如此巨大。误会解释的风险如此巨大。误会理解的风险如此巨大。这就是为什么启示是重复的——反复强调其目的、目标、路径以及人们必须面对的障碍和问题，以便开始建立与自己内心更深层面自然的真实关系，并有机会发现自己在世界上的更伟大目的，以及这将要求的所有宽恕和重新审视，鉴于他们今天对自己和世界的看法。</p>
<p>The Messenger does not bring peace. He brings challenge. He brings opportunity. He brings restoration. He brings work. He brings true relationship. He brings the Divine Will and Purpose into the world.</p>
<p>信使带来的不是和平。他带来的是挑战。他带来机遇。他带来恢复。他带来工作。他带来真实的关系。他给世界带来神圣的意志和宗旨。</p>
<p>He brings the Revelation that can save humanity from collapse within the world and from the risk of subjugation from beyond the world. He brings things that are so great that people have never even thought of them before.</p>
<p>他带来启示，能够拯救人类免于世界内部的崩溃和世界外部的征服风险。他带来了人们从未想到过的伟大启示。</p>
<p>He speaks to the needs of the future as well as the present. He speaks to the needs of the people a century from now who are facing a world catastrophically changed. He speaks to those who will have to face the Greater Community of life in the future and even those who are experiencing contact at this moment.</p>
<p>他既针对未来的需要，也针对现在的需要。他说的是一个世纪后的人们的需要，他们面临的是一个灾难性变化的世界。他对那些在未来必须面对生命大社区的人讲话，甚至对那些此刻正在经历接触的人讲话。</p>
<p>He brings the solution to a thousand questions and problems, beyond what people know of today—what will secure and create human freedom and sovereignty in the universe, where freedom is rare, where everything will be done short of invasion to take advantage of a weak and unsuspecting humanity.</p>
<p>他带来了千百个问题和难题的解决方案，超越了今天人们所知道的——什么才能在宇宙中确保并创造人类的自由和主权，在宇宙中，自由是罕见的，所有手段都将被用来利用脆弱和毫无防备的人类，直到侵略发生。</p>
<p>People know nothing of this. People know nothing of the real hazards facing the world today. They are living in their own little dream, preoccupied with their needs and problems. They have no idea what is going to threaten human civilization, both from within and from without. But the Revelation brings this awareness.</p>
<p>人们对此一无所知。人们对当今世界面临的真正危险一无所知。他们生活在自己的小梦中，一心只想着自己的需求和问题。他们不知道什么会从内部和外部威胁人类文明。但启示带来了这种觉知。</p>
<p>For only God can reveal what life is like in the universe, and this is part of the Revelation. Only God can reveal what is coming over the horizon for humanity, and this is revealed in the Revelation. Only God can speak to the deeper needs of the heart and the soul, and this is the center of the Revelation. From the needs of the whole world, both now and in the future, to the fundamental and core needs of you the individual, at this moment, the Revelation speaks of all these things, for they are all connected, you see.</p>
<p>因为只有上帝才能揭示宇宙中的生命是什么样的，这是启示的一部分。只有上帝才能揭示人类地平线上即将发生的事情，这也是启示的内容。只有上帝才能说出内心和灵魂深处的需求，这就是启示的中心。从整个世界现在和未来的需求，到你个人此时此刻最基本、最核心的需求，启示讲述了所有这些事情，因为它们都是相互关联的，你看。</p>
<p>The Messenger speaks of living a greater life in service to a world in need. Surely, this need is growing with each passing day and will escalate beyond what people estimate today.</p>
<p>信使谈到了为需要帮助的世界服务的更伟大生命。当然，这种需求与日俱增，并将超出人们今天的估计。</p>
<p>He calls people out of their miserable attempt at self-fulfillment, their tragedies, their predicaments, their entrapment, [calling] people out of political and social and religious oppression to find the voice that God has put within them to find and to follow.</p>
<p>他呼唤人们走出自我实现的悲惨尝试、悲剧、困境、禁锢，[呼唤]人们走出政治、社会和宗教压迫，找到上帝放置在他们内心的声音，去寻找和追随。</p>
<p>For this, he will be denied and condemned by those who have invested in other things, by those whose views are threatened; whose position in life is questioned; whose values, ethics and firm beliefs are thrown into doubt by his proclamation and by the nature of the Revelation itself.</p>
<p>为此，他将受到那些投资于其他事物的人、那些观点受到威胁的人、那些生活地位受到质疑的人、那些价值观、道德观和坚定信念因他的宣告和启示本身的性质而受到怀疑的人的否定和谴责。</p>
<p>The Angelic Presence knows that if he can reach enough people within the span of his time, the Revelation will take hold in the world. But many things have delayed the Messenger. People have not responded who were destined to do so. There have been financial setbacks, grave serious illness and the great challenge of penetrating the ignorance and preoccupations of humanity.</p>
<p>天使的存在知道，如果他能在自己的时间跨度内接触到足够多的人，启示就会在世界上占据一席之地。但许多事情耽搁了信使。那些注定要回应的人却没有回应。经济上的挫折、严重的疾病，以及深入人类的无知和妄想的巨大挑战。</p>
<p>That is why anyone who can respond to the Messenger must truly respond. And time is of the essence, for he is an older man, and his presence in the world is of critical importance for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>这就是为什么任何能够回应信使的人都必须真正回应的原因。时间至关重要，因为他是一位年长者，他在这个世界上的存在对人类的未来至关重要。</p>
<p>This time, the Angelic Presence presented the Message first before the Messenger would even proclaim himself. In that way, the Message has been preserved. It has been printed. It has been established. Even if the Messenger should meet calamity tomorrow, the Message is here, and there are enough people now to speak for it and carry it forward. This is to prevent usurpation and corruption, for the Message speaks clearly, without a great need for human commentary or intervention.</p>
<p>这一次，天使的存在在信使自我宣告之前首先呈现了讯息。以这种方式，讯息得以保存、印刷并确立。即使信使明天会遭遇灾难，讯息仍在这里，而且现在有足够的人为它说话，并将它发扬光大。这是为了防止篡夺和腐败，因为新讯息清晰地表达了内容，不需要大量的人工评论或干预。</p>
<p>Yet the Messenger contains more than what is in print and what has been recorded. That is why if you can reach the Messenger and hear the Messenger, you will hear things beyond what has been printed and recorded.</p>
<p>然而，信使所包含的内容远远超过印刷和记录的内容。这就是为什么如果你能接触到信使，听到信使的声音，你就会听到超越印刷和记录的内容。</p>
<p>For he carries the Message within him like a fire. It burns. But it warms the soul and illuminates the landscape. The Fire of Knowledge within the Messenger is unlike any fire in the world. It is so powerful even he can barely stand it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>因为他内心携带着讯息，如同一团火焰。它燃烧着，但它温暖了灵魂，照亮它的风景。信使内心的内识之火与世界上的任何火焰都不同。它如此强烈，甚至他自己也很难长时间承受。</p>
<p>Your relationship with him is important. You do not yet realize its importance. But he must be seen correctly. He must be seen from the soul and the heart. He must be heard, and the nature of Revelation must be understood sufficiently so that you can understand the great opportunity this is giving to you and to the world.</p>
<p>你和他的关系很重要。你还没有意识到它的重要性。但必须正确看待他。必须从灵魂和内心来看待他。必须倾听他的声音，必须充分理解启示的本质，这样你才能理解它给你和世界带来的伟大机会。</p>
<p>For it will be centuries before another Messenger is sent. This is it. This is the one. This is the real Message for the world for this time and the times to come.</p>
<p>因为要等几个世纪之后，才会有另一位信使被派遣来到这里。就是他了。这就是现在的唯一信使。这是给这个时代和未来世界的真正讯息。</p>
<p>Fail to respond here, and the consequences will be great for your life and for the world. You will not find your destiny. You will not find your calling. You will be lost at sea with everyone else—groping, searching, suffering. Knowledge within you will be alive, but you may never find a way to connect with it. And your grievance against the world will grow as the world diminishes. And your grief and your anguish will increase as human suffering around you increases. And you will feel helpless and hopeless regarding your position in the universe, for you have not found the power of Knowledge yet to redeem you.</p>
<p>如果在这里没有回应，你的生命和世界都将面临巨大的后果。你将找不到自己的天命。你将找不到自己的召唤。你将与其他人一起迷失在茫茫大海中——摸索、寻找、受苦。你的内识将是鲜活的，但你可能永远也找不到与之联系的方式。你对世界的怨恨会随着世界的缩小而增加。你的悲伤和痛苦会随着你周围人类苦难的增加而增加。你会对自己在宇宙中的位置感到无助和绝望，因为你还没有找到内识的力量来救赎你。</p>
<p>This is the consequence of living at a time of Revelation. It is not just a matter of choosing this over that. It is not one teaching versus another teaching. It is the crucial thing that will make all the difference. Success and failure here are utterly consequential for the individual, for you.</p>
<p>这就是生活在启示时代的后果。这不仅仅是选择这个还是那个的问题。这不是一个教导与另一个教导的问题。这是决定一切的关键所在。在这里的成功与失败对个人而言，尤其是对你而言，是至关重要的。</p>
<p>This is why people think that Revelation cannot happen again because they really do not want to deal with the challenge and the opportunity and the re-evaluation it will require and present. Better to live with old Revelations that have been well established, where human commentary has overlaid them so completely that it is hard to really understand what the Revelations were talking about in the first place.</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们认为启示不可能再次出现，因为他们真的不想应对它所要求和带来的挑战、机会和重新评估。他们更愿意生活在那些已经确立的旧启示之中，人类的评论已经完全覆盖了这些启示，以至于很难真正理解这些启示最初在谈论什么。</p>
<p>They [the old Revelations] have become the establishment. They have become the institution. They have become the accepted norm. There are individuals who recognize their true value and attempt to live this value. But for most people this is simply what is expected of them in their culture and nation—to believe and to follow, to some degree at least, but never with great seriousness or real devotion.</p>
<p>它们（旧的启示）已经成为既定的观念。它们已成为制度。它们已成为公认的准则。有些人认识到了自己的真实价值，并试图实现这个价值。但对大多数人来说，这只是他们的文化和国家对他们的期望——至少在某种程度上相信并遵循，但从未认真对待或真正的进行奉献。</p>
<p>So into this compromised environment, God has spoken again and sent a Messenger into the world, sent from the Angelic Presence and Host to deliver a new reality, to shake people out of their complacency, to call people out of the shadows of their past, to bring clarity and resolution where there is only opinion and speculation, to take people beyond belief and their intellectual understanding to a greater reality of recognition and redemption.</p>
<p>因此，在这个妥协的环境中，上帝再次讲话，向这个世界派遣了一位信使，这位信使由天使的存在和群体派遣而来，传递一个新的现实，震撼人们的自满情绪，召唤人们走出过去的阴影，在只有意见和猜测的地方带来清晰和解决，将人们带到超越信仰和智力理解的更大认知和救赎的现实之中。</p>
<p>If you can understand the origin of the Messenger, you will begin to understand your origin and what has called you into the world, which is an entirely different way of looking at your life—your present life, your past life and your future—and indeed a remarkable way of looking at the world. For there will be no condemnation here, only recognition and determination and great compassion for humanity as it struggles to find its real strength at a time of Revelation.</p>
<p>如果你能理解信使的起源，你就会开始理解你的起源，理解是什么召唤你来到这个世界，这将是一种完全不同的看待你生命的方式——你的今生、你的前世和你的未来的方式，实际上也是一种非凡的看待世界的方式。因为这里没有谴责，只有认知和决心，以及对人类在启示时期努力寻找自身真正力量的极大同情。</p>
