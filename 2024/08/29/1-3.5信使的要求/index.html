<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on March 12, 2013 in Boulder, CO<br>2013年3月12日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely, one who is called and prepared to bring a New Message from God into the world must have a long and very challenging preparation. It is the preparation an individual could not initiate for themselves.</p>
<p>当然，一个被召唤并准备好将上帝的新讯息带入世界的人，必须有长期且极具挑战性的准备。这是个人无法为自己启动的准备。</p>
<p>It must be a calling from Heaven itself. It must be administered by Heaven itself. It must take the one chosen from their former life and state of mind into a new life and a far greater state of mind over a period of time.</p>
<p>它必须来自天国本身的召唤。它必须由天国亲自管理。它必须将被选中的人从他们以往的生命和心灵状态带入一种个新的生命以及远超于以前的心灵状态，这个过程需要一定的时间。</p>
<p>It is a preparation with many challenges and many tests. It is not a journey any individual could invent for themselves, for their own edification or self-proclamation, though many have tried, and certainly others in the future will try as well.</p>
<p>这是一个充满许多挑战和考验的准备过程。这不是任何个人能够为自己发明的旅程，既不是为了自我启发，也不是为了自我宣扬，尽管许多人曾尝试过，未来肯定还会有人尝试。</p>
<p>God’s Messenger is no ordinary person. God’s Messenger is not simply someone who was called out of the crowd and given an important task in life, or [asked] to carry an important message, like a postman. It is someone who must come from the Angelic Presence itself, and be initiated into the world, and be given time to develop as a human being facing the pleasures and the hazards and the disappointments of living in Separation.</p>
<p>上帝的信使不是普通人。上帝的信使不是简单地从人群中被召唤出来，并被赋予一项重要任务的人，也不是像邮递员一样[被要求]传递重要讯息的人。他必须来自天使的存在本身，被启动进入这个世界，并有时间发展成为一个人，面对生活在分离中的快乐、危险和失望。</p>
<p>It must be one of the Angelic Assembly who can do such a task. So never think that God’s Messenger is simply some witless person who was chosen and burdened with a great and important mission. No, indeed. This individual would have to have unique qualities and a greater association to be able to assume such a pivotal and important role in life.</p>
<p>能够完成这项任务的，一定是天使圣团的成员。所以，千万不要认为上帝的信使只是某个被选中并担负着伟大而重要使命的无智之人。的确不是。这个人必须具备独特的品质和更伟大的关联，才能在生活中承担如此关键和重要的角色。</p>
<p>For here failure is incredibly damaging, not only to the one chosen but to all of humanity. For if the Message cannot be received correctly and interpreted and communicated correctly, then it will have been corrupted. It would be incomplete.</p>
<p>因为这里的失败不仅对被选中者，而且对全人类都会造成极大的伤害。因为如果讯息不能被正确接收，不能被正确解释和传播，那么它就会被败坏。它将是不完整的。</p>
<p>For, you see, the Message requires the Messenger, and the Messenger has to have the qualities necessary to carry out such a great and demanding task. If the individual does not have such qualities, then they cannot emanate the Presence. They cannot carry the burden. They will never be selfless enough to sacrifice their own needs and pleasures along the way. Invariably, if they were not chosen for such a task, they would not be able to complete such a mission.</p>
<p>因为，你看，讯息需要信使，而信使必须具备执行如此伟大而艰巨任务的必要品质。如果这个人没有这些品质，那么他们就无法散发出存在的力量，无法承担这个重任。他们永远不会足够无私，无法在过程中牺牲自己的需求和享乐。无一例外，如果他们没有被选中执行这样的任务，他们就无法完成这样的使命。</p>
<p>Certainly, those who follow the Messenger, now and in the future, may be prone to misinterpret and misapply God’s New Revelation for humanity. And sadly that will occur because people do not yet have the clarity and integrity and understanding yet to be able to carry such a Message forth beyond the time of the Messenger.</p>
<p>当然，现在和将来追随信使的人可能容易曲解和误用上帝给人类的新启示。可悲的是，这种情况会发生，因为人们还不具备清晰、正直和理解的能力，无法在信使的时代之后继续传递这样的讯息。</p>
<p>That is why certain people are chosen and selected to do this at the very center of the Messenger’s life. They too must prepare and meet requirements. They too must follow an inexplicable journey not of their own making. They too must face great uncertainty and opposition in the world. They too must hold the vision and the Fire of Knowledge despite the chaos they see around them and the tragic nature of the human pursuit for happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>这就是为什么某些人被选中并被挑选到信使生活的中心来做这件事。他们也必须做好准备，满足要求。他们也必须遵循一段无法解释的旅程，而这并非他们自己选择的。他们也必须面对世界上巨大的不确定性和反对。尽管他们看到周围一片混乱，尽管人类追求幸福和满足的过程充满了悲剧色彩，但他们也必须坚持自己的愿景和内识之火。</p>
<p>The requirements of the Messenger are very unique. And We give them to you now so that you may understand this person, that you might recognize what is required and recognize that only one is given the responsibility to receive and to initiate the proclamation of God’s New Revelation. Once you understand the requirements, perhaps, you will be able to accept this yourself.</p>
<p>信使的要求非常独特。我们现在把这些要求告诉你，是为了让你理解这个人，让你认识到所需要的条件，认识到只有一个人被赋予接收和启动上帝新启示的责任。一旦你理解了这些要求，也许你就能够接受这一点。</p>
<p>First, the Messenger, before he even knows he is the Messenger or has any idea of this, must be held back from giving his life away to people, places and things. He will need to be educated fundamentally, but he cannot commit himself to family and career until his moment of initiation occurs, which would be later in his life, beyond his early youth. Therefore, he must be restrained, and he must restrain himself. He must honor the feeling within himself to be restrained.</p>
<p>首先，信使在还不知道自己是信使或对此有任何想法之前，就必须被牵制住，不能把自己的生命交给人、地方和事物。他需要从根本上接受教育，但在他的入门时刻到来之前，他不能把自己交付给家庭和事业。因此，他必须克制，必须克制自己。他必须尊重自己内心的克制感。</p>
<p>He must not become politically engaged. He must not become seriously socially engaged. He must not have radical views. He must be very healthy. He must grow up in a healthy family, but be able to move beyond that family and its obligations and expectations. He must not have any religious training, or be religiously oriented particularly, so that his ideas do not become preconceived and formulated early in life. He must respect religion, but not become closely tied to it in any form.</p>
<p>他不能参与政治。他不能严肃地参与社会活动。不能有激进的观点。他必须非常健康。他必须在一个健康的家庭中成长，但能够超越家庭及其义务和期望。他不能接受过任何宗教训练，也不能特别信奉宗教，这样他的思想才不会先入为主，才不会过早地形成。他必须尊重宗教，但不能以任何形式与宗教紧密相连。</p>
<p>He will have to be willing to wait a very long time for his true partner and mate to arrive. And he must feel this and know this within himself sufficiently so as not to pursue romance or commitment in relationship before it is appropriate for him to do so.</p>
<p>他必须愿意等待很长一段时间，等待他真实的合作伙伴和配偶的到来。他必须充分感受到这一点，并在内心深处知道这一点，这样才不会在他适合追求浪漫或承诺的关系之前就这样做。</p>
<p>He must not become an ardent spiritual practitioner, for this will set in train preconceived notions that would only have to be undone later. So it is better that he restrain himself and be restrained even from this.</p>
<p>他绝不能成为一个狂热的精神上的修行者，因为这会让他先入为主地形成一些观念，而这些观念只能在以后才能消除。因此，他最好克制自己，甚至在这方面也要克制。</p>
<p>His youth will be ordinary, but exceptional in some ways. He will not understand himself or his motivations, for that could not be understood at this early stage. He will have to trust a feeling that will only be there intermittently.</p>
<p>他的青春将是平凡的，但在某些方面又是特殊的。他不会理解他自己或自己的动机，因为这在早期阶段是无法理解的。他将不得不信任一种感觉，而这种感觉只会断断续续地存在。</p>
<p>He will have to want things but not have them, without knowing why. While everyone around him is giving themselves over to people, places and things, he cannot do this.</p>
<p>他会想要一些东西却无法得到，而不知道它的原因。当他周围的每个人都在将自己奉献给人、事、物时，他却不能这样做。</p>
<p>He must learn about relationships, human passion and the follies of romance. He must see people committing all manner of errors and mistakes, without condemnation.</p>
<p>他必须学习人与人之间的关系、人类的激情和浪漫的谬误。他必须看到人们犯下的各种错误，而不去谴责他们。</p>
<p>He must wait. That is so very important here to understand. For who can wait? Can you wait, really wait, for the time, for the moment?</p>
<p>他必须等待。这一点非常重要。谁能等待？你能等待吗，真正的等待，等待时间，等待时机的到来？</p>
<p>When the Rays of Initiation would be shone upon him so powerfully, it would obliterate his former life and sever his connections, just enough so that he could be free to embark on a greater journey—a journey not of his own making, a journey that no one around him could understand, except perhaps the very wise.</p>
<p>当启蒙之光如此强烈地照耀在他身上时，它将摧毁他过去的生命，切断与过去的连接，这样他就可以自由地踏上一段更伟大的旅程——一段不是他自己创造的旅程，一段他周围的人都无法理解的旅程，除了极少数非常明智的人。</p>
<p>He would have to study and train for this Initiation. He would have to begin to teach the inexplicable Teaching in The Way of Knowledge and begin to learn its fundamental and primary lessons.</p>
<p>他必须为这次启蒙进行学习和训练。他必须开始教授这种无法解释的内识之路的教导，并开始学习其中最基本、最主要的课程。</p>
<p>He would have to be intelligent but yielding, capable but ready for something greater without knowing what it is, what it is for or where it would take him.</p>
<p>他必须聪慧而又屈服，有能力但为更伟大的事情做好准备，而不知道它是什么，它的目的是什么，它将把他带向何方。</p>
<p>At his moment of great Initiation, he would have to be able to maintain his internal composure and to follow the directives that would certainly arise from such a monumental encounter, an encounter that few people in the world have ever had at this level of intensity.</p>
<p>在他伟大的启蒙时刻，他必须能够保持内心的镇定，并遵循从如此重大遭遇中必然产生的指示，世界上很少有人经历过如此强度的遭遇。</p>
<p>Only the Jesus, the Buddha and the Muhammad have been struck in this manner. For they too have come from the Angelic Assembly, as has the Messenger for this time and for this world.</p>
<p>只有耶稣、佛陀和穆罕默德受到过这样的冲击。因为他们也来自天使圣团，就像信使为这个时代和这个世界所做的一样。</p>
<p>People can claim any title they want. They can assume anything. They can believe anything. They can imagine anything. But only Heaven knows who is to receive a preparation of this nature, and for what purpose, and for what ultimate end.</p>
<p>人们可以宣称他们想要的任何头衔。他们可以假定任何事情。他们可以相信任何事。他们可以想象任何事情。但只有天国知道，谁将接受这种性质的准备，为了什么目的，最终的目的又是什么。</p>
<p>The Messenger then would have to begin to unravel his former life, to leave his relationships and to embark on a period of wandering. For nine months, he wandered, not knowing what he was doing, not knowing where he was going, with just enough money to support him during this period.</p>
<p>然后，信使必须开始解开他过去的生活，离开他的关系，并踏上一段漂泊的时期。在这九个月里，他游荡着，不知道自己在做什么，不知道要去哪里，只有足够的钱来支撑他度过这段时间。</p>
<p>He would have to go where he was meant to go. He would have to not engage himself seriously in any relationship. He [would have to not] run away, and try to be safe anywhere or secure or loved or protected. With a greater destiny, he cannot give himself to these things.</p>
<p>他必须去他该去的地方。他不能在任何关系中认真投入。他[不得不]逃避，试图在任何地方获得安全感、保障、关爱或保护。有了更伟大的天命，他就不能把自己交给这些东西。</p>
<p>At the end of nine months, We came upon him again and told him to begin to prepare to record, which he did. And that began, very early, the transmission of God’s New Revelation. Yet it would be a long time before he would know what it was for, why it was even occurring, for there was no assurance at the beginning.</p>
<p>九个月后，我们再次来到他身边，让他开始准备记录，他照做了。上帝的新启示就这样开始了。然而，过了很长时间，他才知道这是为了什么，为什么要这样做，因为一开始并没有任何保证。</p>
<p>He was not given his role at the beginning, for he would have to prove himself now, again and again. For seven years, he would have to prove himself and prepare to receive the Angelic Presence, which he could only do for moments at a time at the outset.</p>
<p>他一开始就没有被赋予自己的角色，因为他现在必须一次又一次地证明自己。七年来，他必须证明自己，并准备接收天使的临在，在最初，他只能在短暂的时间里接纳天使的临在。</p>
<p>He would have to record. He would have to provide Our testimony to certain people.</p>
<p>他必须记录下来。他必须向某些人提供我们的证词。</p>
<p>He would have to move his family around repeatedly to certain places that were important for him to experience, to learn of the Greater Community and of the more hidden powers working in the world today, both for and against humanity.</p>
<p>他必须反复将家庭搬到一些对他而言重要的地方，他需要去体验、去学习大社区以及当前在世界上运作的更隐秘的力量，这些力量既对人类有利，也对人类不利。</p>
<p>His partner would arrive, and his son soon after. He would be a father and a husband and have to be responsible in all ways here, but still being guided by a mysterious Light, without a certain outcome or destiny. For these things would not be revealed to him until much, much later.</p>
<p>他的伴侣将会到来，随后他的儿子也会出生。他将成为父亲和丈夫，必须在所有方面承担责任，但他仍然受到神秘之光的指引，没有确定的结果或天命。这些事情直到很久以后才会向他揭示。</p>
<p>He would have to be strong emotionally. He would have to be stable. He would have to be dependable and reliable, day in and day out, and build his strength in this way, as well as his deeper connection to those who sent him here.</p>
<p>他在情感上必须坚强。他必须稳定。他必须日复一日地可靠和可信赖，并以此增强自己的力量，以及与那些派遣他来这里的天使存在之间有更深层面的连接。</p>
<p>He would receive entire teachings. He would begin to lay the foundation, brick by brick, of the greatest Revelation ever given to humanity—beginning with people’s personal realms, beginning the teaching on how to receive a Revelation and to learn over time how to live it and to share it with others.</p>
<p>他将接收到完整的教导。他将开始一砖一瓦地为人类有史以来最伟大的启示打下基础——从人们个人的领域开始，开始教导人们如何接收启示，并随着时间的推移学会如何生活在启示之中并与他人分享。</p>
<p>After seven years, he would receive Steps to Knowledge, the book of preparation in God’s New Revelation. He would have to be able to receive the Assembly for long periods of time, for days on end, to receive this important teaching and preparation for humanity.</p>
<p>七年后，他将收到《内识的进阶》，这是上帝新启示中的准备之书。他必须能够长时间地、连续几天地接纳天使圣团的临在，接收这个重要的教导，为人类做准备。</p>
<p>He would have to relocate to do this and leave his former home entirely, never to return, and take his family with him, along with others to assist him in this great endeavor.</p>
<p>为此，他必须搬迁来完成这项任务，完全离开他曾经的家，再也不返回，还要带上他的家人，以及其他协助他完成这项伟大事业的人。</p>
<p>From here, he would have to search for a future home for the Revelation. He would have to travel across the country again and again to find this place, for it cannot be merely told to him where to go. It must be experienced once he arrived. For he would have to take complete responsibility for his actions, even though he was being guided from above.</p>
<p>从这里开始，他必须为启示寻找未来的家园。为了找到这个地方，他必须一次又一次地走遍全国，因为不能只告诉他该去哪里。他必须在到达之后亲身经历。因为他必须为自己的行为承担全部责任，即使他受到了天国的指导。</p>
<p>He could not claim the Angels of God were directing him, for he was not allowed to do this. He had to be responsible for everything, and take responsibility for the consequences, and be accountable for his actions. For only certain people would be allowed to know the real secret of his life.</p>
<p>他不能声称是上帝的天使在指引他，因为他不能这样做。他必须对一切负责，对后果负责，对自己的行为负责。因为只有某些人才能知道他生命的真正秘密。</p>
<p>He would have to go through the difficult process of establishing a home in an entirely new place—where he knew no one, had no associations and no family and no history—and there to begin to receive the great books of the Revelation, and to begin to call people to assist him.</p>
<p>他必须经历一个艰难的过程，在一个全新的地方建立一个家——在那里他不知道任何人，没有任何联系，没有家庭，没有历史——在那里开始接收启示的伟大书籍，开始召唤人们来帮助他。</p>
<p>But he was not yet ready to be a world teacher. He did not yet have these strengths or this comprehension. And he would have to wait many years for the Revelation to be given to him, step by step, and build itself into a world Teaching and ultimately a New Message from God. It would only be later that the true purpose and meaning of his long journey would be revealed to him.</p>
<p>但他还没有做好成为世界教师的准备。他尚未具备这些力量或理解。他必须等待许多年，等待启示一步一步地传授给他，并将其发展成为世界的教导，最终成为来自上帝的新讯息。他漫长旅程的真实目的和意义只有在以后才会被揭示出来。</p>
<p>He had to undergo illness and incapacity for long periods of time from the great strain of undertaking this journey.</p>
<p>在进行这次旅行时，他承受了巨大的压力，他不得不长期忍受疾病以及丧失工作能力的困扰。</p>
<p>He would have to call certain people to assist him. He would have to raise his son, who would become an important person in the Revelation, and in the future of the Revelation in this world.</p>
<p>他必须召唤一些人来协助他。同时还必须抚养他的儿子，他的儿子将在启示中扮演重要的角色，并对未来产生重大影响。</p>
<p>Everyone around him would have to develop significantly, and not everyone would be able to do this. Certain people would fall away, yet others would stay with him faithfully. He would have great difficulties at this time of maintaining the beginning organization that would be responsible for transmitting and teaching God’s New Revelation for the world.</p>
<p>他身边的每个人都必须显著发展，但并不是每个人都能做到这一点。某些人会离开，而其他人则会忠实地与他在一起。此时，他要维持一个负责向全世界传播和传授上帝新启示的初创组织，会遇到很大的困难。</p>
<p>He would have to build the qualities of discernment, restraint and discretion, stability, faith, confidence and the ability to deal with small problems at every turn, and the needs of others that were genuine. He would have to be a pillar of strength. Even at this time of great uncertainty for him, he would have to be a pillar of strength for others.</p>
<p>他必须培养出辨别力、克制力和谨慎性，以及稳定性、信任、自信和处理各种小问题的能力，还要应对他人真正的需求。他必须成为力量的支柱。即使在他自己充满巨大不确定性的时期，他也必须为他人成为力量的支柱。</p>
<p>And all the while, his connection to the Assembly is growing, slowly, carefully, so as not to disable him from being able to be functional in the world, but to be a bridge between this world and the [spiritual] world beyond—strengthening his connection to each of these worlds and to the Beings that exist in each of these worlds.</p>
<p>与此同时，他与圣团的连接也在慢慢地、小心翼翼地增长，这样就不会使他丧失在这个世界上发挥作用的能力，而是成为这个世界与超越这个世界的[精神性]世界之间的桥梁——加强他与这两个世界以及存在于每一个世界中的生命之间的联系。</p>
<p>Here he could not surrender himself to God and give up all worldly activities, for he would be building the seeds and the foundation for great world activities and a great participation in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，他不能把自己交给上帝，放弃一切世俗活动，因为他正在为伟大的世俗活动和对世俗的伟大参与奠定种子和基础。</p>
<p>Here he would not become an ascetic and withdraw from life. He would be a husband and a father and a leader of an organization, all the while cultivating the great mystery of his life and purpose.</p>
<p>在这里，他不会成为禁欲主义者，不会退出世俗生活。他将成为一个丈夫、一个父亲和一个组织的领导者，与此同时，他还在探索自己的生命和目的的伟大神秘。</p>
<p>He would have to be responsible for everything he did and not reveal to others the Source of his guidance or the nature of the mystery of his life. Only his wife and son and a few others would know of these things.</p>
<p>他必须对自己所做的一切负责，不向他人透露他的指导来源或他生命神秘的本质。只有他的妻子和儿子以及其他少数人知道这些事情。</p>
<p>He would have to develop his skills as a teacher, not just for individuals but for groups of people, for his destiny would be to speak to a whole world in the future.</p>
<p>他必须发展自己作为教师的技能，不仅是针对个人，而且是针对群体，因为他的天命将是在未来与整个世界对话。</p>
<p>He would have to be compassionate, wise and competent, careful and discerning, patient, oh so very patient, with himself and others.</p>
<p>他必须富有同情心、智慧和能力、细心和辨别力，对自己和他人都要有耐心，是的，非常有耐心。</p>
<p>He would have to develop inner listening so that he could hear and feel the power of Knowledge speaking as he was serving the needs of others.</p>
<p>他必须培养内在的倾听能力，这样他才能在为他人的需要服务时，听到并感受到内识说话的力量。</p>
<p>He would have to let people come and go, for not everyone has the strength to undertake the preparation provided by God’s New Revelation.</p>
<p>他必须让人们来来去去，因为不是每个人都有力量承担上帝的新启示所提供的准备工作。</p>
<p>He would have to hold fast to his purpose and his direction through times of great emptiness when he would not hear from the Angelic Assembly. He would have to build his own strength based upon Knowledge within himself. For he would have to become the strong vehicle for something so great and profound that the world can barely understand it.</p>
<p>他必须在极度空虚的时期坚持自己的宗旨和方向，在那段时间里，他将不会听到来自天使圣团的声音。他必须基于内心深处的内识建立自己的力量。因为他必须成为一个坚强的载体，承载如此伟大而神秘的启示，以至于世界几乎无法理解。</p>
<p>Through more periods of difficulty with his health, he would begin the proclamation and to receive the teachings of the proclamation, even the teachings about himself, as the New Message began to become fulfilled and complete through him.</p>
<p>在经历了更多的健康困难时期之后，他将开始宣告来自上帝的新讯息，并接受宣告的教导，甚至是关于他自己的教导，因为新讯息开始通过他而实现和完成。</p>
<p>He would have to be humble, knowing that this was beyond him and greater than him. And yet he would have to be confident that he could take the next step and not seek an escape, as so many people do.</p>
<p>他必须谦逊，知道启示超越了他，比他更伟大。然而，他必须坚信自己能够迈出下一步，而不是像许多人那样寻求逃避。</p>
<p>His strength would have to be quiet. He would not declare himself. Only as the Revelation became complete would he begin to state its reality and have to admit that he really was the Messenger.</p>
<p>他的力量必须是安静的。他不会宣扬自己。只有当启示变得完整时，他才会开始陈述它的真实性，并不得不承认他真的是信使。</p>
<p>He would have to overcome his own reluctance, for only the reluctant are chosen. For the task is too great, too demanding, too uncertain and even too dangerous for people to choose wisely with real understanding.</p>
<p>他必须克服自己的不情愿，因为只有不情愿的人才会被选中。因为这项任务太艰巨、太繁重、太不确定，甚至太危险，人们无法真正理解，做出明智的选择。</p>
<p>He would have to cultivate the necessary abilities and refinements that Heaven would require. And this would take years and years and years, as it has taken for all the great Messengers. For no one, even if they are chosen, is ready at the outset.</p>
<p>他必须培养天国所要求的必要能力和修养。而这需要长年累月的努力，就像所有伟大的信使一样。因为没有人一开始就准备好了，即使他们被选中。</p>
<p>It has taken the Messenger 30 years to do this, and even longer given his early preparation. No one who is ambitious or self-determined could do this, could follow such an inexplicable journey and exercise such great forbearance, patience and stability. They would fall apart easily, for they do not have the inner strength or the greater connections with life to undertake such a greater task.</p>
<p>信使花了30年才做到这一点，考虑到他早期的准备，甚至花了更长的时间。没有一个雄心勃勃或自我决定的人能够做到这一点，能够追随这样一段莫名其妙的旅程，能够表现出如此大的忍耐力、耐心和稳定性。他们会很容易崩溃，因为他们没有内在的力量或与生命的更大连接来承担如此重大的任务。</p>
<p>He would have to be prepared to deal with the great difficulties of bringing the preparation to a world of great dissonance, fear, anger and distrust—where people are caught up in their beliefs and their admonitions, their failures and their pursuits of wealth and power.</p>
<p>他必须准备好应对巨大的困难，将准备工作带到一个充满不和谐、恐惧、愤怒和不信任的世界——在这个世界里，人们沉浸在自己的信仰和训诫中，沉浸在自己的失败和对财富与权力的追求中。</p>
<p>Who amongst them can hear God speaking again, through this individual? They may study their religions. They may even become religious teachers or scholars or advocates, but who can hear when God will speak again? Who has the humility to reconsider their ideas and beliefs? Who can listen to the stirrings of their heart and not merely be fixated in their beliefs and convictions and all that they have invested in, building up their position in the world?</p>
<p>他们当中有谁能听到上帝通过这个人再次讲话？他们可以研究自己的宗教。他们甚至可能成为宗教教师、学者或倡导者，但谁能听到上帝再次讲话？谁能谦逊地重新考虑自己的想法和信仰？谁能倾听他们内心的悸动，而不是仅仅固守自己的信仰和信念，以及他们所投入的一切，以建立自己在世界上的地位？</p>
<p>They would not receive the Messenger, who is the answer to their prayers. They would dispute him, condemn him and dismiss him, for they are not yet ready to receive him.</p>
<p>他们不会接受信使，而信使正是他们祈祷的答案。他们会质疑他、谴责他、解雇他，因为他们还没有准备好接受他。</p>
<p>The discouragement, the disappointment, the projections of evil and blame upon the Messenger will be heaped upon him as he proceeds. Even now he stands at the threshold of an unwelcoming world, seeking those individuals who can respond, who are ready to be amongst the first to receive the reality that God has spoken again.</p>
<p>在信使前进的过程中，他们会对他感到气馁、失望，对他投射邪恶和指责。即使是现在，他正站在一个不受欢迎的世界的门槛上，寻找那些能够做出回应的人，那些准备好成为第一批接纳上帝再次讲话这个现实的人。</p>
<p>They will come from every country, every nation, every culture, one by one, not in great groups. Hordes of people will not rush to the Revelation. It will begin with a calling, a great calling that not only exists in the outer world, but that exists in the inner world as well. And they will have to have the courage and the trust and the wisdom to respond.</p>
<p>他们将来自各个国家、各个民族、各种文化，一个接一个，而不是成群结队。成群结队的人不会匆忙赶来接受启示。它将始于一种召唤，一种不仅存在于外部世界，而且存在于内心世界的伟大召唤。他们必须有勇气、信任和智慧去回应。</p>
<p>If they do not respond and cannot respond and meet the requirements of their own calling, which is far less difficult and demanding than the Messenger’s, then the New Message may not build a hold or a footing in the world and be able to serve the world at this time as it is meant to do.</p>
<p>如果他们不作出回应，不能回应和满足自己的召唤要求，而自己的召唤远没有信使的召唤那样艰巨和苛刻，新讯息可能因此无法在世界上站稳脚跟并立足，也就无法在这个时候如愿以偿地为世界服务。</p>
<p>For humanity is at the verge of failure—destroying the world it lives in, falling into despair, falling into chaos, falling into endless war and conflict over who will have access to the remaining resources of the world.</p>
<p>因为人类正处于失败的边缘——毁灭自己生活的世界，陷入绝望，陷入混乱，陷入无休止的战争和冲突，争夺谁能获得世界上剩余的资源。</p>
<p>So this is not a Revelation for some distant need, but for the immediate needs of people everywhere. For to live without the power of Knowledge is to live in great fear and uncertainty. It is to suffer.</p>
<p>因此，这并不是为某个遥远需求而来的启示，而是为了满足世界各地人们眼前需求的启示。因为没有内识力量的生活，就意味着生活在巨大的恐惧和不确定性之中。这是一种持续的痛苦。</p>
<p>The Messenger is here to relieve that suffering, to give people strength and power, and to reveal to them the Will of Heaven and the real nature of their spirituality and greater calling in the world, and what the world will really need from them, beyond what they themselves may want to give for their own happiness.</p>
<p>信使在这里是为了减轻这种痛苦，给人们力量和权力，向他们揭示天国的意志，揭示他们精神性的真正本质，揭示他们在这个世界上的更伟大召唤，揭示这个世界对他们的真正需求，而不是他们自己为了自己的幸福所想给予的。</p>
<p>He is at this threshold now of calling out individuals around the world, for this is a Teaching for the whole world and not merely for one tribe, one nation, one region or one group. And timing is critically important because the Message is given for the world now. It is not something to be merely studied in a casual manner, or considered over time, or disputed and debated in the halls of academia, where Knowledge is so very rare.</p>
<p>他现在正处在召唤全世界个人的关键时刻，因为这是为整个世界而来的教导，而不仅仅是为某个部落、国家、地区或群体。时机至关重要，因为这个启示是为当下的世界而赐予的。这不是一件可以随意学习、长时间考虑，或在学术殿堂中争论辩论的事情，内识在这些地方都是非常罕见的。</p>
<p>This is an urgent Message for humanity. The time is now. The need is overarching and growing with each passing day. Humanity cannot see or know what it must do. Not enough people have the conviction of heart to do what is really necessary. They must be reached by the Revelation. They can remain as Christians and Buddhists and Muslims, but they must be reached by the Revelation—enough people in the world.</p>
<p>这是给人类的紧急讯息。时不我待。需求是巨大的，而且与日俱增。人类看不到也不知道自己必须做什么。没有足够的人有足够的信念去做真正必要的事情。他们必须收到启示。他们可以保持基督徒、佛教徒和穆斯林的身份，但必须有足够多的人能够被启示所触及。</p>
<p>So the Messenger is under tremendous pressure to do this with very limited resources and support. He is always dealing with uncertainty, you see, and a great challenge. He cannot live a life of repose. He cannot lose himself in meditation for long periods of time. For he is called to a great service in the world, whose needs are profound and growing every day. And he is the one who has God’s answer.</p>
<p>因此，信使在资源和支持都非常有限的情况下，承担着巨大的压力。你看，他总是在应对不确定性和巨大的挑战。他不能过安逸的生活。他不能长时间沉浸在冥想中。因为他被召唤为这个世界提供伟大的服务，这个世界的需求是巨大的，而且与日俱增。而他就是那个拥有上帝答案的人。</p>
<p>This is where his strength, his patience and his determination really are needed and required, or he would break down and fall apart. He would give himself to some wild and inappropriate avenue to seek, or be seduced by others who would want to use him and his Revelation for their own self-importance and ideas.</p>
<p>在这个时候，他的力量、耐心和决心才真正变得至关重要，否则他将会崩溃和瓦解。他会把自己投入到一些疯狂和不恰当的探索之路，或者被那些想利用他和他的启示来满足自我重要性和想法的人所诱惑。</p>
<p>No one understands the life of the Messenger. But We give these things to you so that you may begin to have an appreciation for who this individual is and what they have had to do and the long journey they have had to take. You who are impatient for everything cannot imagine the patience this has required and the forbearance it has required and the strength and responsibility it has required.</p>
<p>没有人理解信使的生活。但我们告诉你这些，以便你开始理解这个人是谁，他们必须做些什么，以及他们所经历的漫长旅程。对一切都不耐烦的你无法想象这需要多大的耐心，需要多大的忍耐，需要多大的力量和责任。</p>
<p>God wants you to understand the process of Revelation. God wants you to understand the life of the Messenger, if you can. God wants you to feel this with your heart and not merely discern it with your ideas.</p>
<p>上帝希望你理解启示的过程。如果可以的话，上帝希望你理解信使的生活。上帝希望你用心去感受，而不仅仅是用想法去辨别。</p>
<p>God wants you to know the importance of the Revelation and what it has taken to bring it into the world, for the Messenger and for those who have abided with him and journeyed with him for so very long, during the long periods where he would have to remain in obscurity—preparing, building, studying.</p>
<p>上帝希望你知道启示的重要性，以及将启示带入世界所付出的努力，包括信使和那些长期与他同行的人，在他必须保持隐匿的漫长时期中——进行准备、进行构建、进行学习。</p>
<p>These are the saints of the Revelation, not because they were so glowingly magnificent, but because of what they were able to do, and the fidelity that they demonstrated, and the courage and commitment that moved their lives.</p>
<p>这些都是启示中的圣者，并不是因为他们光辉灿烂，而是因为他们所能做的事情，以及他们所展示的忠诚、勇气和承诺，推动了他们的生命。</p>
<p>See this in contrast to everyone and everything around you, and you will begin to see the power and the meaning of this for your life. For you too have a greater destiny and purpose and can learn from the life of the Messenger. But you are not called to do what he is called to do. You were not sent into the world to do what he was sent into the world to do, but to assist him and others in simple and humble ways but with a great spirit, the great strength and patience that the Messenger has demonstrated so far.</p>
<p>将这一点与你周围的一切对比，你将开始看到这对你的生命所具有的力量和意义。因为你也有一个更伟大的天命和目的，可以从信使的生活中学习。但你不是被召唤去做他所做的事情。你并不是被送到这个世界上去做他被送到这里要做的事情，而是以简单而谦逊的方式，带着伟大的精神、伟大的力量和耐心，来协助他和其他人，这些正是信使迄今为止所展示的。</p>
<p>Heaven looks upon him with great appreciation, but also with great need. Heaven looks upon his wife and his son as key to his success. Heaven looks upon those called to the Revelation with great intention, for they are important now, more important than they even know or realize.</p>
<p>天国对他充满了极大的欣赏，也充满了极大的期待。天国将他的妻子和儿子视为他成功的关键。天国对那些被召唤接收启示的人怀有深远的意图，因为他们现在至关重要，比他们自己所知道的或意识到的还要重要。</p>
<p>It is the Will of Heaven that God’s Message be given to the world in a timely manner, to prepare enough people to face the great change that is coming to the world and humanity’s encounter with life in the universe, a reality that no one in the world understands today.</p>
<p>天国的意志就是要及时将上帝的讯息传递给世人，让足够多的人做好准备，面对即将到来的世界巨变，面对人类与宇宙生命的相遇，面对当今世界无人理解的现实。</p>
<p>That is why God has revealed as part of the Revelation the reality and spirituality of life in the universe. God has revealed the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world so that people may be alerted and informed and given this greater perspective, which will bring greater clarity, purpose and meaning to their lives and activities.</p>
<p>正因如此，上帝将宇宙生命的现实和精神性作为启示的一部分予以揭示。上帝揭示了即将降临世界的变革巨浪，以便人们可以得到警示和信息，获得这种更大的视角，从而为他们的生命和活动带来更大的清晰度、目的和意义。</p>
<p>God does not prepare you for Heaven alone. God prepares you to deal with the real world and the New World that is coming that very few people in the world can yet see.</p>
<p>上帝不仅仅让你为天国做好准备。上帝还为你准备的是应对现实世界和即将到来的新世界，而这个世界上还只有极少数人能看到这个新的世界。</p>
<p>You too must have the humility to receive the Revelation. You must have the strength and perseverance to take the Steps to Knowledge. You must have the courage to live with questions that cannot yet be answered. You too must live the calling that extends far beyond your intellect and your understanding. You too must build the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work and Providership, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development—all the things the Messenger has had to do and has been doing for so long.</p>
<p>你也必须谦逊地接收启示。必须有力量和毅力来走向内识的阶梯。你必须有勇气带着尚无答案的问题生活。你也必须生活在远远超越你的智力和理解力的召唤之中。你也必须建立自己生活的四大支柱——关系支柱、工作与供养支柱、健康支柱和精神发展支柱——所有这些都是信使不得不做并且长期以来一直在做的事情。</p>
<p>You will understand his life more completely as you take the journey yourself and see how really challenging it is, and how immensely rewarding it is, and how confounding it may be to your understanding and to your ideas of yourself. For its purpose is to take you beyond these things into a greater life, a greater service and a greater purpose in the world.</p>
<p>当你亲身经历这段旅程时，你会更全面地理解他的生活，看到它是多么具有挑战性，多么令人受益匪浅，以及它对你的理解和你对自己的看法是多么令人困惑。因为它的目的是带你超越这些生活，在这个世界上进入更伟大的生命、更伟大的服务以及更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>The Messenger is in the world now. He is an older man. It would be a great honor and blessing for you to meet him during his life and to learn of him and to hold in your heart his demonstration and to receive his gift of Revelation, which will give you the life you have always sought in other things.</p>
<p>信使现在就在这个世界上。他是一位年长者。如果你能在他有生之年见到他，学习他，将他的示范铭记于心，并收到他的启示礼物，这将是你莫大的荣幸和祝福。它将给你带来你一直在其他事物中寻求的生命。</p>
<p>Heaven blesses him and blesses all who can receive of him. He is a humble man. But in Heaven he is known, and he stands with those great Messengers who have blessed and guided humanity in the past.</p>
<p>天国祝福他，也祝福所有能够从他这里收到启示的人。他是一位谦逊的人，但在天国，他是被知道的，他与那些在过去祝福和引导人类的伟大信使站在一起。</p>
