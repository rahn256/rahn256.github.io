<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on June 4, 2008 in Boulder, CO<br>2008年6月4日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In preparing for the Great Waves and in preparing for the Greater Community, you are preparing for your true purpose and greater mission in life. These are not merely inconveniences. These are the opportunities that you have been waiting for. For under normal circumstances, you will never find your greater purpose and mission in life. Something extraordinary must happen to call them forth from you, to create a situation where they will be needed and called for.</p>
<p>在为变革的巨浪和大社区做准备时，你实际上是在为你真实的目的和更大的人生使命做准备。这些不仅仅是不便之事。这些也是你一直在等待的机会。因为在正常情况下，你永远不会找到你更大的生命目的和使命。必须有非同寻常的事情发生，才能把它们从你身上召唤出来，创造出一种需要它们、召唤它们的情况。</p>
<p>You cannot initiate yourself here. There must be greater forces at work, both on the physical plane and in the spiritual reality as well. So it is no accident that you have been confronted with the reality of the Great Waves of change, while others remain indifferent or ignorant regarding this. It is no accident that you have come to find this small part of the New Message for humanity, for it was arranged to be this way. You have come here as an act of destiny. This is a time of destiny.</p>
<p>在这里你无法自我启发。必须有更大的力量在起作用，不仅在物质层面，也在精神的现实中。因此，你面临变革巨浪的现实，而其他人对此漠不关心或一无无知，这并不是偶然。你能找到人类新讯息中的这一小部分，绝非偶然，因为它就是这样安排的。你来到这里是一种天命的安排。这是一个天命的时刻。</p>
<p>People may look upon the Great Waves with horror or with denial, with all kinds of human reactions. They cannot see that what they are really facing is the one thing that will redeem them and give them a greater life, a greater purpose and a greater contribution.</p>
<p>人们可能会以恐惧或否认的态度看待变革的巨浪，伴随着各种人类的反应。他们看不到他们真正面对的是一件能救赎他们的事件，给他们一个更大的生命，一个更大的目的和一个更大的贡献。</p>
<p>It can take a long time to wait for the great events to call forth this greater purpose from you, and in the interim you will be attracted to establish your own purposes, to give yourself your own greater purpose, to give yourself to things that please you or excite you or inspire you. In the interim, you may become married. You may have a family. You may fill your life with people, responsibilities, obligations and so forth. But when the great opportunity comes, it is still your time of calling. If your life is encumbered, if you are being held back by people, responsibilities and obligations, then it is more difficult to respond. But the timing and the response are still fundamental.</p>
<p>等待伟大的事件唤起你内心更大的目的可能需要很长时间，而在此期间，你可能会被吸引去设定自己的目标，赋予自己更伟大的目标，投入那些让你愉悦、兴奋或激励你的事物。在此期间，你可能会结婚，组建家庭，你可能会充实你的生活，包括人际关系、责任、义务等。然而，当伟大的机会来临时，这仍然是你的召唤时刻。如果你的生命受到束缚，如果你被人际关系、责任和义务束缚，那么回应会更加困难。但时机和回应仍然是根本的。</p>
<p>It is no accident that you are now called to learn about life in the Greater Community, to be amongst the few who can receive this Revelation. You did not simply stumble upon it by accident. There is a purpose behind this, you see. This represents the great mystery of your life—that while you live your life at the surface, there are deeper forces at work beneath that surface.</p>
<p>你现在被召唤去学习大社区中的生命，并成为少数能够接受这个启示的人，这并非偶然。你并不是偶然发现它的。在这背后有一个目的。这代表了你生命中的伟大神秘——当你在生命的表面生活时，表面之下有更深层的力量在起作用。</p>
<p>At the surface, life looks chaotic and unpredictable. It looks mundane. There is nothing really extraordinary about it. It is full of stimulation, some of which gives pleasure and much of which gives pain. But deeper down, there are deeper currents moving your life, moving you into proximity to learn something, to see something, to respond to something—both within yourself and within the world at large. It is like the ocean, which is turbulent at the surface—swept by the winds of the world, moved by trivial forces. But at its depths, the ocean is being governed by greater forces, by planetary forces, by immense and mysterious forces that are moving water from one part of the Earth to another.</p>
<p>在表面上，生活看起来混乱且不可预测。它看起来很平凡，没有什么真正非凡的事情。它充满了刺激，有些带来快乐，有些带来痛苦。但在更深的层面上，有更深的力量在推动你的生命，推动你去学习某些东西，去看见某些东西，去回应某些东西——无论是在你自己的内在，还是在整个世界中。这就像海洋，表面波涛汹涌，被世界的风浪吹动，被琐碎的力量所推动。但在深处，海洋受到更大的力量支配，受到行星的力量、巨大的和神秘的力量的推动，这些力量将水域从地球的一个地方推动到另一个地方。</p>
<p>Your life is like that. At the surface, it is calm, it is turbulent, it changes from day to day, but it gives no real indication of its real movement and real purpose. From the surface of the ocean, how can you determine what the great movement of the waters really is? You cannot. You would need to have a greater wisdom, a greater insight of Knowledge here to really comprehend the fact that the water of the Earth is moving in a conveyor-like manner from one part of the globe to another—something you could not see or understand from the surface.</p>
<p>你的生活也是如此。在表面上，它有时平静，有时动荡，它每天都在变化，但它并没有真正揭示它真正的动向和目的。从海洋的表面上，你如何确定水域的真正流动方向呢？你无法做到。你需要有更大的智慧和洞察力，才能真正理解地球上的水域流像传送带一样从地球的一部分移动到另一部分——这是你在表面上无法看到或理解的。</p>
<p>Your life has greater forces within you—forces that are stimulated by powers within the world and beyond the world, within the physical reality and beyond the physical reality. You have a purpose here, and it is related to the time in which you live and the events to come.</p>
<p>你的生命中拥有更大的力量——这种力量受到世界内外的力量的刺激，存在于物理现实和物理现实之外。你在这里有一个目的，它与你所生活的时代和即将到来的事件有关。</p>
<p>If everyone left it up to themselves to design a higher purpose, you would have a world full of musicians, poets, gardeners, therapists and so forth. It would be extremely passive. It would not be vital at all. It would not have any meaning.</p>
<p>如果每个人都由自己来设计一个更高宗旨，你会有一个充满音乐家、诗人、园艺家、治疗师等等的世界。这将是极其被动的。它根本就没有生命力。它也不会有任何意义。</p>
<p>So your greater purpose is really beyond these things. It is only the rare and exceptional person who is destined to become a great artist or musician, or a great athlete or an expert in a particular field. And these things are revealed to them as they go along. But for most people, the mystery remains, and from the surface of their lives, they cannot discern it—its meaning, its purpose or its direction.</p>
<p>所以，你的更大目的实际上超越了这些事情。只有极少数和特殊的人注定成为伟大的艺术家或音乐家，或伟大的运动员或某个领域的专家。这些目的在他们前行的过程中被揭示出来。但对于大多数人来说，这个神秘仍然存在，从他们生活的表面看，他们无法辨别它——它的意义、它的目的或它的方向。</p>
<p>You view yourself as a weak person, trying to survive, trying to be happy, trying to have good things and avoid bad things, trying to have relief, trying to have pleasures, trying to have opportunities. But at a deeper level, you were sent here on a mission, and nothing will satisfy that mission except the mission itself. And what will stimulate that mission within you are great events in the world and the needs of others that call it forth from you. They generate the initiation.</p>
<p>你把自己看作是一个软弱的人，试图生存，试图快乐，试图拥有美好的事物，避免糟糕的事情，寻求安慰，享受快乐，寻找机会。但在更深的层面上，你是带着使命来到这里的，除了使命它本身，没有什么能满足这个使命。而将激发你内心使命的是世界上的重大事件和他人的需求，它们从你内心唤起这个使命。它们产生了启动。</p>
<p>The need will grow in the world. The human family will come under greater duress. The calling will sound forth for many people to awaken from their sleep and their dreams of self-fulfillment—called into action and with it a deeper memory and sense of responsibility to the world.</p>
<p>这种需求将在世界中增长。人类家庭将面临更大的压力。呼唤声将响起，让许多人从他们的沉睡和自我满足的梦境中醒来——被召唤起来行动，并带着对世界的更深层记忆和责任感。</p>
<p>From the surface, you cannot see this. It sounds fantastic. Perhaps it sounds good to you. Perhaps it does not. But you cannot see it from the surface, for it represents the mystery, the mystery of your life. Everything you do to try to be happy and to satisfy yourself, everything that you do that costs you so much in terms of time and energy and life force, cannot satisfy this deeper need—the need of the soul to discover your greater calling in life, to respond to it, to prepare for it, to be initiated into it and to serve it in the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>从表面上看，你无法看到这一点。这听起来令人难以置信。也许这对你来说听起来不错，也许不然。但你无法从表面上看到它，因为它代表了你生命的神秘。你所做的一切尝试来使自己快乐和满足的努力，以及你为此付出的时间、精力和生命力，都无法满足这个更深层面的需求——灵魂需要发现你生命中的更大使命，回应它，为之做准备，被引导进入其中，并在你生活变化的环境中为之服务。</p>
<p>Precisely when and how things will take place remain part of the mystery, for there are so many things that can change the opportunities or the timing of things. That is why making predictions is counterproductive. The future is always changing and shifting, and the outcome can take many appearances. But the direction is clear.</p>
<p>事情发生的确切时间和方式仍然是神秘的一部分，因为有太多的事情可以改变事情发生的机会或时机。这就是为什么预测会适得其反。未来总是在不断变化和转变，结果可能会有多种表象。但方向是明确的。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are not learning about the Great Waves of change just to try to run away somewhere and be safe. You are not having this being revealed to you simply so that you can fortify yourself. It really represents a greater calling. The different levels and kinds of service are countless. You do not yet know. You can only go towards something that calls to you, that is genuine. You must leave the definitions open. Do not come to conclusions. Do not proclaim a role or a title for yourself. That is always premature and is foolish.</p>
<p>因此，你学习关于变革的巨浪并不是为了逃到某个地方去安全。你并不是因为这些揭示给你而仅仅是为了增强自我防护。这实际上代表了一种更大的召唤。服务的不同层级和种类是无数的。你还不知道。你只能朝向召唤你的、真实的内识。你必须保持定义的开放。不要得出结论。不要为自己宣称角色或头衔。这总是为时过早且愚蠢的。</p>
<p>The Great Waves will show you where you must go, how you must be, whom you must meet and how you must learn to respond to life. They will show you how to mature and how to become one person with one reference point within yourself, with one great focus and orientation, instead of a diffracted personality with many voices, with many directions, with all kinds of conflicts and opposition within yourself. You will never know your deeper nature by studying your personality or your personal history. It must be revealed to you through a greater experience and a greater involvement in the world.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪会向你展示你必须去的地方、你必须成为的样子、你必须遇见的人以及你必须学习如何回应生命。它们会向你展示如何成熟，如何成为一个有着内在唯一参照点、专注且有方向的完整的人，而不是一个充满众多声音、方向不明、内心充满各种冲突和对立的分裂人格。你永远无法通过研究你的个性或个人历史来知道你更深层面的自然性。它必须通过更大的经历和对世界更深入的参与来揭示给你。</p>
<p>Therefore, the correct and best approach is to put yourself in the position of being a learner, being a student—not making assumptions, not making proclamations, not living in definitions, but leaving the way open, leaving your life unexplained, allowing the mystery to call you and guide you forth.</p>
<p>因此，正确且最佳的方法是把自己置于一个学习者的位置，成为一名学生——不做假设，不做宣告，不生活在定义中，而是留出道路，让你的生命不被解释，允许神秘召唤你并引导你前进。</p>
<p>For amidst all of the changing circumstances of your life now and the great changes that are to come to the world, there is still the mystery, and the mystery is what will give you clarity and direction. This is the realm where Knowledge exists. This is the realm where your Spiritual Family can communicate to you. This is where you can receive guidance. This is where you can do things that other people would never do, see things that people would never see and hear things that people would never hear—things that are important for your life and for the well-being of others.</p>
<p>因为在你现在生活的所有变化环境中，以及即将到来的世界的巨大变化中，依然存在着奥秘，而奥秘将为你提供清晰和方向。这里是知识存在的领域。这是你的精神家庭可以与你交流的领域。这是你可以得到指导的地方。在这里，你可以做别人永远不会做的事情，看到别人永远不会看到的关系，听到别人永远不会听到的声音——这些对你的生命和他人的福祉至关重要。</p>
<p>Therefore, as you proceed, you must take time for stillness and inner listening. Stillness is learning how to still the mind and to focus the mind so that you can see beyond your thoughts and hear beyond your thoughts—hear what is there, see what is there and develop the ability to become objective and look with clarity, without preference or fear.</p>
<p>因此，当你继续前进时，你必须花时间静心聆听。静心是学习如何使心灵平静并集中注意力，以便你能够超越自己的感想去看见和听见那里发生的事情，发展成为客观的能力，清晰地观察，不带偏见或恐惧。</p>
<p>For most people, this skill is beyond their reach. But you must cultivate it. You cultivate it by carrying out important tasks, and you cultivate it by building a connection to Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>对于大多数人来说，这项技能是难以企及的。但你必须培养它。你通过执行重要任务来培养它，也通过建立与内在内识的联系来培养它。</p>
<p>In taking the steps to Knowledge, you learn how to still the mind, how to listen within yourself and how to discern the voice and the movement of Knowledge from all the other voices in your mind—the voice of your parents, the voice of your teachers, the voice of your culture, the voice of your friends, the voice of your fear, the voice of your desire, the voice of your self-doubt, the voice of your self-criticism—all these other voices that reside within you. And then there is Knowledge.</p>
<p>在走向内识的过程中，你学习如何使心灵平静，如何内在聆听，如何从你内心的其他声音中分辨出内识的声音和动向——包括你父母的声音、老师的声音、文化的声音、朋友的声音、恐惧的声音、欲望的声音、自我怀疑的声音、自我批评的声音——所有这些在你内心存在的声音。然后还有内识。</p>
<p>The only way you can have confidence that what you are hearing and feeling is true is by building this connection and learning to discern the presence of Knowledge and the movement of Knowledge from all the other compulsions, all the other fantasies and ideas in your mind. Steps to Knowledge will teach you how to do this, and it will give you a great advantage.</p>
<p>你唯一能够确信你所听到和感受到的是真实的方式是通过建立这种联系，并学会从内心的其他冲动、幻想和想法中分辨出内识的存在和运动。通过内识的进阶将教你如何做到这一点，并为你提供巨大的优势。</p>
<p>Because you are entering very uncertain times, it is important that you learn to live without self-definitions, without trying to control events and without trying to live in conclusions. Here it will be necessary to live with the questions—the problems for which you do not have a solution and situations where you will have to work with a problem to learn how to resolve it, to learn how to meet its needs and so forth.</p>
<p>因为你正进入非常不确定的时代，所以你要学会不靠自我定义生活，不试图控制事件，不试图生活在结论中。在这里，有必要带着问题生活——那些你没有解决方案的问题，以及你必须与问题一起工作，学习如何解决它，学习如何满足它的需求等等的情况。</p>
<p>You will have to leave part of your life open and mysterious. The people who cannot do this will not fare well in the face of the Great Waves of change. They will not see, they will not know and they will not prepare. When change comes upon them, they will panic and be enraged and terrified.</p>
<p>你必须让你的部分生活保持开放和神秘。那些无法做到这一点的人在面对变革的巨浪时不会有好的表现。他们不会看见，不会知道，也不会准备。当变化降临时，他们会惊慌失措，被激怒，被吓坏。</p>
<p>If you are going to enter uncertain times, you must have this opening within yourself, this ability to listen, not for answers or explanations, but to listen to cultivate the ability to be inner-directed so when the moment comes when Knowledge must speak to you, you will be able to respond, and you will be able to feel the movement of that message moving you.</p>
<p>如果你要进入不确定的时代，你必须在自己内心有这种开放性，这种倾听的能力，不是为了答案或解释，而是倾听以培养内在指引的能力，当内识必须对你说话的时刻到来时，你会能够回应，你会感受到这个讯息推动你的动向。</p>
<p>You practice stillness not to get anything, but to learn to be still. You learn to be still so that you can feel and listen. You listen to develop the ability to listen so that when you are out in life, Knowledge within you can speak to you, guide you and hold you back when that is necessary.</p>
<p>你练习静心不是为了获得什么，而是为了学习如何保持静止。你学会静止以便感受和倾听。你倾听是为了培养倾听的能力，这样当你在生活中时，你内在的内识可以对你说话，指导你，并在必要时阻止你。</p>
<p>You will be dealing with very difficult circumstances and seeing great tribulation in the world as time goes on. How will you maintain your bearings? How will you keep yourself from entering into fear and panic, dread and apprehension? How will you prevent yourself from falling prey to the admonitions and the condemnations of others, which will arise all around you? How will you keep yourself from losing heart, from giving up, from feeling hopeless and defeated? When the rain is falling and the thunder is clashing, how will you be able to maintain clarity of mind and purpose?</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，你将面对非常困难的情况，并在世界上看到巨大的苦难。你如何保持你的方向？你如何避免陷入恐惧和恐慌，忧虑和不安？你如何防止自己成为他人指责和谴责的牺牲品，这些指责和谴责将会在你周围出现？你如何保持不失去信心，不放弃，不感到无望和失败？当大雨倾盆而下，雷声轰鸣时，你如何保持清晰的心灵和目的？</p>
<p>These are all important questions for you now. They require a deeper connection to Knowledge and an openness about your life and about the future. You do not know what is going to happen. You do not know how it is going to turn out. You do not know necessarily who will do well and who will not. You cannot predict it, for you are entering times of great change and uncertainty. How will you know? You will have to be open and listen.</p>
<p>这些问题对你来说现在都非常重要。它们需要你与内在的内识建立更深的联系，对你的生命和未来持开放态度。你不知道将会发生什么，你不知道事情将如何发展，你不一定知道谁会做得好，谁会做得不好。你无法预测，因为你正进入一个巨大的变化和不确定的时代。你将如何知道？你将不得不开放和倾听。</p>
<p>That is why the “Recommendations for Living in a Great Waves World” are really only beginning guidelines because everyone’s circumstances will be somewhat different, and everyone has a unique mission and purpose in life to discover and to fulfill. So beyond establishing initial steps and building a basic foundation, you will have to rely upon Knowledge within yourself and Knowledge within others to navigate the changing and uncertain times ahead.</p>
<p>这就是为什么“生活在变革巨浪世界的建议”实际上只是初步的指导，因为每个人的情况会有所不同，每个人都有一个独特的使命和目的需要发现和完成。因此，除了建立初步的步骤和基本的基础之外，你还必须依靠你内在的内识和他人内在的内识来应对未来变化和不确定的时代。</p>
<p>What you are being given here is essential for your success. This is planting seeds of Knowledge and wisdom in you, but you must prepare. You must learn The Way of Knowledge. You must study the Great Waves. You must reevaluate your life—your relationships, your activities, your obligations and everything—and carry out the deep evaluation. You will have to be strong when others are weak. You will have to have faith when others have no faith. You will have to be compassionate in the face of tragedy.</p>
<p>这里给你的讯息对你的成功至关重要。这是在你内心种植内识和智慧的种子，但你必须做好准备。你必须学习内识之路。你必须研究变革的巨浪。你必须重新评估你的生活——你的关系、活动、义务和一切，并进行深入的评估。在他人软弱时你必须坚强。在他人失去信心时你必须有信心。在面对悲剧时你必须富有同情心。</p>
<p>You cannot lose yourself now. Before, being true to yourself was an advantage, but not a necessity. Here it will be both. You must learn to look without preference and without fear, with a clear mind and have this inner strength, this faith in Knowledge, this connection to God, this connection to the mystery—without making false assumptions, without believing that everything will turn out, without thinking you will be protected in all instances, for this is not the case.</p>
<p>你现在不能迷失自己。以前，忠于自己是一种优势，但不是必要的。在这里，这将是两者兼备的。你必须学会无偏见和无恐惧地观察，保持清晰的心灵，拥有这种内在的力量，这种对内识的信仰，这种与上帝的联系，这种与神秘的联系——没有错误的假设，没有相信一切都会好转，没有认为在所有情况下你都会受到保护，因为情况并非如此。</p>
<p>That is why your inner preparation here is more significant than anything you do on the outside, for whatever you do on the outside is a temporary expedient. You cannot store food for the rest of your life. You cannot protect yourself from every event and eventuality. You cannot stockpile for decades. And there will be no place on Earth that will be entirely safe or beyond the reach of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>因此，你的内在准备比你在外部所做的一切都更重要，因为你在外部所做的一切都是暂时的权宜之计。你不能为你的余生储存食物，你不能保护自己免受每一个事件和意外的影响，你不能储存几十年的物资。而且地球上将没有任何地方是完全安全的，也没有任何地方是变革的巨浪所不能及的。</p>
<p>So you will have to become clear and resourceful, wise and inner-directed, for there will be very few on the outside who will be able to give you wise counsel. You will have to take care of your family and perhaps other people as well. You will have to take care of your health—your mental health and your physical health—and at times you will have to do things that are very courageous.</p>
<p>因此，你必须变得清晰和足智多谋，变得明智和内在指引，因为外界很少有人能给你提供明智的建议。你必须照顾好你的家人，也许还有其他人。你必须照顾好自己的健康——你的心理健康和身体健康，有时你还必须做一些非常勇敢的事情。</p>
<p>The more you value your strength and identify with it, the more you will build confidence in the face of uncertainty. Even in the face of disaster, you will have an inner confidence, and it will not be a false confidence. It will not be something you simply tell yourself to placate yourself or to make yourself feel better. It is the power of Knowledge. That is your core strength, but it is mysterious. You cannot control it. You cannot make it give you what you want. You cannot use it as a resource. For you must serve it. Your mind is meant to serve Spirit, as your body is meant to serve your mind. You cannot use Spirit as a resource.</p>
<p>你越是重视你的力量并与之认同，你就越能在面对不确定性时建立信心。即使在灾难面前，你也会有一种内在的自信，而这不会是一种虚假的自信。它不会是你为了安抚自己或让自己感觉更好而简单告诉自己的东西。它是内识的力量。这是你的核心力量，但它是神秘的。你无法控制它。你无法让它给你自己想要的东西，你不能把它当作资源来使用。因为你必须为它服务。你的心灵是为了服务精神而存在的，就像你的身体是为了服务你的心灵而存在的。你不能把精神当作资源来使用。</p>
<p>Your confidence must be established at a deeper level. The sense of authority in your life must be established beyond your personality and your ideas, for so many of your ideas will be challenged and will prove to be inadequate to face the future and to navigate the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>你的信心必须建立在更深的层面上。你生命中的权威感必须建立在你的个性和想法之外，因为你的许多想法将受到挑战，并且在面对未来和应对前方的困难时期时显得不足。</p>
<p>That is why you must become a student of Knowledge, as well as a student of the world. You will need to suspend many of your ideas and beliefs about people and about the world. Many of your assumptions that you find to be self-comforting now will only weaken you and make it more difficult for you to see what you need to know and to do.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须成为内识的学生，同时也是世界的学生。你需要暂停许多关于人和世界的想法和信念。许多现在让你感到安慰的假设只会削弱你，使你更难看到你需要知道和做的事情。</p>
<p>You do not know how it is going to turn out. But how it is going to turn out really does not matter because you are here to serve the world, and you serve the world without requiring a result. If your service is pure, if it comes from love and compassion, you give because you must give, not because you are assured of an outcome. You do it anyway. You try to bring about a good result, but in the end, you cannot control it. Then if your service to others seems to fail, you will not feel devastated. You did what you could. Like the physician in the field of battle taking care of the wounded soldiers, you do what you can with what you have.</p>
<p>你不知道事情会如何发展。但如何发展并不重要，因为你在这里是为了服务世界，你为世界服务而不需要一个结果。如果你的服务是纯粹的，如果它来自于爱和同情，你给予是因为你必须给予，而不是因为你确信会有一个结果。你无论如何都会去做。你试图带来一个好的结果，但最终你无法控制它。然后，如果你对他人的服务似乎失败了，你也不会感到沮丧。你尽了你所能。就像战场上的医生照顾受伤的士兵一样，你用你拥有的资源做你力所能及的事。</p>
<p>You are here to serve, not to control. You are here to give, not to manipulate things to your own advantage. This gives you a kind of immunity from the effects of tragedy, which in some cases may be extremely disheartening. Other people around you will fail. They will fail to prepare. They will fail to see and know. They will fail to maintain their stability. Some will even lose their lives. You cannot fail. This is the confidence you must have, and it must be built upon Knowledge and not upon some false sense of yourself.</p>
<p>你在这里是为了服务，而不是控制。你在这里是为了给予，而不是为了操纵事物以图利己。这赋予你一种免疫力，不受悲剧的影响，有时这种影响可能会极其令人沮丧。你周围的其他人可能会失败。他们可能会失败于无法准备，他们可能会失败于无法看见和知道，他们可能会失败于无法保持稳定。有些人甚至会失去生命。而你不能失败。这是你必须拥有的信心，它必须建立在内识之上，而不是建立在对自己的一种虚假的感觉之上。</p>
<p>Those who will be able to navigate the highly uncertain times ahead must have this strength and inner guidance. If they are to benefit from these circumstances, if they are to be uplifted and strengthened by these challenges, that must be their focus.</p>
<p>这就是为什么在面临高度不确定的未来时，拥有这种内在的力量和指导是至关重要的。如果人们要从这些环境中受益，如果他们要从这些挑战中得到提升和加强，这必须成为他们的重点。</p>
<p>From a personal point of view, it seems to be too much. The requirements are too great. The problems are too immense. The outcome is too tragic. From a personal perspective, you might as well just give up and go hide somewhere and hope that it all passes over, like a bad dream. You can wake up, and life can go on as you have known it. From a personal perspective, the Great Waves seem too radical, too extreme, impossible, improbable, illogical or unreasonable.</p>
<p>从个人的角度来看，这似乎显得太多。要求太大，问题太过严重，结果太过悲惨。从个人的角度来看，你可能会想要放弃，去某个地方躲藏，希望这一切像一个噩梦一样过去。你可以醒来，生活可以像以前一样继续。从个人的角度来看，变革的巨浪似乎过于激烈、极端、不可能、不合理或不合逻辑。</p>
<p>A New Message from God seems impossible and unreasonable. Even if you thought it was possible, you would think it would be something else, something lovely and beautiful, something sweet and assuring—nothing that requires you to deal with difficulties or to serve people under difficult circumstances. It should be something that would make you feel wonderful and carry you away in a blissful state.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息似乎是不可能的以及不合理的。即使你认为这是可能的，你也会认为它应该是其他的信息，应该是一些美丽的、甜蜜的、令人安慰的信息——而不是要求你在困难的情况下处理困难或为他人服务的讯息。它应该是让你感到美好并带你进入一种极乐状态的信息。</p>
<p>But here is the difference between fantasy and reality. This is a New Message from God. This is what it looks like before it is adulterated, corrupted and wed with other things by people and turned into a political tool or used by religious institutions to establish their power and their dominance.</p>
<p>在幻想和现实之间的区别就在于此。这是来自上帝的新讯息。这是它在未被人们掺杂、腐蚀或与其他事物结合之前的样子，是未被政治工具化或宗教机构用来建立其权力和主导地位之前的样子。</p>
<p>This is what a New Message looks like in its pure form. It is clear. It is powerful. It requires great things of people. And it gives great things to people. It has not been watered down to be acceptable to the masses. It has not been socialized so that it is socially acceptable. This is the real thing. You must be genuine in order to see it and to respond to it and to receive the power and the grace that it brings into your life.</p>
<p>这就是新讯息在其纯粹形式下的样子。它是清晰的，强大的。它对人们有很高的要求，同时也给予人们很大的益处。它没有被稀释，以便被大众所接受，它也没有被社会化，以便它被社会所接受。这就是真实的讯息。你必须是真诚的，才能看到它、对它作出回应，并接受它带入你生命的力量和恩典。</p>
<p>People will consider the Messenger and think he must be powerful and produce miracles. He must be able to be flawless—without sin, without stain, without error, loving and compassionate to everyone all the time. Yet the real Messenger is a human being—fallible, prone to error—and yet strong, committed and dedicated.</p>
<p>人们会考虑到信使，并认为他一定是强大的，能够创造奇迹。他必须是完美无缺的——没有罪恶，没有污点，没有错误，永远对所有人充满爱与同情。然而，真正的信使是一个人类存在——有错误的可能，容易犯错——但同时又是坚强、坚定不移和一心一意的。</p>
<p>Can you see the difference between fantasy and reality? If your life has been about building and sustaining fantasies, then the reality will escape you. You will still think in fantastic terms, and your expectations will reflect this.</p>
<p>你能看出幻想和现实之间的区别吗？如果你的一生都在构建和维持幻想，那么现实就会逃避你。你仍然会以幻想的方式思考问题，你的期望也会反映这一点。</p>
<p>You are hearing for the first time a New Message from God being presented into the world. You are reading it. It has never happened before. If you cannot receive it, if you do not believe it, if you think it is something else, then the reflection is upon you. To receive something pure, you must gain purity within yourself. It will not fit your expectations or the expectations of your culture and society.</p>
<p>你正首次听到一条来自上帝的新讯息被传递到世界上。你正在阅读它。这是前所未有的。如果你不能接收它，如果你不相信它，如果你认为它是别的东西，那反映的是你的问题。要接收纯粹的讯息，你必须在自己内心中获得纯洁。它不会符合你的期望或你的文化和社会的期望。</p>
<p>The real emissaries are never valued in their lifetime. Only after they have died and are no longer a social problem or a security problem, then they are deified. Then they are exalted. Then temples and monuments are built for them. But while they were alive, they were a problem, an irritant, upsetting, disconcerting, talking about things that people had difficulty understanding or facing within themselves, setting a higher standard for life and making everyone feel how pathetically compromised their situation really is.</p>
<p>真正的使者在他们的有生之年从未被重视。只有在他们去世后，不再是社会问题或安全问题时，他们才会被神化、崇拜。然后为他们建造庙宇和纪念碑。但在他们活着的时候，他们是个问题，是个烦人精，让人不安，谈论人们难以理解或面对的事情，设定更高的生命标准，让每个人都感受到自己处境的悲惨和妥协。</p>
<p>God has a higher regard for you than you have for yourself. Therefore, great things are given to you to do, to see and to know. If you are able to receive this and do this, you will escape your pathetic view of yourself and build a new foundation for relationship with yourself and with others as well.</p>
<p>上帝对你的期望比你对自己的期望更高。因此，伟大的事情被给予你去做、去看、去知道。如果你能够接受并做到这些，你将摆脱对自己的悲惨看法，为自己和他人建立新的关系基础。</p>
<p>The New Message brings with it a warning, a blessing and a preparation. If you do not recognize the warning, you will not understand the blessing. If you understand the warning and the blessing, you will see the need for the preparation. You will need a way, a method, a pathway to achieve and to gain the very things that are being presented here.</p>
<p>这个来自上帝的新讯息带来了警告、祝福和准备。如果你认识不到警告，你就无法理解祝福。如果你理解警告和祝福，你就会看到准备的必要性。你将需要一种方式、一种方法、一条途径来实现和获得这里所介绍的内容。</p>
<p>In the face of this, you will feel weak and confused. One day you will feel strong. The next day you will feel weak. One day you will feel that your life is blessed. The next day you will feel as if you have been deserted because that is the surface of your mind—one day calm, next day turbulent, sometimes viciously whipped up by the winds of the world, never stable. But as you learn to become connected to the power and the movement of Knowledge within yourself, this turbulence at the surface will have less and less influence over you and over your thinking and emotions. You will just see it as turbulence at the surface of your mind, and this will give you greater equanimity and objectivity.</p>
<p>面对这一切，你会感到自己的虚弱和迷茫。有一天你会觉得自己很强大。第二天你就会感觉到自己的虚弱。有一天你会觉得自己的生命是受到祝福的，第二天你就会觉得自己好像被遗弃了，因为这就是你心灵的表面——有时平静，有时动荡，有时被世界的风暴猛烈吹动，永远是不稳定的。但当你学会与自己内心的内识的力量和运动建立联系时，这种表面上的动荡对你的心灵和情感的影响就会越来越小。你会把它看作是心灵表面的动荡，这将给你带来更大的平静和客观性。</p>
<p>It is not expected that you will understand the warning completely because you must keep looking yourself. You must have the comprehension yourself. To simply hear it and believe it will not be enough to stimulate courageous action within you or to evoke wisdom within you.</p>
<p>我们并不指望你能完全理解这些警告，因为你必须自己不断寻找。你必须自己理解。仅仅听到它和相信它，不足以激发你内心的勇气，也不足以唤起你内心的智慧。</p>
<p>The blessing is that Knowledge is within you. It is here to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishments in life. It is here to enable you to find the individuals who will represent a higher purpose in your life. It means that God is with you, in you, connected to you, and that humanity has a greater promise within the world and within the Greater Community of worlds. That is the blessing. And you are destined to have relationships of higher purpose if you can respond to a greater calling in your life, if you can face the reality of your life, and if you can proceed forward step by step. That is the blessing.</p>
<p>祝福在于内识存在于你的内心。它在这里引导你，保护你，并引领你走向更伟大的成就。它将帮助你找到那些代表更高宗旨的个人。它意味着上帝与你同在，在你身上，与你相连，人类在这个世界以及在世界大社区中有着更大的承诺。这就是祝福。如果你能回应你生命中更大的召唤，面对你生命的现实，并一步一步前进，你注定会拥有更高宗旨的关系。这就是祝福。</p>
<p>Yet it requires a very different way of considering yourself, other people, the world, the future and the past. It requires a tremendous reevaluation, and this takes time. So you will not understand the warning completely. You will not understand the blessing completely. And you will not see the need for the preparation or understand how the preparation really works.</p>
<p>然而，这需要一种非常不同的方式来考虑你自己、其他人、世界、未来和过去。它需要一个巨大的重新评估，而这需要时间。因此，你不会完全理解警告，也不会完全理解祝福。而且你也不会看到准备的必要性，或理解准备如何真正发挥作用。</p>
<p>You could look at the study of Steps to Knowledge and think, “Oh, this is so easy! This is basic. This is for beginners.” Yet you have no idea what you are looking at, what a masterpiece that is and the power of Spirit that can work through you in relationship to it.</p>
<p>你可能会通过看内识进阶进行学习，并认为，“哦，这太简单了！这是基础的。这是给初学者的。”然而，你根本不知道自己在看什么，不知道这是多么伟大的杰作，也不知道精神的力量可以通过你工作。</p>
<p>Your mind does not know anything. Only Knowledge knows. Your personal mind has beliefs and convictions and fixed ideas, but it does not know anything. It was meant to serve Knowledge, not to replace Knowledge. That is why the true recognition happens at a deeper level. The true commitment arises from a deeper level. The true participation is motivated from a deeper level. The waters of the great oceans are moved at a deeper level.</p>
<p>你的心灵什么也不知道。只有内识知道。你的个人心智有信仰、信念和固定的观念，但它什么也不知道。它应该服务于内识，而不是取代内识。这就是为什么真实的认知发生在更深的层面。真实的承诺来自更深的层面。真实的参与是由更深的层面所激发的。海洋的水流在更深的层面上运动。</p>
<p>Therefore, you have an opportunity now to have your greater purpose revealed to you in the face of the Great Waves of change, in the face of the Greater Community and in the face of all the uncertainty and unanswerable questions that they present to you. This is the gift. This is the promise. This is the doorway through which you must now pass.</p>
<p>因此，你现在有一个机会，在面对变革的巨浪时，在面对大社区时，在面对他们向你提出的所有不确定性和无法回答的问题时，你有机会让你的更大目的得到显现。这就是礼物。这就是承诺。这就是你现在必须通过的大门。</p>
