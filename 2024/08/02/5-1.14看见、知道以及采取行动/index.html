<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on June 29, 2008 in Boulder, CO<br>2008年6月29日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be aware of a great need or a great event represents but the first threshold. To fulfill one’s awareness, one must take action. Action is necessary here to bring to fruition one’s awareness and to realize one’s strength.</p>
<p>察觉到一个重大的需求或一个重大的事件，只是第一个门槛。要真正实现这种觉知，必须采取行动。在这里，行动是必要的，以实现一个人的觉知和认识到一个人的力量。</p>
<p>There are people who are becoming aware of the Great Waves of change, but who are not taking action regarding them. As a result, they are losing their self-confidence and are not beginning their preparation. Depression, cynicism, ambivalence—these are all the result of not taking action around things that one recognizes to be important. The awareness was not fulfilled, and, as a result, it becomes dark. It becomes clouded, and the inspiration is lost.</p>
<p>有些人正在察觉到变革的巨浪，但没有对此采取行动。结果，他们失去了自信，也没有开始准备。抑郁、愤世嫉俗、矛盾心理——这些都是围绕着人们识别到重要的事情没有采取行动的结果。觉知没有得到满足，结果它变得黯淡，变得模糊，灵感也随之消失。</p>
<p>Action is necessary to fulfill what one is seeing and knowing. Action does not have to be immediate, however, for there should be a period of contemplation. There are, in fact, three stages in the process of seeing, knowing and acting.</p>
<p>采取行动是为了满足看见和知道的事情。然而，行动不必立即进行，因为应该有一段深思熟虑的时间。实际上，在看见、知道和行动的过程中有三个阶段。</p>
<p>There is seeing a sign. Something stimulates you. You recognize something must be done. There is a time to contemplate, a time of knowing what this is, feeling the need to take it into your mind and your heart. Then there is a time of action. The action itself may have many stages. It may be a very long process, in fact, and that is true within the context of the Great Waves of change. Even a specific change that must be undertaken in one’s life may have many steps involved. You may only know the first few, but it is necessary to move with Knowledge. Only then will you know if what you are seeing is true. Only then will you know its great importance for your life.</p>
<p>在这个过程中，有一个看见迹象的阶段。某些事情激发了你，你认识到必须做点什么。这时，你需要一段时间来深思熟虑，体会这个需求，将其带入你的心灵和内心。然后是采取行动的时候。行动本身可能会有许多阶段。事实上，在变革巨浪的背景下，这可能是一个非常漫长的过程。即使是生活中需要进行的具体改变，也可能涉及许多步骤。你可能只知道前几个步骤，但必须随内识一起行动。只有这样，你才能知道你所看见的是否真实，才能知道它对你生命的重要意义。</p>
<p>People want to have certainty before they act, but it is the action itself that creates the certainty. It is the courage to move and to change one’s thinking and one’s circumstances that creates the certainty. This is the confirmation. People want to have no doubts before they act. But it is the action itself, if it is true and appropriate, that relieves you from doubt at last.</p>
<p>人们希望在行动之前拥有确定性，但实际上，行动它本身就创造了确定性。正是勇敢地行动、改变思维和环境创造了确定性。这就是确认之路。人们希望在行动之前毫无疑虑，但如果行动是真实和适当的，那正是行动它本身最终消除了疑虑。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not in doubt, and if your connection to Knowledge is strong enough, it will carry you beyond the initial resistance, fear, doubt and endless evaluation. For there comes a time to act, and this represents a threshold within itself.</p>
<p>内识是不存在疑虑的，如果你与内识的联系足够强大，它会带你超越最初的阻力、恐惧、怀疑和无尽的评估。因为到了一定时候，必须行动，这本身就代表了一个门槛。</p>
<p>There are many, many people who have known things for a long time. They say to themselves, “I know I must give this up” or “I know I must change this” or “I know I must do this.” But they have not yet acted because Knowledge within them is not strong enough yet to overcome their initial resistance.</p>
<p>人们经常会知道到他们生活中需要改变的某些事情，比如说：“我知道我必须放弃这个”或者“我知道我必须做这个。”然而，采取行动可能会很困难。因为他们内心的内识还没有强大到足以克服他们最初的阻力。</p>
<p>It is a fact in human nature that people adapt to their circumstances. Even if the circumstances are very compromised, even if the circumstances are very bad, people adapt. This adaptation represents both a strength and a weakness. The fact that humanity can adapt to changing circumstances has given it its great strength and dominance within the world. But the reality that people adapt to situations that are unhealthy for them or that are not in their best interests represents the frailty of human awareness and the degree to which people can compromise themselves to their great detriment.</p>
<p>人性中的一个事实是，人们会适应他们的环境。即使环境非常不利，即使环境非常糟糕，人们也会适应。这种适应既代表了一种力量，也代表了一种软弱。人类能够适应不断变化的环境这一事实，使其在世界范围内拥有巨大的力量和主导地位。但是，人们适应那些对他们不健康或不符合他们最大利益的环境的现实，代表了人类觉知的脆弱，以及人们可以在多大程度上损害自己的利益。</p>
<p>That is why there is an initial resistance. People have adapted to something, and change is upsetting. It is costly. It is risky. Unless the situation is utterly terrible, people adapt and build their lives around a set of circumstances. To change requires a great force from within them. This involves inconvenience. It involves self-doubt. It involves living with questions that one cannot fully answer. It involves taking action and giving up privileges or seeming benefits at the outset. For most people adapt to situations that are unhealthy for them because there are certain benefits. Obviously, one must give up those benefits to change those circumstances. Yet this is a small price to pay to relieve oneself of an unhealthy and unhappy situation.</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们会有最初的抵触情绪。他们已经适应了一些事情，而改变使人感到不安。改变是有代价的，是有风险的。除非情况极其糟糕，否则人们会适应并围绕一系列环境构建他们的生活。要改变需要内心有巨大的力量。这涉及不便，涉及自我怀疑，涉及面对一些无法完全回答的问题。它涉及采取行动，并在一开始就放弃特权或表面上的利益。大多数人之所以适应对他们不健康的情况，是因为其中有某些利益。显然，要改变这些情况，人们必须放弃这些利益。然而，这只是一个小小的代价，就能摆脱不健康和不快乐的状况。</p>
<p>Therefore, there are three stages in knowing something: seeing, knowing and acting. The knowing aspect of this, the second part of this process, involves a deeper resonance and self-inquiry. One must ask, “Is this the truth? Must I take action regarding this?” You can even take a position against what you are seeing to see what kind of response occurs within you. You may test it in this way. You may challenge it. But in the end, if it is true, you will see there is a great certainty that action must be taken regarding that which you see and know.</p>
<p>因此，知道某事物的过程有三个阶段：看见、知道和行动。知道这一部分，也就是这个过程的第二部分，涉及更深层面的共鸣和自我探究。人们必须问自己，“这是事实吗？我是否必须对此采取行动？”你甚至可以对你看到的事物持反对立场，以观察自己内心会产生什么样的反应。你可以以这种方式测试它，可以挑战它。但最终，如果它是真实的，你会发现有一种强烈的确定性，必须对你所看到和知道的事情采取行动。</p>
<p>Once this is recognized, the sooner you take action, the better. Only in rare circumstances does waiting offer any benefit at all. Most people are far overdue in taking action regarding things that they have seen and known. They are afraid to face the discomfort, afraid to face the self-doubt and afraid to give up some small perceived benefit in order to change their attitude or behavior in a way that is utterly beneficial to them.</p>
<p>一旦认识到这一点，越早采取行动越好。只有在极少数情况下，等待才会带来任何益处。大多数人早就应该对他们所见所知的事情采取行动了。他们害怕面对不适，害怕面对自我怀疑，害怕为了改变态度或行为而放弃一些微小的表面利益，而这些改变对他们是完全有益的。</p>
<p>Clearly, it is not intelligent to pay a great price for a small pleasure, to make a great sacrifice for a very small reward. Clearly, that is not intelligent. But that is what people do. They make a great sacrifice for a very small reward. They compromise their lives for very, very small seeming advantages. They pay a great price for a very small pleasure. It is the unwillingness to do this that represents a turning point in their lives.</p>
<p>显然，为了一点小乐趣而付出巨大代价，为了一点小回报而做出巨大牺牲是不明智的。显然，这不是明智的行为。但人们往往就是这么做的。他们为了一点小回报而做出巨大牺牲。他们为了非常微小的表面优势而妥协自己的生活。他们为了非常小的乐趣而付出巨大代价。正是不愿意这样做才代表了他们生命中的转折点。</p>
<p>In the context of preparing for the Great Waves of change, the benefits that you will hold onto are so insignificant compared to the requirements placed upon you that to cling to these benefits represents a kind of self-betrayal. It is as if you have given over your life to some kind of dark force for some small pleasure or advantage. Here there is no escape from self-conflict. Here you cannot really relieve yourself of the problem, for once you have seen and known the truth, you cannot shake this off with all kinds of excuses and justifications.</p>
<p>在为变革巨浪做准备的过程中，你所坚持的利益与摆在你面前的要求相比是如此微不足道，以至于坚持这些利益代表着某种自我背叛。就像你为了一些小小的乐趣或优势而将自己的生命交给某种黑暗势力。在这里，你无法逃避自我冲突。在这里，你不能真正摆脱问题，因为一旦你看到了真理并知道了真理，你无法通过各种借口和理由摆脱这种困境。</p>
<p>These three stages all represent conscious acts: seeing, knowing, taking action. Most people will not look, so they will not see. They will not look, they will not really consider what they are seeing, so they look and do not see.</p>
<p>这三个阶段都代表着有意识的行为：看见、知道、采取行动。大多数人不愿意去看，所以他们不会看到。他们不愿意去看，也不会真正考虑他们看到的内识，所以他们看到了却没有真正看见。</p>
<p>The second error is that people will not be with what they see. They will either dismiss it or give it some kind of simple explanation and file it away somewhere within themselves. They will not keep it in front of them, looking at it. It passes them by. They will not be with it and see what it arouses within themselves, to really examine it and examine their own response to it.</p>
<p>第二个错误是，人们不会与他们看到的内识在一起。他们要么否定它，要么给它某种简单的解释，并把它归档在自己的某个地方。他们不会把它放在自己的面前，看着它。内识与他们擦肩而过。他们不会和内识在一起，看看它在自己内心引起了什么，真正审视它，审视他们自己对它的反应。</p>
<p>The third stage is taking action, and here again, people do not act. They say, “Ah, I must lose weight” or “I must stop eating this food” or “I must change my work” or “I must fortify my home” or “I must deal with my conflicts in this relationship” or “I must tell this person the thing I must tell them.” But they do not act, and so they are stuck. Trying to protect themselves or hold onto some advantage or pleasure, they now put themselves in jeopardy. They sacrifice their awareness, their sense of well-being and their sense of integrity. They are paying immense prices for some small, perceived pleasure or advantage. They are paying huge prices. This is not intelligent. Would you pay $10,000 for a piece of bread or a piece of candy or a little thrill or to avoid an inconvenience or a discomfort? To pay a large sum of money to do this would not be intelligent. You can see this. It is so clear.</p>
<p>第三个阶段是采取行动，而在这里，人们也不采取行动。他们说：“啊，我必须减肥”或者“我必须停止吃这种食物”或者“我必须换工作”或者“我必须加强我家的防护”或者“我必须处理我在这段关系中的冲突”或者“我必须告诉这个人我必须告诉他们的事情。”但他们不采取行动，所以他们被困住了。为了保护自己或保持某种优势或乐趣，他们现在让自己处于危险之中。他们牺牲了自己的觉知、幸福感和诚信感。他们为了某种小的、感知到的乐趣或优势付出了巨大的代价。他们付出了巨大的代价。这是不明智的。你会花10,000美元买一块面包、一块糖果、一点刺激，或者为了避免不便或不适吗？花大笔钱来做这件事是不明智的。你可以看到这一点，它是如此清晰。</p>
<p>So one must be willing to look, to really look at something, to really look at the Great Waves of change—to read about them, to investigate them, to see what they are, to learn more about the Great Waves and how they are affecting people in the world today and their potential for altering the course of human history. What are the implications? People have studied this. Intelligent people have looked at this and are warning others. What is the meaning of this? What are its implications? How could it alter your life and the lives of other people?</p>
<p>所以，人必须愿意去看，真正去看内识，真正去看变革的巨浪——去阅读它们，去调查它们，去了解它们是什么，去更多地了解巨浪以及它们如何影响当今世界的人们和它们改变人类历史进程的潜力。会产生什么影响？人们已经研究过这个。明智的人已经看到了这一点，并在警告他人。这意味着什么？它的影响是什么？它如何改变你的生活和其他人的生活？</p>
<p>Then there is being with what you know and have seen. “What does this really mean for me? Is this really true? And what must I do?”</p>
<p>然后是与你所知道的和所看到的在一起。”这对我来说真的意味着什么？这是真的吗？我必须做什么？”</p>
<p>Then there is taking action—beginning to move, picking yourself up, setting yourself on the road again, regaining your strength, expressing your self-determination and exercising your power and authority. Here you are governing the mind instead of being governed by it. Here you are directing your emotions instead of being directed by them. Here you are overcoming your inertia, overcoming your resistance, while you are gaining self-determination. All these three stages are powerful. They all restore to you your strength, your vision, your capabilities and your sense of direction in life.</p>
<p>接着是采取行动——开始行动，重新站起来，重新走上正轨，重新获得力量，表达自我决心并行使你的力量和权威。在这里，你在管理心灵，而不是被心灵所支配。在这里，你正在引导情绪，而不是被情绪所引导。在这里，你克服了惰性，克服了抵触情绪，同时你也在重新获得自决权。这三个阶段都非常强大。它们都能恢复你的力量、你的视野、你的能力以及你的生命方向感。</p>
<p>So many people do not have a sense of direction because they are not seeing, knowing and acting. They are just going through the motions of life. They are fulfilling social functions. They are doing what their culture tells them to do or what their family expects them to do. They are going through the motions. They are not really seeing very much, they are not really being with what they see sufficiently, and they are not taking action regarding those things that they see and know. And as a result, they are listless, being swept along in the current of what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>许多人没有方向感，因为他们没有在真正地看见、知道和行动。他们只是按部就班地生活，履行社会职能，做文化要求或家人期望的事情。他们只是顺从地生活，实际上并没有真正地看到许多东西，也没有充分地理解自己看到的东西，更没有对自己看到和知道的事情采取行动。结果，他们变得无精打采，被卷入了其他人所做的事情的潮流中。</p>
<p>The excuses for this are many, but they all lead to the same kind of self-betrayal. They all weaken you and disconnect you from Knowledge within yourself, Knowledge which is already giving you signs and confirmation. You lose the inspiration if you do not act. Action is necessary.</p>
<p>这方面的借口有许多，但它们都导致了同样的自我背叛。它们都削弱了你的力量，使你与自己内心的内识脱节，而内识已经在向你发出迹象和确认。如果你不采取行动，你就会失去灵感。行动是必要的。</p>
<p>In facing the Great Waves of change, you do not have much time. This is both a hazard and an advantage. It is a hazard because if you do not take action soon and begin to reconsider your life, to alter your circumstances and to set in train change that must occur both within your own thinking and emotions and your outer circumstances, you will be at a great disadvantage. For the Great Waves are moving and are already impacting the world and are gaining strength every day.</p>
<p>在面对变革的巨浪时，你没有太多的时间。这既是一种危险，也是一种优势。危险在于，如果你不尽快采取行动，开始重新考虑你的生活，改变你的境况，并开始改变你自己的思维和情感以及外部环境，你将处于非常不利的位置。因为变革的巨浪正在前进，已经对世界产生影响，并且每天都在增强。</p>
<p>The advantage in this is that it calls you into action now. It requires that you look and see, that you be with what you see and that you take action regarding it. This inspires action and determination. You do not have time to think about it for very long. You do not have time to vacillate. You do not have time to become ambivalent.</p>
<p>优势在于，它要求你现在就采取行动。这需要你去观察和看见，去感受你看到的情况，并对其采取行动。这激励了行动和决心。你没有太多时间来思考，也没有时间犹豫不决，更没有时间感到模棱两可。</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. If you are feeling the presence of the Great Waves and feel anxiety regarding them, then you are also feeling the anxiety regarding time. How are you spending your time? The discomfort that attends one when one is not responding is significant. And the fact that you do not have much time gives impetus for you to respond and to act.</p>
<p>时间至关重要。如果你感受到变革巨浪的存在，并为此感到焦虑，那你也会感受到时间的紧迫感。你如何度过你的时间？当人们没有回应时，随之而来的不适感是显著的。而时间不多的事实促使你做出回应并采取行动。</p>
<p>It takes time to change one’s thinking and one’s circumstances. It takes time, planning and consideration to alter one’s outer circumstances or to change one’s relationship with certain people. These things all take time. In many cases, they can be difficult because of the attachments that have been created and the lack of confidence that one has in oneself.</p>
<p>改变一个人的思维和环境需要时间。改变外部环境或改变与某些人的关系需要时间、计划和考虑。这些事情都需要时间。在许多情况下，由于已经形成的依附关系以及对自己的信心不足，它们可能会变得困难。</p>
<p>If you wait, then your freedom to respond becomes limited, your options become limited, and you are forced to take dramatic and often drastic actions, which may not be beneficial for you. You do not want to wait until the eleventh hour, for then you will have no options. Your circumstances will be dictated for you, and not by you. Having made no real preparation, you will have to yield to the demands of your situation. This is a position that has few advantages and often great hazards.</p>
<p>如果你等待，你对回应的自由就会变得有限，你的选择也会变得有限，你将被迫采取激烈且往往是极端的行动，而这些行动可能对你不利。你不想等到最后一刻，因为那时你将没有选择。你的环境将被强加给你，而不是由你自己决定。如果没有做出实际的准备，你将不得不屈从于情势的要求。这是一个优势很少且往往充满巨大危险的位置。</p>
<p>People wait to take action. They wait too long and then either they cannot take the action that would be most beneficial or they must pay a great price for doing it, far greater than they would have had to pay initially.</p>
<p>人们总是拖延行动。他们等得太久，结果要么他们不能采取最有利的行动，要么他们必须为这样做付出巨大的代价，远远超过他们最初必须付出的代价。</p>
<p>It is true, you must earn your freedom. It is not free. Every act of courage and integrity requires overcoming something, releasing something and escaping something, both within yourself and outside of yourself. Life is moving. You must move with it. You must prepare for it, you must respond to it, you must feel it and experience it, and you must take action.</p>
<p>它是真实的，你必须赢得你的自由。它不是免费的。每一个勇气和正直的行为都需要克服一些东西，放下一些东西，摆脱一些东西，这些东西既在你内心，也在你的外部。生命在前进。你必须跟随它前进。你必须为它做好准备，你必须对它做出回应，你必须感受它并体验它，你必须采取行动。</p>
<p>The “Recommendations for Living in a Great Waves World” provides a set of questions and directives that apply to nearly everyone. This is the beginning preparation for the Great Waves of change. It is the beginning because the Great Waves will be long lasting, and there is no set of written guidelines that can answer everyone’s needs and questions. Beyond fulfilling the “Recommendations” and using them fully, one must rely upon Knowledge and the wisdom one possesses and the wisdom of others to make wise decisions. Because everyone’s life is different—their circumstances, their obligations, their relationships and the state of their own mental and physical health—their pathways are all different. That is why one prescription will not work for everyone.</p>
<p>“生活在变革巨浪世界中的建议”提供了一套适用于几乎每个人的问题和指示。这是为应对变革巨浪所做的初步准备。这只是开始，因为变革巨浪是持久的，没有一套书面指南能够回答每个人的需求和问题。除了充分使用这些“建议”之外，人们还必须依靠内识、自身拥有的智慧以及他人的智慧来做出明智的决定。因为每个人的生活都是不同的——他们的环境、义务、关系以及他们自己的心理和身体健康状况——他们的途径都是不同的。这就是为什么一个处方不会对所有人都有效。</p>
<p>It is to bring you to the great guidance of Knowledge ultimately that will give you the strength and the wisdom you need to proceed. But certain initial preparations must be made. If your circumstances are putting you in great jeopardy in the face of the Great Waves of change, you must attend to them now. Do not wait, or you may not be able to change them.</p>
<p>最终，它是要引导你走向内识的伟大指引，这将赋予你前进所需的力量和智慧。但是，某些初步的准备工作是必须的。如果你的环境在变革巨浪面前让你处于极大的危险之中，你必须立即处理这些问题。不要拖延，否则你可能无法改变它们。</p>
<p>Where you live, how you live, how you move about, your work, your health, the amount of support you gain from your relationships, your behavior and your emotions—these are all very important. It is not enough to just change one’s thinking. One must change one’s life.</p>
<p>你的居住地、生活方式、出行方式、工作、健康状况、你从关系中获得的支持、你的行为以及你的情绪——这些都非常重要。仅仅改变思维是不够的，你必须改变你的生活。</p>
<p>Here you will have to override your social conditioning and your weaker tendencies—disappointing other people, breaking the chains that hold you in place. The power to do this comes from your determination not to be a slave to other forces, not to be bound and hindered by things that are not true and genuine. You build the strength to do this by doing this. This is what will carry you forward.</p>
<p>在这里，你将不得不推翻你的社会条件和你的弱者倾向——让他人失望，打破束缚你的枷锁。做到这一点的力量来自于你决心不成为其他力量的奴隶，不被虚假和不真实的关系束缚和阻碍。通过这样做，你将建立起前进的力量。这就是推动你前进的动力。</p>
<p>The New Message will provide the tools, but you must use them and learn to use them wisely—building the Four Pillars of your life to counteract eccentricity in areas of your life where you are in denial; building a solid foundation; building a strong relationship with yourself, with other people, with where you live, with what you do, with how you think; discovering your strengths and your weaknesses, fortifying the former and managing the latter. There is no other way if you are to become strong and self-determined in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>新讯息会提供工具，但你必须使用它们，并学会明智地使用它们——建立你生命的四大支柱，以抵消你生活中被否定的领域的偏心；建立一个坚实的基础；与你自己、与他人、与居住的地方、与所做的事情、与你的思维方式建立强大的关系；发现自己的优点和缺点，强化前者并管理后者。如果你想在面对变革巨浪时变得强大并带有自决权，就没有其他方法。</p>
<p>There is no safety and security now to hide behind or to relinquish your strength to. For what security will there be in pretending that there is not a great challenge, holding onto what little you have, attaching yourself to whatever gives you a temporary sense of security and well-being? What security will there be? What will not be challenged? What will not be vulnerable to the Great Waves of change?</p>
<p>现在没有安全和保障可以躲藏，也没有力量可以放弃。因为假装没有重大挑战，紧紧抓住你所拥有的少量资源，依附于任何给你暂时安全感和幸福感的关系，这还有什么安全可言？什么不会受到挑战？什么不会在变革巨浪中受到威胁？</p>
<p>Many people will go down with the ship because they do not want to leave the ship, while others have escaped, waiting to be rescued. This is the sad truth about human existence because humanity as a whole has not really become strong and united sufficiently. But individuals have and always have, and now many more must gain this strength and stability and this focus.</p>
<p>许多人会随着船沉没，因为他们不想离开这艘船，而其他人则已经逃脱，等待救援。这就是人类生存的悲哀事实，因为人类作为一个整体还没有真正变得足够强大和团结。但个人有足够的强大和团结，并且一直在这样做，现在更多的人必须获得这种力量、稳定性和专注力。</p>
<p>Life is giving you signs. It is telling you what is coming. Knowledge within you is giving you signs, urging you to respond.</p>
<p>生命正在给你提示，告诉你即将到来的事情。你内在的内识也在给你提示，敦促你做出回应。</p>
<p>People use confusion as a place to hide, to mask the things that they are recognizing and to avoid being with these things and taking action. It is like a smokescreen so that people will not have to see, know and act and take the risks and face the challenge. It is a group addiction. It is a mass avoidance.</p>
<p>人们常常用混乱作为隐藏的地方，用来掩盖他们所认识到的事情，避免面对这些事情并采取行动。这就像是一个烟幕，使得人们不必去看、不必去知道、不必去行动，也不必冒险和面对挑战。这是一种群体性成瘾，它是一种大规模的回避。</p>
<p>The masses of people are living at a very low level of integrity. You cannot allow this for yourself. You must choose otherwise, and if this means you have to leave your friends or break away from your family, this is what it will require. This is what has been required of all the great saints and messengers and all the people who have gone on to do important and great things. In nearly all cases, they had to break away from their former allegiances to have the freedom, the strength and the opportunity to assume a greater life and a greater service.</p>
<p>大量的人群生活在一个非常低的诚信水平上。你不能允许自己这样做。你必须做出其他选择，如果这意味着你必须离开朋友或脱离家庭，这就是必须要做的。所有伟大的圣徒、信使和那些做出重要和伟大事情的人，几乎在所有情况下都必须脱离他们之前的关系，以获得自由、力量和机会，去承担更伟大的生命和更伟大的服务。</p>
<p>Think not that your life is not important enough to do this. Pay attention to what you tell yourself in this regard. For there are many voices within you, but only one is true. There is the voice of your culture. There is the voice of your family and parents. There is the voice of your friends. There is the voice of your religious tradition, if you have a religious tradition. There is the voice of your teachers and other influential people in your life. Then there is the voice of Knowledge, which speaks through your feelings, through your ideas and through your physical sensations. Ultimately, only one of these voices is true. Knowledge may be reflected in the wisdom of your parents, the wisdom of your friends, the wisdom of your teachers, even the wisdom of your culture, but this wisdom is rare and exceptional.</p>
<p>不要认为你的生命不够重要而无法做到这一点。注意你自己对此说的话语。因为在你内心有许多声音，但只有一个是真实的。有文化的声音，有家庭和父母的声音，有朋友的声音，有你宗教传统的声音（如果你有宗教传统的话），还有你的老师和你生活中其他有影响力的人的声音。而后是内识的声音，它通过你的感觉、想法和身体感受来表达。最终，只有这些声音中的一个是真实的。内识可能会反映在你父母的智慧中，你朋友的智慧中，你老师的智慧中，甚至是你的文化的智慧中，但这种智慧是罕见和特殊的。</p>
<p>Take time now to be with this. Stop your endless running around and take time to be with this Greater Community message and to be with the reality of the Great Waves of change. Take retreat. Do not discuss it yet with your friends. You must consider it first within yourself. You must establish your own relationship with it first. Do not bring it into idle conversation. Do not seek the opinions of others until you yourself know the truth for yourself.</p>
<p>现在花点时间和内识在一起。停止你无休止的忙碌，花些时间和这个大社区的讯息以及变革巨浪的现实在一起。退隐一下。不要急于和朋友讨论。你必须先在自己内心中考虑它。你必须首先建立与你自己的关系。不要把它带入闲谈中。在你自己知道真理之前，不要寻求他人的意见。</p>
<p>This is discretion, and it is important. People give away their certainty through idle conversation with others. This is a calling to you, for you, not for them. They have their own calling. This is your calling. How will you respond to it?</p>
<p>这就是谨慎，而且它是重要的。人们通过与他人的闲聊丧失了自己的确定性。这是一个对你的召唤，为你，而不是为了他们。他们有他们自己的召唤。这是你的召唤。你将如何回应它？</p>
<p>Observe yourself. See what your mind tells you. Listen to the different voices within you. Do you use reason or emotion or the consensus of others or authority figures to dissuade you from being with something that you see? What are the ways that you undermine your certainty and invalidate your own experience? Do you use reason or faith or assumptions or other people’s authority or convention or history—what do you use to betray yourself and your experience? You must know this. You must know both your strengths and your weaknesses. You must know your tendencies regarding seeing, knowing and acting.</p>
<p>观察你自己。看看你的心灵在告诉你什么。倾听你内心的不同声音。你是否使用理性、情感、他人的共识或权威人物来劝阻自己面对你所看到的内识？你是如何削减自己的确定性，使你自己的经验无效？你是否用理性、信仰、假设、其他人的权威以及习俗或历史——来背叛你自己和你的经验？你必须知道这一点。你必须知道你的优势和劣势。你必须知道自己在观察、知道和行动方面的倾向。</p>
<p>You will need to moderate your behavior and your thinking. This can be done. You have the power. You are not simply a slave to your feelings or to your social conditioning. You have the power. But to know this power, you must use it, and you must act upon it. Otherwise, power is just an idea, a fleeting moment of experience, a recognition but not yet a functioning reality within you.</p>
<p>你需要调节自己的行为和思维。这是可以做到的。你拥有这种力量。你并非只是感情或社会条件的奴隶。你拥有力量。但要知道这份力量，你必须使用它，并付诸行动。否则，力量只是一个想法，一个转瞬即逝的体验时刻，一种认识，但尚未在你内心成为实际运作的现实。</p>
<p>The Great Waves have everything to do with who you are and why you are in the world. But how will you know this unless you become engaged, unless you take action, unless you commit yourself to taking this action? Relationship is realized through recognition, through resonance and through taking action. This is true with your relationship with a person, with a place or with a great set of events.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪与你是谁、你为何在这个世界上有着密切关系。但是，除非你参与其中，除非你采取行动，除非你承诺采取这一行动，否则你将如何知道这一点？关系通过认识、共鸣和行动来实现。这对于你与一个人、一个地方或一系列重大事件的关系都是如此。</p>
<p>You cannot sit on the sidelines and understand. You will never see the truth there. You must enter the fray because this is your life. This is why you have come. This has everything to do with your circumstances, with your well-being, with your freedom, with the value and quality of your life and with the value and quality of your most precious relationships.</p>
<p>你不能坐在旁观者的位置上理解。你永远不会在这里看到真理。你必须参与其中，因为这是你的生命。这就是你来到这里的原因。这与你的处境、与你的福祉、与你的自由、与你生命的价值和质量、与你最宝贵的关系的价值和质量息息相关。</p>
<p>This is why God has given you Knowledge—to guide you, to protect you and to lead you into a greater life. This is why Knowledge holds the key to whether you will respond to the Great Waves and to the wisdom, the meaning and the value of your response.</p>
<p>这就是为什么上帝赋予你内识——为了引导你、保护你，并引领你进入更大的生命。这就是为什么内识掌握着你是否会回应变革的巨浪，回应智慧、意义和价值的关键。</p>
<p>You must be willing to do things that other people are not doing. You must be willing to see things that other people are not seeing, to know things that other people are not knowing and to take action that other people are not taking because in truth you may be the only person you know or one of very few you know who is doing anything to respond and to prepare. This is how Knowledge becomes strong in you.</p>
<p>你必须愿意做其他人不愿做的事情。你必须愿意看见其他人看不见的内识，知道其他人不知道的内识，并采取其他人没有采取的行动，因为事实上，你可能是你知道的唯一一个或很少数几个正在回应和准备的人。这就是内识在你身上变得强大的方式。</p>
<p>Human beings are not herds of cattle or herds of sheep though they can behave like this in so many ways. Yet this is not their reality. To gain the strength to respond differently, you must adopt this strength and you must act upon it. There is no other way for you to know its truth and its value for you.</p>
<p>人类不是成群的牛羊，尽管他们在许多方面可以表现得像这样。然而，这并不是他们的现实。要获得以不同方式回应的力量，你必须采用这种力量，你必须根据它采取行动。你没有其他方式来知道它的真理以及它对你的价值。</p>
<p>Life now is giving you the perfect motivation to do this. You are no longer living under quiescent circumstances where nothing is demanding anything of you. To the contrary, you are living under evermore demanding circumstances, and life is demanding many things from you. What is the most important thing that life is demanding? To answer this question, look not only within yourself, but also beyond yourself to see what is brewing on the horizon. Events will happen whether you are ready or not. You cannot wish them away. They will happen no matter what your state of mind or state of consciousness.</p>
<p>现在的生命给你提供了完美的动机去做这件事情。你不再生活在平静的环境中，没有任何人来要求你。恰恰相反，你正生活在越来越苛刻的环境中，生命要求你做许多事情。生命最重要的要求是什么？要回答这个问题，不仅要向内看，还要向外看，看看地平线上正在酝酿什么。无论你是否准备好，事件都会发生。你不能希望它们消失。无论你的心灵或意识状态如何，它们都会发生。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change are coming. They are building. They are emerging on the horizon. They are already affecting millions of people around the world. What will you do now? What will you follow? What voice within yourself will you follow? What wisdom beyond yourself will you heed? How much courage will you muster? How far will you go in your preparation? How seriously will you take the situation? To what degree will you compromise yourself to meet the intentions or the expectations of others?</p>
<p>变革的巨浪即将来临。它们正在形成，它们正在地平线上出现。它们已经开始影响全球数百万人。你现在要做什么？你会追随什么？你会听从内心的哪种声音？你会听从在你自己之外的哪种智慧？你将积攒多少勇气？你会在准备工作中走多远？你会如何认真对待这种情况？你会在多大程度上妥协自己以迎合他人的意图或期望？</p>
<p>Only you can answer these questions. Here you are being given the gift of awareness. This is a gift that is given with love and with respect. God honors the great strength in you, a great strength that you are only beginning to discover. God honors your greater purpose for being in the world, a greater purpose that you are only beginning to discern and to discover. God is giving you the great advantage of forewarning—a forewarning that will be up to you to discern and to either accept or reject.</p>
<p>只有你能回答这些问题。在这里，你的存在已经给予觉知的礼物。这是一个充满爱与尊重的礼物。上帝尊重你内在的伟大力量，这是一种你才刚刚开始发现的伟大力量。上帝尊重你在世界上的更伟大目的，这是一种你才刚刚开始辨别和发现的更大目的。上帝给你预警的巨大优势——一个由你自己来辨别和接受或拒绝的预警。</p>
<p>This is God’s gift to you. And it must be your gift to yourself. It must be your gift to your children, to your friends, to your family and to anyone who has the power and the intelligence to listen.</p>
<p>这是上帝给予你的礼物。而这必须是你给予你自己的礼物。它必须是你给你的孩子、你的朋友、你的家人以及任何有能力和智慧倾听的人的礼物。</p>
<p>You must prepare your children, for they will be living in a world of ever greater change and difficulty. You strengthen them not by telling them what is coming, but by strengthening their connection to Knowledge, by teaching them the difference between fantasy and reality, by helping them to discern the nature of their own strengths and weaknesses, by sharing with them the wisdom that you have learned in life and by showing them where they can gain greater wisdom through the experiences of others.</p>
<p>你必须为你的孩子做好准备，因为他们将生活在一个变化和困难越来越大的世界中。你不会通过告诉他们将会发生什么来增强他们的能力，而是通过增强他们与内识的连接，教他们区分幻想和现实，帮助他们辨别自己的优点和缺点，分享你在生活中学到的智慧，并向他们展示如何通过他人的经验获得更大的智慧。</p>
<p>This is an immense gift to your children. But your greatest gift is through demonstration—the integrity and the quality of the life that you determine and that you choose and how you respond to the demands of life. This is the greatest gift to your children. If you are weak and compromised, that is what you will teach them. If you are self-deceiving, that is what you will teach them. If you capitulate to the expectations of others, that is what you will teach them.</p>
<p>这对你的孩子来说是一个极好的礼物。但你最大的礼物是通过示范——你所决定和选择的生命的完整性和质量，以及你如何应对生命的要求。这是给你孩子最大的礼物。如果你是软弱与妥协，这就是你教给他们的示范。如果你自欺欺人，这就是你将教给他们的示范。如果你屈从于他人的期望，这就是你将教给他们的示范。</p>
<p>Yet if you truly can see, if you truly can know and can truly take action, this is what you will teach them. If you recognize that life is changing and moving and that you must change and move with it, that is what you will teach them. If you can experience the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself and express this and act upon this, that is what you will teach them. They are looking to you to teach them either wisdom or folly, self-respect or self-deception. You are a leader in this regard.</p>
<p>然而，如果你真正地看见，真正地知道并采取行动，这就是你会教给他们的。如果你认识到生命在变化和前进，你必须随着它变化和前进，这就是你教给他们的。如果你能够体验到你内心的内识的力量和存在，并表现和付诸行动，这就是你教给他们的。他们正在期待你教他们智慧或愚蠢，自尊或自欺。在这方面，你是一位领导者。</p>
<p>There are other people in your life who are looking to you also, to see what you can teach them. It is your demonstration born of Knowledge, born of wisdom, born of seeing, knowing and acting that will be the inspiration that you give to others, and this inspiration will be immensely important.</p>
<p>在你的生活中，还有其他人也在期待你，看你能教他们什么。你的示范源于内识，源于智慧，源于看见、知道和行动的示范，这将是你给予他人的启发，而这种启发将是无比重要的。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life loves humanity and has given humanity the power and the presence of Knowledge and has given humanity an Angelic Presence to oversee the world and to provide guidance and counsel to those who are beginning to respond to the presence of Knowledge within themselves. You cannot understand this intellectually, but it is already part of your experience.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者爱着人类，并给了人类内识的力量和存在，也给了人类一个天使般的存在来监督世界，并为那些开始对自身内识的存在做出反应的人提供指导和咨询。你无法从理智上理解这一点，但这已经是你经验的一部分。</p>
<p>You must put your faith in the strength that God has put within you and in the strength and integrity that God has put within others. Focus on those who can respond and not on those who cannot respond. Give to those who can receive the gift and share it with others. Encourage those who are responding instead of trying to persuade those who cannot or will not respond. Gather around you those who are strong and who see the need to become strong. Do not spend time and energy trying to persuade someone who cannot or will not respond. That will only waste your vitality, which must be brought to bear now.</p>
<p>你必须把信仰寄托在上帝放置在你内心的力量和完整性之上，以及其他人内心的力量和完整性之上。专注于那些能够回应的人，而不是那些不能回应的人。给予那些能够接收礼物并与他人分享的人。鼓励那些正在回应的人，而不是试图说服那些不能或不愿回应的人。在你身边聚集那些坚强的人，以及那些认为自己需要变得坚强的人。不要浪费时间和精力去说服那些不能或不愿回应的人。这只会浪费你的活力，而这种活力现在必须被有效地使用。</p>
<p>Humanity will be led by those who are strong with Knowledge and by those who recognize the importance of their integrity and the value of their true relationships. Everyone who can do this is a leader—within their families, within their circle of friends and influence, even within the leadership of those in religion and government.</p>
<p>人类将由内识的强者所领导，他们通过内识认识到自身正直的重要性和真实关系的价值。每个能做到这一点的人都是领导者——在他们的家庭中，在他们的朋友圈中，在他们的影响力中，甚至在宗教和政府的领导层中。</p>
<p>Your task now is to prepare and to become strong with Knowledge. Do not take your eyes off this task. Do not become overly concerned with other people. Do not become disheartened at the lack of response in people around you. You must bring all of your attention to bear on what you yourself must do. It will take all of your strength to do this.</p>
<p>你现在的任务是做好准备，成为内识的强者。不要把你的目光从这项任务上移开。不要过度关注其他人。不要因为你周围的人缺乏反应而变得灰心。你必须把你所有的注意力放在你自己必须做的事情上。它将需要你所有的力量来做这件事。</p>
<p>Do not complain about the world. Do not be overly critical of other people, for in the face of the Great Waves of change, many people will increase their foolishness and their self-deception. They will act even more foolishly. But you must bring your attention to bear on what is before you to see, to know and to do. If others are sinking, you must rise. If others are failing, you must succeed.</p>
<p>不要抱怨这个世界。不要过于批评他人，因为在面临巨大的变化时，许多人会更加愚蠢和自欺欺人。他们的行为可能会更加愚蠢。但是，你必须把注意力集中在你眼前要看的、要知道的和要做的事情上。如果其他人正在沉沦，你必须奋起。如果其他人正在失败，你必须成功。</p>
<p>This then will be your gift to others. You will give others this strength as you gain it yourself. This begins to fulfill a greater purpose and a greater destiny that you have for being in the world. For there is your specific contribution, which remains to be discovered, and then there is the power and the presence of Knowledge. Receive this power, express this power and encourage this power in others. Teach your children the power and the presence of Knowledge within themselves and the great dangers of self-deception and social manipulation.</p>
<p>这将是你对他人的礼物。你将在自己获得力量的同时，将这份力量赠予他人。这开始实现你在这个世界上的更大目的和天命。因为你的具体贡献尚待发现，而内识的力量和存在也同样重要。接收这股力量，表达这股力量，并鼓励他人发挥这股力量。教导你的孩子认识到他们内在的内识力量和存在，以及自我欺骗和社会操控的极大危险。</p>
<p>If you can do this, you will see that the Great Waves of change, though extremely hazardous and consequential, in fact represent a great calling. It is a great calling for Knowledge to emerge and a great calling for people to respond and to become strong and united—to cease their endless conflicts with one another, to unite to protect the world, to preserve what is great in the human family and to lay the foundation for a greater future and a new direction, a new way forward for humanity.</p>
<p>如果你能做到这一点，你就会发现，变革的巨浪虽然极其危险、后果极其严重，但实际上代表着一种伟大的召唤。这是对内识出现的伟大召唤，也是对人们做出回应、变得强大和团结的伟大召唤——停止彼此之间无休止的冲突，团结起来保护世界，维护人类大家庭的伟大之处，为人类更伟大的未来和新的方向、新的前进道路奠定基础。</p>
<p>These are the great times in which you live. They call for the greatness that you have brought into the world from your Ancient Home—a power and a presence which you must now experience for yourself.</p>
<p>这就是你所处的伟大时代。它们召唤着你从远古家园带入世界的伟大——一种你现在必须亲身体验的力量和存在。</p>
