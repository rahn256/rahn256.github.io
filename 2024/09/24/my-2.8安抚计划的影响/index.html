It is more difficult to find the real answers. People are hungry for answers, but they do not have the awareness yet. So when considering the message in The Allies Briefings, people must begin to develop a Greater Community awareness and sensitivity. Just getting answers to questions does not develop this awareness or sensitivity. And indeed, even if you have the right answer, if you cannot experience it, if you cannot recognize it, if you cannot see its application, well, what good is it? It is lost on the person who is asking.</p>
<p>提出问题很容易，但找到真实的答案则更为困难。人们渴望得到答案，但他们还不具备这种觉知。因此，在考虑人类的盟友简报的讯息时，人们必须开始发展大社区的觉知和敏感性。仅仅得到答案并不能发展这种觉知和敏感性。即使你拥有正确的答案，如果不能体验、识别或理解其应用，那又有什么意义呢？对于提问者来说，这些答案就失去了价值。</p>
<p>Therefore, it always comes back to developing the awareness and sensitivity and the ability to know. People want proof, and so they go to whoever they think is the expert, and the expert gives their opinions, and people say, “Ah! This must be the proof because the expert said so.” But it is all opinions. Without Knowledge, everything is just opinions in the mind. And these opinions are developed by people’s conditioning, by their attitudes and by their temperament. People can experience something and make conclusions and evaluations but be completely wrong in their estimation.</p>
<p>因此，它总是回到发展觉知和敏感性以及知道的能力上。人们想要证据，所以他们去找他们认为是专家的人，接受他们的意见，人们说：“啊！这一定是证据，因为专家是这么说的。”然而，这些都是意见，没有内识，一切都只是心灵中的意见，而这些意见是由人们的条件、态度和气质形成的。人们可以经历一些事情并做出结论和评价，但他们的评估是完全错误的。</p>
<p>However, we are talking about higher consciousness here. We are not talking about having answers. Answers, without this higher consciousness, will not be enough, and their application will not be understood. Ultimately, you must gain this higher consciousness. This consciousness transcends human culture, human conditioning and even your biological identity. It is an awareness of life as it is moving all around you and through everything else. You need this higher consciousness to understand the plants and the animals, the weather and the movement of the world. You need this to understand the presence of negative forces in the mental environment and the presence of the Angelic Forces, which are here to serve you. And certainly, you must have this consciousness to be aware of the Greater Community forces in the world, to recognize their manifestations, their intentions and their methods. You need this higher awareness to tell friend from foe.</p>
<p>然而，我们在这里谈论的是更高的意识。而非仅仅是答案。如果没有这种更高的意识，答案是不够的，其应用也不会被理解。归根结底，你必须获得这种更高的意识。这种意识超越了人类的文化、人类的条件，甚至你的生理身份。它是一种对生命的觉知，因为它在你周围和其他一切生命中运动。你需要这种更高的意识来理解植物和动物、天气和世界的运动。你需要这种更高的意识来理解心理环境中负面力量的存在和天使力量的存在，它们在这里为你们服务。当然，你也必须有这种意识，才能察觉到世界上的大社区力量，才能识别出它们的表现、它们的意图和它们的方法。你需要这种更高的意识来区分朋友和敌人。</p>
<p>So when people ask a lot of questions, the real answer is the development of higher consciousness. This leads you into the mystery, where you may not be willing to go, but this is where you must go if you are going to understand. This is the mystery of your life—the mystery of what you know, the mystery of who you are, the mystery of why you are here and the mystery of what you must respond to. You are not here simply to fill your mind with more answers that cannot be recognized or understood.</p>
<p>所以，当人们问了很多问题时，真正的答案是发展更高的意识。这将引领你进入一个神秘的领域，你可能不愿意去，但如果你要理解，这是你必须去的地方。这就是你生命的神秘——你所知道的神秘，你是谁的神秘，你为什么在这里的神秘，以及你必须回应的神秘。你来到这里，并不只是为了在心灵中填满更多无法识别或理解的答案。</p>
<p>This, then, moves things in the right direction. Yet of course there are people who cannot tolerate the mystery and must have answers, thinking answers will resolve their inquiry. These people will constitute the majority of people who inquire about The Allies Briefings and who will question you about it. You, personally, cannot answer all the questions there are about the Allies—who they are, where they come from, how they got here, their method of propulsion, where they are hiding and how they communicate. How can you possibly answer all these questions?</p>
<p>这样，生命就会朝着正确的方向发展。然而，当然也有一些人无法容忍这种神秘感，他们必须有答案，认为答案可以解决他们的疑问。这些人将构成大多数对人类盟友简报感兴趣的人，他们会就此向你提问。你个人无法回答关于盟友的所有问题——他们是谁，他们来自哪里，他们如何来到这里，他们的推进方式，他们藏在哪里，以及他们如何沟通。你怎么可能回答所有这些问题呢？</p>
<p>However, you can be aware of the Allies, and you have the ability to recognize the validity of their message. You have learned enough about life and about nature to understand their point of view and what they emphasize and why it is necessary. This is because of higher consciousness, not because you have answers. The Allies of Humanity Briefings promote questions. The reason they don’t answer every question is because you must develop the higher consciousness. If they told the reader everything about themselves, people would say, “Huh, I don’t believe it! Marshall’s making it all up!” You see, without the higher consciousness, people cannot make a connection.</p>
<p>然而，你可以察觉到盟友的存在，并有能力认识到他们讯息的有效性。你已经学到了足够的关于生命和自然的理解，让你能够理解他们的观点、他们强调的信息，以及为什么有必要这样做。这是因为更高的意识，而不是因为你有答案。人类盟友的简报鼓励提问。它们不回答所有问题的原因是因为你必须发展更高的意识。如果它们告诉读者所有关于自己的事情，人们可能会说：“哼，我才不相信！马歇尔在编造这一切！”你看，没有更高的意识，人们就无法建立联系。</p>
<p>Already you can see the effects of the Pacification Program that is being generated by the Intervention. There are already many people who have fallen prey to this, either by their own inclinations or by outside influence. Here people are led to believe that they can not really judge anything. “Well, I don’t want to be negative. I’ll be open to it.” Who told them to be open to it? “I’ll be open to whatever happens.” Who told them to be open to whatever happens? People’s critical discernment is being destroyed. So something happens and they say, “Well, you know, I don’t want to judge the situation.” What are you talking about! You need to evaluate what is happening. These people think they cannot be critical. “Well, I can’t really be critical. I don’t want to be negative.” Well, it may be necessary to speak out and say that something is really not appropriate. But these people can’t even do that. People who have been affected by this Pacification Program cannot even make a decision. They cannot look at anything and say, “Well, this is a good thing,” or “This is really not a good thing for me.” So they welcome everything, thinking that is how you must be with life.</p>
<p>你已经可以看到干预所产生的安抚计划的影响。已经有很多人因为自己的倾向或外部影响而成为这个计划的牺牲品。在这里，人们被引导相信他们无法真正评判的任何事情。“好吧，我不想消极对待，我将对它持开放态度。”是谁告诉他们要开放的？“无论发生什么，我都会坦然面对。”谁告诉他们要对发生的任何事情持开放态度？人们的批判性辨别能力正在被摧毁。于是，一旦发生某事，他们就会说：“嗯，你知道的，我不想判断这种情况。”你在说什么呢！你需要评估正在发生的事情。这些人认为他们不能提出批评。“好吧，我真的不能批评，我不想变得消极。”好吧，也许有必要大声疾呼，说某些事情真的不合适。但这些人连这一点都做不到。受到安抚计划影响的人们甚至无法做出决定，他们无法看待任何事情并说：“嗯，这是件好事”或者“这对我来说真的不是一件好事。”所以他们迎接一切，认为这就是自己必须与生命相处的方式。</p>
<p>That is not how you must be with life. It is true you must be willing to look at everything. But it is not true that you must accept everything, bond with everything, welcome everything. Of course not! Higher consciousness does not mean that you do not make critical evaluations. It simply means you view things from a higher vantage point. This does not mean that everything becomes gray. It means that everything becomes clear. You clearly see what to do and what not to do, what is good and what is not good. If this is not the product of spiritual study, then someone is being disabled.</p>
<p>这不是你必须与生命相处的方式。诚然，你必须愿意看待一切。但这并不意味着你必须接受一切，与一切结合，欢迎一切。绝对不是！更高的意识并不意味着你不进行批判性的评估。它只是意味着你从一个更高的观测位置看待生命。这并不意味着一切都变得灰暗。而是意味着一切变得清晰。你清楚地看见该做什么，什么是不该做的，什么是好的，什么是不好的。如果这不是精神研究的结果，那这个人正在失去能力。</p>
<p>While it is true you must learn not to judge a situation based upon your conditioning or beliefs, ultimately you must judge a situation based upon Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. This is the final arbiter in your discernment.</p>
<p>虽然你必须学会不根据自己的条件或信仰来判断情况，但最终你必须根据内识来判断情况，即生活在你内心深处的精神智能。这是你辨别的最终仲裁者。</p>
<p>However, people do not recognize this. They take the first step and they think it is the last step. The first step is where you do not judge. This means you must learn to look and recognize something, which you cannot do if you judge it immediately. This is the first step, but people think it is the last step. The last step is very different from the first step. You do not judge in the moment because you need to see and know and recognize what you are looking at. This is discernment. You cannot be discerning if you judge things outright. Yet beyond this discernment, you must see clearly if something is good or not.</p>
<p>然而，人们并没有认识到这一点。他们迈出了第一步，他们却认为这是最后一步。第一步是你不做判断。这意味着你必须学习去观察和识别某些事物，如果你立即判断它，你就无法做到这一点。这是第一步，但人们认为它是最后一步。最后一步与第一步非常不同。你在当下不进行判断，因为你需要看见、知道并识别你正在观察的事物。这就是辨别力。如果你直接判断事物，你就无法具备辨别的能力。然而，在这种辨别力之外，你必须清楚地看见一件事是好是坏。</p>
<p>So you may recognize that the Intervention really is not good for humanity. In itself, the Intervention is not a good thing! But if you say, “Oh, I cannot judge the situation,” how will you ever know? You may want to think, “Well, it’s probably good at some other level.” A pacified person will say, “I will see how it is good for us because everything that happens is good for us.” This is not only human ignorance; this demonstrates the effects of the Pacification Program, which encourages people to trust things unwittingly, without discernment.</p>
<p>因此，你可能会识别到干预对人类来说确实并不好。就其本身而言，干预并不是一件好事！但如果你说：“哦，我无法判断这个情况，”那你又如何能知道呢？你可能会想，“好吧，它可能在其他层面上是好的。”一个被安抚的人会说：“我会看看这对我们有什么好处，因为发生的所有事情都是好的。”这不仅是人类的无知，这显示了安抚计划的影响，它鼓励人们在不知不觉中信任集体，没有辨别的能力。</p>
<p>You can see this everywhere. You can see it in the UFO community. You can see it in spiritual communities. You can see it emerging in people all around you. The Allies Briefings will create a stir because they advocate discernment. They say, “The Intervention is not good for you.” Yet many people say, “Well, I don’t know. It must be good. I mean, it can’t be bad.” They’re befuddled. They don’t know what to think. “Well, I don’t know. I can’t really come to any decisions about it.” What are you talking about? Has your decision making become disabled? And if so, who disabled it? Why are some people thinking they must be open to everything and receptive to everything? Yes, they want to be non-judgmental, but that is only the first step. They don’t take the next step. They don’t exercise discernment. In some cases, their discernment has fallen away.</p>
<p>你可以在各处看到这种现象。它存在于UFO社区，存在于精神社区，存在于你周围的人群中。盟友的简报会引起轰动，因为它们倡导辨别力。它们说：“干预对你们不好。”然而，许多人会说：“嗯，我不知道。它一定是好的。我的意思是，它不可能是坏的。”他们困惑不已，不知道该怎么想。“嗯，我不知道。我真的无法对此做出任何决定。”你在说什么？你的决策能力已经丧失了吗？如果是这样，是谁削弱了它？为什么有些人认为自己必须对一切开放并接受一切？是的，他们想不做判断，但这只是第一步。他们没有迈出下一步，他们没有运用辨别力。在某些情况下，他们的辨别力已经下降。</p>
<p>This is a critical problem. As a result of this Pacification Program, people cannot see and cannot know, and basically, though they are confused and frightened perhaps, they will just go along. “Well, I’ll just go along. I’ll just try to accept what is happening in my life.” People who are pacified can’t resist. They can’t fight against something because they don’t think it’s all right to do that. They think that everything has to be embraced. Where did this come from?</p>
<p>这是一个严重的问题。由于这个安抚计划，基本上，人们无法看见，也无法知道，尽管他们可能感到困惑和恐惧，但他们还是会顺从。“好吧，我就顺其自然吧。我只是试着接受在我的生活中所发生的事情。”被安抚的人无法反抗。他们无法抗争，因为他们认为这样做是不对的。他们认为一切都必须被拥抱。这种想法从何而来？</p>
<p>These ideas of unquestioned acceptance are prevalent in much of the spiritual teaching you see today. And people accept these ideas wholeheartedly. They think, “Well, this is the higher truth. We follow the higher truth.” Consider this in the light of the Pacification Program and you will begin to see how pervasive it really is.</p>
<p>这些毫无质疑接受一切的想法在如今的许多精神教导中普遍存在。人们全心全意地接受这些想法。他们认为：“嗯，这是更高的真理。我们在遵循更高的真理。”在安抚计划的背景下思考这个问题，你就会开始看到它到底有多普遍。</p>
<p>People who are being pacified will be led to believe that they are gaining higher consciousness when in fact all of their power is being taken away from them. The Pacification Program is based upon an understanding of human psychology and human tendencies. Here people are conditioned to think that in order to be acceptable to God, they must basically give away what God has given them to use. “Well, to be acceptable to God, I must be meek and mild and non-judgmental and all-embracing of everything. I will look for the good in everything.”</p>
<p>被安抚的人会相信自己在获得更高的意识，而事实上，他们所有的力量都在被夺走。安抚计划是基于对人类心理和人类倾向的理解。在这里，人们被灌输一种思想，即为了被上帝所接受，他们必须放弃上帝赋予他们使用的内识。“好吧，为了被上帝接受，我必须温顺、温和、不做判断，包容一切。我将在一切事物中寻找美好。”</p>
<p>Where did this come from? Is such acquiescence purely a human invention? Is this something that people just concoct for themselves in order to be happy in the moment? Well, in some cases, this is true. But consider the pacification of humanity. How are people pacified? They are told what they want to hear, and they are told they don’t really need to consider anything else. After all, if everything that happens to you is good, then why resist anything? Just embrace it all! This is the Pacification Program at work.</p>
<p>这种思想从何而来？难道这种默许纯粹是人类的发明？这是人们为了让自己暂时感到幸福而编造出来的吗？嗯，在某些情况下，确实如此。但是，考虑一下人类的安抚问题。如何安抚人类？他们被告知他们想听到的事情，他们被告知他们真的不需要考虑其他任何事情。毕竟，如果发生在你身上的一切都是好的，那为什么还要抵抗呢？只要拥抱这一切就可以了！这就是安抚计划在起作用。</p>
<p>This influence is becoming omnipresent around you. People flock to places where the Intervention is operating, thinking that the “energy” there is so high. They say, “This is such an enlightening place.” Oh, my God! They are jumping into the fire. They are giving themselves away wholeheartedly. They go to these places and they feel the energy there, and they think, “Oh, this is really a powerful place. This is where it is happening!” And the longer they stay, the less they know, and the less they think they can return to their former lives. They become ever more listless and self-involved, and they become ever more dysfunctional.</p>
<p>这种影响正在你们周围变得无处不在。人们蜂拥而至干预活动的地方，认为那里的“能量”很高。他们说，“这真是一个令人醍醐灌顶的地方”。哦，我的上帝！他们正在跳进火坑。他们全心全意地把自己交了出去。他们去到这些地方，感受到那里的能量，他们会想：”哦，这真是一个强大的地方。这就是能量正在发生的地方！”但他们在那里待的时间越长，他们知道的就越少，也就越不认为自己能回到从前的生活。他们变得越来越无精打采，越来越自我为中心，越来越功能失调。</p>
<p>This disengagement produces an anxiety at a deeper level, a level where you know that your life is not progressing and that you are not going where you need to go. Yet these people will think that this discomfort is part of their fear, or part of their psychology that must be eradicated and exorcised out of themselves. And so they will work hard to ignore the very signs that are telling them that their lives are amiss and that they are losing their lives.</p>
<p>这种脱离现实会在更深层面产生一种焦虑感，在这个层面上，你知道你的生命没有进展，你没有去到你应该去的地方。然而，这些人会认为这种不安是他们的恐惧，或者是他们心理的一部分，必须从自己身上被消除和驱逐。所以他们会努力去忽视那些正在告诉他们，生活出问题了，他们正在失去自己生命的信号。</p>
<p>They will say, “All is love. Just be loving. There is only love.” If they knew what they were talking about, actually that would be true. But they think love is simply passivity, happiness and acquiescence because that is the Pacification Program working on them. Now they are extending it to other people and becoming pacifiers themselves. And after awhile, well, they will not know what they know. And if something is really wrong, they will feel discomfort, but they will think it is just part of their psychological problem, and they will try to overlook it or remove it or bury it. And then they will do whatever is told them to do by the Intervention. They will say, “Oh, I got a message. I have to go do this. I am being guided. This is inner guidance for me.”</p>
<p>他们会说：“一切都是爱。只要充满爱。世上就只有爱。”如果他们知道自己在说什么，这其实是真实的。但他们认为爱只是被动的、幸福的和默许的，因为这正是安抚计划在他们身上起作用的结果。现在，他们把这种观念传递给其他人，自己也成为了安抚者。一段时间后，他们将不知道自己所知的。如果真的出了问题，他们会感到不舒服，但他们会认为这只是他们心理问题的一部分，他们会试图忽略它、消除它或掩盖它。然后，他们会按照干预者的指示行事。他们会说：“哦，我收到了一个讯息。我必须去做这件事。我被引导了。这就是我的内在指导。”</p>
<p>It will be very hard to awaken people from this. You have to awaken yourself first. People are so immersed in their listlessness and their pursuit of happiness, it’s almost like they are beyond reach. They are so lulled and so conditioned, you would have to drop a bomb in their laps to wake them up!</p>
<p>要把人们从这里面唤醒将是非常困难的。你必须首先唤醒你自己。人们是如此沉浸在他们的无精打采和对幸福的追求中，就好像它们遥不可及。他们被如此催眠和条件化，以至于你必须在他们面前丢下一颗炸弹才能唤醒他们！</p>
<p>You can see the effects of the Pacification Program in spiritual communities in many places. Certainly not to all people, but to many people, acquiescence looks like the easy path, the easy way, the way to true happiness. Give up knowing anything, give up evaluating anything, give up resisting anything, and it looks like, “Oh, everything is just happiness from now on. Smooth sailing ahead!”</p>
<p>你可以在许多地方的精神社区中看到安抚计划的影响。当然不是对所有人都是如此，但对许多人来说，默许看起来是一条简单的道路，一条容易的道路，一条通往真正幸福的道路。放弃知道任何事，放弃评估任何事，放弃抗拒任何事，这看起来就像是：“哦，从现在开始一切都只是幸福。前方一帆风顺！”</p>
<p>These nice people, the Intervention will simply lull them into a listless state and then basically they will not be a problem, and they will be receptive to whatever is given them. Their natural knowing will be so removed from their awareness, it will become the enemy now. They will think it is fearfulness. They will think it is negativity. And they will not want any part of it.</p>
<p>这些好人，干预者会轻易地把他们哄入一种无精打采的状态，然后他们基本上就不会成为问题，并且会接收任何给予他们的想法。他们的自然认知将从他们的觉知中被彻底移除，现在它将成为敌人。他们会认为这是恐惧。他们会认为这是消极。而且他们将不想要它的任何部分。</p>
<p>This is actually happening now. We are talking about an extreme case, but these extreme cases are growing in scope and magnitude. Many more people are simply falling into this state—even the young people, some of whom are especially prone to this kind of conditioning.</p>
<p>这实际上现在正在发生。我们正在谈论一个极端的案例，但这些极端的案例在范围和程度上都在增长。越来越多的人正陷入这种状态——甚至是年轻人，他们中的一些人特别容易受到这种影响。</p>
<p>Consider this. True happiness comes from being true to yourself, from developing your own integrity and from living honorably with your integrity. True relationships are based upon sharing real integrity with others, building relationships of integrity, relationships that express your deeper nature and purpose in life.</p>
<p>考虑一下这个问题。真正的幸福来自于忠于你自己，来自于发展你自己的正直，来自于以你的诚信为荣的生活。真正的关系是基于与他人分享真正的完整性，建立完整的关系，表达你生命更深层次的自然和目的的关系。</p>
<p>However, look at the relationships of a pacified person, who says, “Well, we’re together as long as it feels good, as long as it’s okay, and if we’re not together, it’s okay, and whatever we do is okay.” But it’s not okay. And they know it’s not okay, but their natural knowing has been removed from their awareness. As a result, they say, “I will not feel those things. They disrupt my happiness, my peace, my equanimity.” And yet there is no peace or equanimity because there is no integrity, and because there is no integrity, there is no real relationship.</p>
<p>然而，看看一个被安抚的人建立的关系，他会说：“好吧，只要感觉好，只要没有问题我们就会在一起，如果我们不在一起也没有关系，无论我们做什么都没有关系。”但这是不对的。他们知道这并不对，但他们的自然认知已经从他们的觉知中移除。结果，他们会说：“我不想去感受内心。它们会扰乱我的幸福、我的和平、我的平静。”然而，因为没有完整性，也就没有真正的和平或平静。没有完整性，也就没有真正的关系。</p>
<p>Do you see here how the poison is immersed in the very food that people want to eat? Spiritual food is being poisoned. How many spiritual teachers today are teaching real discernment? How many are promoting real personal integrity? How many are encouraging people to look clearly and see? How many teachers are encouraging their students to respond to the world? There are indeed some, but look around and you will see the Pacification Program being promoted unknowingly.</p>
<p>你看到了吗？毒药被混入了人们想要吃的食物中。精神的食物正在被毒害。今天有多少精神导师在教导真正的辨别力？有多少人在倡导真正的个人完整性？有多少人在鼓励人们看清楚、看明白？有多少导师在鼓励他们的学生对世界作出回应？确实有一些导师这样做，但看看周围，你会看到安抚计划正在不知不觉中被推广。</p>
<p>How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from.</p>
<p>对外星议程来说，这是多么完美的计划。虽然需要时间，但从他们的角度来看，结果是值得的。干预者将拥有一个庞大的顺从人群网络，他们的议程可以通过这个网络进行流动。而人们永远不会知道它来自何方。</p>
<p>In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family.</p>
<p>在另一种情况下，情况变得更加复杂。在这里，干预开始展现其更阴暗的一面。并不是每个人都能被轻易安抚。那些不能被干预安抚的人将被干预引导去审判那些反对干预的人。这种情况在拥有极端宗教观点和偏见的人群中尤为明显。这些人会被引导去谴责那些不与他们意见一致的人。事实上，在一些宗教社区中，有些人将会收到这样的讯息：如果敌基督者无法被拯救，他们就必须被消灭，而基督的第二次降临需要对人类大家族进行净化。</p>
<p>There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p>如今，有一些人正在受到这样的引导，尽管他们不一定代表这些宗教社区的领导层，但随着他们的挫败感增加，他们的重视程度会越来越高。他们在等待耶稣的伟大降临，他们认为耶稣的降临之所以没有到来，是因为人类大家族的罪恶，而这种罪恶现在必须被铲除，而不是简单的抵制。而即将到来的耶稣并不是真正的耶稣，而是经过干预者塑造的耶稣。这将是一个他们无法真正识别的假耶稣，因为他们的内识还没有发展。这位耶稣不会带来和平，而是带来清算。这场清算将受到追随者们的欢迎，因为他们自己也充满了怨恨，并相信他们的预言没有实现是因为人类的罪恶，而这些罪恶现在必须被清除，才能将天堂带到地球上。</p>
<p>Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated?</p>
<p>你能暂时看见吗？在这里的大社区存在，干预者，如此善于影响心理环境、对人类的倾向和弱点如此察觉的存在，如何轻易地提供这种影响？你能看到，由于这种操纵，正义之士可能会开始向那些与他们意见不合的人，以及对那些在世界范围内保持内识的人发起战争吗？你可以看到，这种情形是多么容易产生的吗？</p>
<p>Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God’s punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God’s will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done.</p>
<p>甚至那些真正的基督信徒也会成为目标，因为他们不分享这些怨恨，因此他们与那些被干预指挥的人不一致。真正的基督信徒会强调和谐、认知和宽容。但那些受干预指挥的人只想为他们失败的预言复仇。他们希望上帝的惩罚得到执行，他们愿意成为刽子手。他们愿意成为法官和陪审团，执行他们现在认为是上帝旨意的事情。干预组织将如何铲除反对者？如果它获得了足够的力量，你可以看到如何做到这一点。</p>
<p>Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people’s sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged—not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it’s coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust?</p>
<p>在无法实现安抚的地方，干预将影响人们对彼此的敌对行为。随着世界变得更加艰难，随着资源的减少，随着人口的增长，随着竞争的加剧，随着悲剧的频繁发生，人们的宽容心将会减弱，他们的不满情绪将会受到鼓励——不仅仅是通过干预者，当然还有那些有野心并希望自己处于权力位置的人。这多么完美地落入了外星的议程，它试图简化和重组人类的忠诚度。只要能达到这些目的，干预并不在乎他们使用什么宗教。这就是为什么虔诚的基督徒、穆斯林、印度教徒或佛教徒都必须学习内识之路。否则，他们如何能够区分精神上的影响和来自大社区的影响？对于没有辨别能力的人来说，这一切看起来都像是来自更高的地方，来自天国。那么，你能信任谁呢？</p>
<p>The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, “Jesus has come to me.” And the Jesus says, “You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others!” And the zealous follower says, “Yes, Master, yes, Master!”</p>
<p>干预可以创造出美妙的精神场景，激活那些最容易成为其使者的人。它对干预来说并不困难。他们只是上演了一出戏，然后让某人置身其中，而这个人却无法分辨出其中的区别。人们不知道什么是大社区的存在。对他们来说，这一切都来自其他地方，不在他们的层面上，而是来自更高的地方。因此，在某个场景中，一个耶稣的形象被投射给一个狂热者，狂热者会说：“耶稣来到了我的身边。”而耶稣说：“你必须聚集我真正的追随者，你必须谴责所有其他人！”而狂热的追随者会说：“好的，主人，遵命，主人！”</p>
<p>Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people’s religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know.</p>
<p>难以置信？是的。不可能吗？不。如果外星议程的目标是创造一个统一且顺从的人类效忠对象，它必须铲除异己分子，不顺从的分子。他们不会自己动手，因为这样做，每个人都会知道有一个干预行动。相反，他们会让人类以宗教信仰和偏见的名义替他们做这件事。而没有人会知道这一切背后真正的原因。一些人会认为这是撒旦或路西法的所作所为，但他们将不会知道真相。</p>
<p>It is humanity’s ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity’s Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new.</p>
<p>人类的无知是它最大的弱点，而人类的内识则是它最强大的力量。大社区，你们所生活的宇宙，是一个非常复杂的互动环境和影响环境。如果人类继续追随他们的偏见、仇恨和怨恨，无法区分精神影响与大社区影响的区别，那大社区将成为一个极其危险的环境。最终，大社区中的某个种族会将你们赢得到他们的集体或事业中。他们将如何做到这一点？他们会简单地利用你们已经相信的东西，而不是教你们新的东西。</p>
<p>This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people.</p>
<p>这就是为什么学习内识之路是如此重要，因为它教导你关于大社区中的生命和精神性的现实。它教你如何识别操控的本质，以及如何保护自己和他人。它教你如何识别安抚计划的影响和表现，以及今天你能做些什么来增强对这些力量的免疫力，而这些力量对其他人有着如此巨大的影响。</p>
<p>This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction.</p>
<p>这是当今世界的迫切需求。每天都有良知未泯的男人和女人倒在他们无法辨别的说服之下。这是一个渐进的过程。但最终，他们甚至对自己生活中发生的事情一无所知，并敌视任何形式的纠正。</p>
<p>As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies’ message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people’s inability to respond. It’s like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don’t know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, “Well, it’s just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them.”</p>
<p>当你自己开始发展这种大社区觉知，并与他人分享盟友的讯息时，你会看到这种抵制。你会看到人们无法回应。就好像有人拔掉了他们内心深处的插头，现在他们什么都不知道了。如果他们在某种程度上有所回应，他们可能会试图安抚自己。他们会说：“好吧，这只是一种观点，你知道的，我们必须在这种情况下寻找好的一面。我们真的要拥抱这种情况。如果来访者在这里，那他们一定是有目的的，我们必须向这个目的开放自己。也许他们中的一些人是不好的，但一些人是好的，我们必须爱他们才能理解他们。”</p>
<p>This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, “Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all.”</p>
<p>这就是安抚的心理。这是很容易做到的事。只要屈服就可以了。如果幸福是你生命的目标，你就会屈服。你会损害你的完整性。你会否认你自己的焦虑。你会忽略那些告诉你这里有些不对劲的标志、旗帜和线索。你可能会告诉自己：“好吧，这一切只是生活戏剧的一部分，我将凌驾于这一切之上。”</p>
<p>Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing.</p>
<p>纵观当今世界，智者正在退隐，因为干预就在这里。只有少数人处于能够倡导的位置。马歇尔就是其中之一。然而，他需要其他人的帮助。世界还没有丢失，但失去的风险正在增加。</p>
<p>Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it’s not happening.</p>
<p>因此，你不能简单地退隐，去某个乡村过田园生活，远离一切，只是每天过得开心，回归自然，提水、种植、做饭，顺应四季。这种生活已经结束了！如果你要保持意识、自我决定，并拥有自己的完整性，现在没有逃避的余地。没有办法逃进树林假装这一切没有发生。</p>
<p>There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth.</p>
<p>因为不再需要对自我进行持续的治疗。归根结底，唯一真正的治疗是真实地对待你所知道的，为你所知道的真理而站立，学习必要的智慧来承载自己知道的内识，并富有同情心和力量传达自己所知道的内识。这就是任何形式的真正治疗必须导致的结果。你要回到过去，修复你的童年吗？你要去寻找你父母没有给你的不求回报的爱吗？过于关注这些事情的人，会变得残疾。他们在自己的心灵中变成了被轮椅束缚的人。他们都可以成为真理的代言人，但相反，他们所成为的只是治疗的代言人，而今天所做的治疗中，并没有多少是通向真理的。没有逃避。不能以牺牲自己的完整性、知道真理和坚持真理为代价来满足你自己。</p>
<p>Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. “Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone!”</p>
<p>人类必须团结起来，否则将在大社区中被支配。当你思考这一点时，这非常明显。如果来自你世界之外的其他力量想要你们的星球、资源以及人类的效忠，好吧，如果人类大家庭是分裂的，你们实际上是在邀请其他种族进行干预：“当然，来吧！每个种族都有充足的空间！”</p>
<p>Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, “This is what it is!” without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today.</p>
<p>那些抵制干预的人将被指责为不开明和恐惧。有些人会被指责抵制干预是为了保护他们的特殊利益。的确，有些人会为了这些利益而抵制干预。然而，也有一些人会抵制干预，仅仅是因为它是一种干预。但在安抚计划下，谁还能直言不讳地指出这是什么呢？谁能说“这就是问题所在！”而不招致抵抗和谴责？这在今天已经成为一个实际的问题。</p>
<p>We encourage the development of people’s discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about.</p>
<p>我们鼓励人们培养分辨力、谨慎以及运用他们批判性思维的能力。我们在这里鼓励的，不是基于个人的偏见或社会习俗，而是基于内识。内识是你知道的部分。它是造物主赐予你的一种更高心智，用来应对生命中的挑战和机会。它是你内心深处良知的声音。人们常常拿自己的信仰体系互相比较和评判，但这不是我们在这里讨论的内容。</p>
<p>We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it’s facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.</p>
<p>我们在谈论拯救人类，使其免于被奴役的处境。我们正在谈论维护人类的自由和自决，并鼓励人类在来自大社区的力量干预你们的世界时保持完整性。要实现这一点是不可能的吗？嗯，在某种程度上，真理看起来总是不可能的。促进和维护真理的工作看起来总是面临着不可克服的困难，但那只是因为真理没有被足够多的人珍视、认同和深切感受。让人类摆脱这种困境的方法，和摆脱其他任何困境的方法是一样的，那就是面对真理，并采取必要的行动。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who are very uncomfortable because they know that something really wrong is happening. Perhaps they think that their discomfort is just their own psychological problem. Perhaps they think it is a political, economic or environmental problem alone. If they do not have a Greater Community awareness, then they have to focus their attention on something else and look for some other kind of cause. But they know that something is not right about what is happening today. Things don’t feel right. Things are moving in a direction that they should not be moving in. Something is going on that is going to change things, but not in a good way. And the people who feel this are uncomfortable. They wake up with this discomfort; they go to bed with this discomfort. It’s just there. They feel it when they are out in the world. Something is not right.</p>
<p>今天，世界上有很多人感到非常不安，因为他们知道有一些实际错误的事情正在发生。或许他们认为自己的不安只是自身的心理问题，或许他们认为这仅仅是一个政治、经济或环境问题。如果他们没有大社区觉知，他们只能把注意力集中在其他地方，寻找其他的原因。但他们知道，今天发生的事情有些不对劲。事情感觉不对劲。事情正在朝着不应去的方向进行发展。有些事情正在发生，它将改变现状，但不是朝着好的方向发展。而那些感受到这一点的人感到不安。他们带着这种不安醒来，带着这种不安入睡。它一直在那里。即使他们在外面的世界中，他们也能感觉到它。有什么地方不对劲。</p>
<p>Where does this discomfort come from? Why is it there? You can meditate. You can go on vacation. You can have nice food. And you can have moments of delight. But then you return to the discomfort. Something is amiss. It’s not simply because there is poverty or war or deprivation in the world. These have always been with you. Something else is going on here. Something else is really not right.</p>
<p>这种不适感从何而来？为什么会存在？你可以冥想，可以去度假，可以吃美食，也可以体验愉悦的时刻。但随后你又回到了不适的状态。有什么地方出了问题。它不是简单的因为世界上存在贫穷、战争或匮乏。这些问题一直伴随着你们。这里有一些其他的问题，真正不对劲的问题。</p>
<p>Yet you look around and most people are oblivious. They don’t know it. They don’t feel it. And they don’t care. Or they have good excuses. “Well, you know. It’s just human nature,” or “You know, it’s people’s fear. They just need to be more loving.” And you hear really lame excuses for something that is tremendous.</p>
<p>然而，你环顾四周，大多数人对此一无所知。他们不知道它，他们也没有感觉到它，甚至也不关心。或者他们有合理的借口：“好吧，你知道的，这就是人性，”或者“你知道的，这是人们的恐惧，他们只需要更多的爱。”你会听到一些非常蹩脚的借口，来解释一些极大的问题。</p>
<p>Your awareness needs to grow. Your fire needs to grow and become stronger—the fire of truth, the fire of Knowledge. Otherwise, your fire is always snuffed out, extinguished by personal ambivalence, personal fear, personal preference or the kind of listlessness that is the product of the Pacification Program.</p>
<p>你的觉知需要增长。你的火焰需要燃烧得更旺——真理之火，内识之火。否则，你的火焰总是被熄灭，被个人的矛盾心理、个人的恐惧、个人的偏好或安抚计划所产生的无力感所扑灭。</p>
<p>The light of truth must become strong because there are greater forces of darkness here now. The deception is deep and complex. The denial is pervasive, and the acquiescence is pervasive and growing more so every day. Only Knowledge within you can penetrate it.</p>
<p>真理的光芒必须变得强大，因为现在这里有更强大的黑暗力量。欺骗是深刻而复杂的。否认是普遍的，默许也是普遍的，而且每天都在增长。只有你内心深处的内识才能穿透这一切。</p>
<p>Humanity is losing its freedom, slowly but surely, and in such a way that this loss will be very complete because of the cleverness of the agenda behind it. This can happen because of the predispositions of so many people today. This can happen because of the effects of the Pacification Program, which is so well established now in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>人类正在缓慢而肯定地失去自由，而且由于其背后议程的巧妙，这种失去将是非常彻底的。这一切之所以能够发生，是因为如今许多人已经有了这样的倾向。这一切之所以能够发生，也得益于安抚计划的影响，如今在世界许多地方已变得相当稳固。</p>
<p>Therefore, it will take courage and a strong advocacy to activate those people who already feel the discomfort, who already feel the problem but cannot identify it or its source. And it will take a strong advocacy to reach those people who have begun to acquiesce but whose sense of integrity is intact enough that they know that there is a problem within them and around them and who are struggling to maintain their clarity of mind as the fog descends.</p>
<p>因此，需要勇气和强有力的倡导来激活那些已经感觉到不适的人，他们已经感觉到问题，但无法确定问题或问题的根源。它将需要一个强有力的倡导，以接触那些已经开始默许，但他们的正直感还足够完整的人，他们知道在自己的内心深处和周围存在着问题，并在迷雾降临时努力保持着心灵的清晰。</p>
<p>For those who have acquiesced completely, there may be no answer. They may be beyond your reach. It would take a Greater Power, the Angelic Presence, to reach them. But even here, it is quite difficult because the pacification can become so complete that people will think that the very hand of Grace that is trying to rescue them is the very thing they must avoid.</p>
<p>对于那些已经完全默许的人，或许没有答案。他们可能是你无法触及的。需要一种更伟大的力量，即天使的存在，才能触及他们。但即使在这里，它也是相当困难的，因为安抚会变得如此彻底，以至于人们会认为试图拯救他们的恩典之手正是他们必须避免的不适。</p>
<p>You can only reach those who are uncomfortable, who have a sense of knowing that their integrity is being violated and who have begun to feel the persuasion of the Intervention but have not acquiesced to it. There are many people in this camp. You are not speaking to a minority. This advocacy will take time. It is not something that can be done in a few weeks, months or years. It is something that must be continuous.</p>
<p>你只能接触到那些感到不适的人，他们有一种感觉，知道自己的完整性被侵犯了，并已经感受到干预的影响，但仍未屈服。在这个阵营中有许多人。你并不是在对少数人发声。这项倡导需要时间。这不是几周、几个月或几年就能完成的事情。而是必须持续进行的工作。</p>
<p>Humanity’s emergence into the Greater Community will be quite difficult because of the Intervention. It will require that a higher consciousness be cultivated, protected and maintained in enough people. It is going to require a greater level of discernment and discretion, greater care about who you associate with and what you communicate. It is going to require a greater awareness and sensitivity to the world and to those forces who are in the world now casting an influence over humanity.</p>
<p>人类进入大社区的过程将因为干预而变得相当困难。它将要求在足够多的人身上培养、保护和维持一种更高的意识。它将要求更高水平的辨别力和谨慎，更关心你与谁交往，以及你所沟通的内容。它将要求对世界以及那些如今正在世界上施加影响的力量有更大的觉知和敏感性。</p>
<p>Developing this awareness and this sensitivity and establishing one’s personal integrity and relationships that represent this integrity are absolutely fundamental for success. This is what will keep Knowledge alive in the world. This is what will build freedom and keep it alive in the world. This is what will keep humanity intact. For once you lose your integrity and your freedom, it is very difficult to regain them. Very difficult. Even when people have sacrificed their integrity for relationships or for money or for advantage, even under these more normal circumstances, it is very difficult to regain it. You have to mount tremendous effort and take risks. It is easier, then, to stay out of trouble than it is to get out. You do not want to become a prisoner in your own world. You do not want to become a prisoner in your own mind. You do not want to become a prisoner to anyone or anything else.</p>
<p>培养这种觉知和敏感性，建立一个人的完整性，以及代表这种完整性的关系，是成功的绝对基础。这就是内识在世界上保持活力的原因。这就是建立自由并使其在世界中保持活力的原因。这将使人类保持完整。因为一旦你们失去了完整性和自由，就很难再夺回它们。它是极度困难的。即使人们为了关系、为了金钱、为了利益而牺牲了自己的完整性，即使在这些相对正常的情况下，重新获得完整性也非常困难。而再次获得时，必须付出极大的努力以及需要承担的风险。因此，防患于未然要比事后脱身容易得多（远离麻烦比摆脱麻烦更容易）。你不想成为你自己世界中的囚犯。你不想成为你自己心灵中的囚犯。更不希望成为任何人或任何事物的囚徒。</p>
<p>If you could have a Greater Community perspective in these matters, you would recognize that though humanity has great difficulties and serious weaknesses, it is still relatively free in the universe. Of course, living on the surface of your world in isolation, you cannot see this because you do not have the perspective. That is why The Allies Briefings are so valuable, because they give you a perspective that you yourself could not otherwise have. How could you compare yourself to the rest of life in the universe? How could you understand the value of your freedom if you could not see that freedom like this is rare and must be protected well in the Greater Community?</p>
<p>如果你能在这些问题上有一个大社区的视角，你就会认识到，尽管人类有巨大的困难和严重的弱点，但人类在宇宙中仍然是相对自由的。当然，生活在你们世界的表面上，处于孤立的状态下，你们无法看到这一点，因为你们没有这个视角。这也是盟友简报如此珍贵的原因，因为它为你提供了一个你们自身无法拥有的视角。你如何能把自己与宇宙中的其他生命相比较呢？如果你不能看到像这样的自由是稀缺的，而且必须在大社区中得到很好的保护，你怎么能理解你们自由的价值？</p>
<p>This is why the Allies provide a greater perspective. Yet some people will complain, “Well, they do not give us answers. They do not tell us dates and facts and figures and locations.” That is not what is important. It is the understanding, the perspective, the higher consciousness that are critically important. Who cares where the Allies come from? The names of their worlds would be meaningless to you. You are not going to be able to go there for so long! Certainly not in your lifetime. The Allies are providing what is important for you to know about the Greater Community and about the Intervention. They are telling you who is here, why they are here and what they are doing. They are pointing the way to what must be done to counteract this Intervention, which includes the development of Greater Community awareness and a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>这就是为什么盟友提供了一个更大的视角。然而，有些人会抱怨：“他们没有给我们答案。他们没有告诉我们日期、事实、人物和地点。”但这不是关键。真正重要的是理解、视角和更高的意识。谁会在意盟友来自哪里？他们的世界的名字对你来说毫无意义。你们在很长一段时间内肯定无法到达他们的世界！当然，在你的一生中肯定无法实现。盟友为你们提供了关于大社区和干预行动的重要信息。他们告诉你是谁在这里，他们为什么在这里，他们正在做什么。他们指出了抵制干预必须做的事情，其中包括发展大社区觉知和更高的意识。</p>
<p>This development must be emphasized always. It is so vitally important, or people will miss the whole point. They will just assume that this is merely some phenomenal thing that probably isn’t true anyway. Some will say, “These Allies don’t even tell us their names or how they got here.” This is stupidity! If God sends an emissary, do you deny the emissary because he does not answer trivial questions? God has sent the Allies here to help educate humanity and to warn humanity of the grave risks that it faces at this time. Is this going to be denied because some trivial information is not provided?</p>
<p>这种发展的重要性必须时刻被强调。它至关重要，否则人们将错失整个重点。他们只会认为这不过是一些现象级的事情，可能根本不是真的。有些人会说：“这些盟友甚至没有告诉我们他们的名字或他们是如何来到这里的。”这是愚蠢的！如果上帝派遣一位使者，你会因为他没有回答琐碎的问题而否认他吗？上帝派遣盟友来到这里，以帮助和教育人类，并警告人类在这个时期所面临的重大风险。难道因为一些琐碎的信息没有被提供，就要否认这一切吗？</p>
<p>This is why the development of Greater Community awareness is vitally important now. This is why higher consciousness must be promoted and preserved. This is why you keep Knowledge alive in the world. It is this that must be supported and honored at this great turning point.</p>
<p>这就是为什么现在发展大社区觉知是至关重要的。这就是为什么更高的意识必须被促进和维护的原因。这就是为什么你要保持内识在世界中的活力。正是这一点，在这个伟大的转折点必须得到支持和尊重。</p>
<p>Honor this material. Recognize it as being a gift of Grace. Respond to it. Have the courage to do this. Resist the pacification. Resist the influence to become listless and unresponsive to your own Knowledge. Resist the temptation to devote yourself to your own happiness above and beyond everything else. Resist the temptation to attack people of other faiths, cultures or nations. Resist the Intervention through awareness, through advocacy, through understanding. Promote human cooperation, unity and integrity.</p>
<p>尊重这些材料。认识到它是一份恩典的礼物。对它作出回应。要有勇气这样做。抵制安抚的影响。抵制变得无精打采以及对自己的内识变得无动于衷的影响。抵制将自己完全投入追求个人幸福的诱惑。抵制攻击其他信仰、文化或国家的人们的诱惑。通过觉知、倡导和理解来抵制干预。促进人类的合作、团结和完整。</p>
