This is good because these questions must be asked and considered. It is not merely that answers should be readily given, but that the questions be deeply considered and that the questioners think for themselves what the answers could possibly be.</p>
<p>人类的盟友简报将引发许多问题。这是好事，因为这些问题必须被提出并加以深思。它不仅仅是为了给出现成的答案，而是要让这些问题得到深入的思考，让提问者自己去思考答案可能是什么。</p>
<p>If humanity is ever to become strong and self-determined within the Greater Community, then it must have more people who can think independently and critically and consider things deeply.</p>
<p>如果人类要在大社区中变得强大并拥有自主权，那么就必须有更多能够独立思考、批判性思考和深入思考问题的人。</p>
<p>The Allies themselves will remain mysterious. For some people, this will be difficult, but it must be this way, for the Allies really are spying on the Intervention, and to protect themselves, the Allies must remain hidden.</p>
<p>盟友本身将保持神秘。对一些人来说，这将是困难的，但必须如此，因为盟友实际上是在监视干预的行动。为了保护自己，盟友必须保持隐匿状态。</p>
<p>The Allies themselves will not divulge much information about their origin, their identities and so forth. They claim that this information would be meaningless to people, but really the greater reason for this is that the Allies want to maintain their anonymity. This anonymity protects them and their sources.</p>
<p>盟友自己不会透露太多关于他们的起源、身份等信息。他们声称，这些信息对人们来说毫无意义，但实际上更大的原因是盟友想保持他们的匿名性。这种匿名性保护了他们及其信息的来源。</p>
<p>It is perhaps difficult to accept these things at first because people do not understand the difficulties of life in the Greater Community. They do not understand how Knowledge must be transmitted from one race to another, particularly when there is a situation like an Intervention underway. In a manner of speaking, humanity is under siege, though perhaps this seems too strong a word because the activities of the “visitors” seem so subtle and evasive. But given the results of this Intervention, the word “siege” here really is appropriate. If you try to help another nation that is under siege and you want to remain hidden, then you have to protect yourself and your sources and communicate in such a way that the message can be dispensed effectively with minimum risk of the information being destroyed or corrupted in any way.</p>
<p>人们或许一开始难以接受这些事情，因为他们不理解大社区中的生存困境。他们不理解内识必须如何从一个种族传递到另一个种族，特别是当有一个类似干预行动正在进行的情况下。从某种程度上说，人类正处于被围困的境地，尽管这个词可能听起来有些夸张，因为“来访者”的活动显得如此微妙和躲躲闪闪。但从这次干预行动的结果来看，这里使用“围困”一词实际上是恰当的。如果你试图帮助另一个被围困的国家，而你又想保持隐匿，那你就必须保护好自己和你的消息来源，并以能够有效传播讯息的方式进行交流，将信息遭到破坏或损坏的风险降到最低。</p>
<p>This is why the message is being given to one person. If it were given to many people, they could perhaps misinterpret it, and they would have different versions of what they had been given, and then they would contend with each other, and the whole message could be lost or corrupted. As long as this one person can continue to receive the information, and if he has enough support around him, then this is the best protection against misunderstanding and against conflict arising. Since this is information that humanity cannot gain on its own, it must be delivered by those in the Greater Community who are attempting to help you and who are concerned about your freedom in the future.</p>
<p>这就是为什么讯息只传递给一个人的原因。如果传递给许多人，他们可能会误解它，并且每个人会有不同的版本，随后他们之间可能会产生争论，导致整个讯息被遗失或篡改。只要这个人能够继续接收信息，并且他周围有足够的支持，那这就是防止误解和冲突的最好保护措施。由于这是人类无法自行获得的信息，它必须由大社区中那些试图帮助你们的盟友以及关心你们未来自由的种族传递。</p>
<p>How can humanity on its own understand the intricacies of relations in the Greater Community? This is not possible. And if any attempt were made to explain these things, well, it would seem fantastic, and people would have no way of verifying it for themselves, unless of course they were strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>单凭人类自己，如何能够理解大社区中错综复杂的关系？这是不可能的。而且，如果试图解释这些事情，好吧，它就会显得很荒唐，人们没有办法自己去验证这一点，除非他们拥有强大的内识。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Allies will remain mysterious. Some people will understand this. Some people will not understand this. The Allies cannot reveal much about their own history beyond what they have told you in the Briefings. Some people can accept this. Others will become suspicious. But what we are really talking about here is discretion. You do not reveal everything to people at the outset when they can barely understand or accept your initial offerings. Their first questions must go unanswered because they do not have enough trust in their contact, and they do not have enough trust in their own Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence within them, to be able to discern what is true and what is not true.</p>
<p>因此，盟友将保持神秘。有些人会理解这一点，而另一些人则不会理解。盟友无法透露太多关于他们自身历史的细节，除了他们在简报中提到的内容。有些人可以接受这一点，另一些人则会产生怀疑。但我们在这里真正谈论的是谨慎。当人们几乎无法理解或接受你最初的提议时，你不要在一开始就向他们透露一切。他们的首要问题必须暂时得不到解答，因为他们对联系人没有足够的信任，他们对自己的内识、他们内心深处的精神智能也没有足够的信任，无法辨别什么是真实的，什么是虚假的。</p>
<p>Because there is so little honesty in the world, what is truly honest will be suspected and will be considered devious, especially by those who are devious themselves. It is, in fact, very difficult to present something pure to the world without it being defiled or compromised, even at the outset. The one person chosen to receive these messages is chosen because he has no position in the world, because he has no social standing and because he has been well prepared for this. Yes, he will have questions, and he does. Yes, he will be afraid of certain things, and he has been. But as long as he can receive the message and present it in a pure form, whether he himself can fully understand it or not, that is the important thing. Because the message is in a pure form and does not conform to people’s expectations, preferences or beliefs, at the outset not everyone will be able to comprehend it. And there will be much discussion and much suspicion, and many fears will be projected upon it, particularly by people whose previous understanding is challenged in any way by this new revelation.</p>
<p>因为世界上的诚实是如此之少，以至于真正的诚实会被怀疑，并且会被认为是狡诈的，尤其是那些本身狡诈的人。事实上，要把纯洁的讯息呈现给世人而不被玷污或损害是非常困难的，即使是在一开始。这位被选中接收这些讯息的人之所以被选中，是因为他在世上没有任何地位，没有任何社会影响力，而且他为此已做了充分的准备。是的，他会有问题，而且他确实有疑问；是的，他会对某些事情感到害怕，他也一直如此。但只要他能接收讯息并以纯净的形式呈现它，无论他自己能否完全理解，讯息才是最重要的事情。因为讯息是以纯粹的形式传递的，并不符合人们的期望、偏好或信仰，所以在最初，并不是每个人都能理解它。会有许多讨论和猜疑，许多恐惧会被投射到它上面，尤其是那些人的先前理解在任何方面受到这种新启示的挑战时。</p>
<p>Obviously, people would want the Allies to be many things. They would want the Allies to be saviors. They would want the Allies to be rescuers. They would want the Allies to intervene and prevent any other Greater Community force from having access to your world. And people will feel, perhaps, like they have been betrayed or let down because the Allies are not here to protect humanity. But think about this. If the Allies were here to protect humanity, they would have to continue to protect humanity, which would require them, in effect, to take control of your world. All governments in your world would then have to be coordinated with the activities of the Allies. This then would lead to your loss of freedom, even loss of freedom to a friend.</p>
<p>显然，人们希望盟友能扮演许多角色。他们会希望盟友成为救世主，他们会希望盟友成为救援者，他们会希望盟友进行干预，阻止任何其他大社区的力量进入你们的世界。人们可能会觉得他们被背叛了，或者被辜负了，因为盟友并不是来保护人类的。但请仔细想一想。如果盟友是来保护人类的，他们将不得不继续保护人类，这将要求他们，实际上，控制你们的世界。所有的政府将不得不与盟友的行动协调一致。这样就会导致你们失去自由，甚至是失去对朋友的自由。</p>
<p>It is not the Allies’ purpose to circumvent human authority. It is not their purpose to change governments or allegiances between nations. Their purpose is only to observe the Intervention and to deliver their commentaries. If you want someone to save you, you will give them your power to do so. The Allies will not accept this. And even if they mounted a force necessary to eject the visitors who are interfering in human affairs, to end the Intervention, well, you would have warfare at your borders. And even the Allies’ home worlds would be threatened because they are here without any official permission from other worlds or from trading unions or anything like this. What we mean by this is that the Allies are really not supposed to be here doing what they are doing. If you think about this, you will understand. Even in your world, your governments have secret agents trying to get information, trying to intervene in certain ways, either for good or for ill.</p>
<p>盟友的目的不是绕过人类的权威。他们的目的不是改变政府或国家之间的效忠关系。他们的目的只是观察干预并传递他们的评述。如果你希望某个种族来拯救你们，你就会把你们的力量交给他们。盟友不会接受这一点。即使他们组建了一支必要的力量来驱逐干预人类事务的来访者，以结束干预，好吧，你们的边界就会发生战争。甚至盟友的家园世界也将受到威胁，因为他们在这里的行动并未得到任何其他世界或贸易联盟的官方许可。我们的意思是，盟友并不应该在这里做他们正在做的事情。如果你仔细思考这一点，你就会理解。即使在你们的世界里，各国政府也有秘密特工，试图获取信息，或以某种方式进行干预，不论是为了善意还是恶意。</p>
<p>The only thing that is going to save humanity is humanity itself. And for this to be possible, humanity must have a greater understanding and take a very sober and objective approach to life in the universe. As it is now, generally speaking, most people take a very romantic view of life in the universe. They are dazzled by technology and want more. They think “contact” will bring them untold benefits. They think that advanced nations will teach humanity how to live in peace, how to maintain the environment and how to elevate the standard of living for people everywhere.</p>
<p>唯一能拯救人类的是人类本身。为了做到这一点，人类必须拥有更大的理解，并采取一种非常冷静和客观的态度来看待宇宙中的生命。就目前而言，总体上大多数人对宇宙中的生命抱有非常浪漫的看法。他们被科技所吸引，渴望更多。他们认为“接触”会给他们带来难以计数的益处。他们认为先进的文明将教导人类如何在和平中生活，如何维护环境，如何提高各地人民的生活水平。</p>
<p>Think about this. Is this possible? Do you think people want to have their lives changed and controlled by unknown forces? The visitors may promise these things because it feeds right into people’s expectations and desires. The visitors tell people, “Oh, of course, we will give you peace and equanimity. We have no war.” Do you wish to give over the authority of your life and have your life and circumstances completely controlled for a mere promise of greater technology or a promise of peace and equanimity in the world? There is peace in the prison because everyone is controlled. But is this really peace? Or is this simply the restraint of war?</p>
<p>思考这个问题，这是可能的吗？你认为人们真的愿意让他们的生活被未知的力量改变和控制吗？来访者可能会承诺这些事情，因为这正好迎合了人们的期望和渴望。来访者告诉人们，“哦，当然，我们会带给你们和平与平等。我们没有战争。”你真的愿意为了得到更先进的科技，或为了得到一个关于世界和平与平等的承诺，而将你们的生命和处境完全交给他人来控制吗？在监狱里是有和平的，因为每个人都受到控制。但这是真正的和平吗？还是简单的对战争的限制？</p>
<p>Then there are people in the world whose financial positions will be threatened by the Intervention, and they will either resist the Intervention to protect their wealth and their privileges, or they will attempt to unite with the Intervention for their own benefit. Their uniting with the Intervention represents a very dangerous scenario, and one must be quite sober and objective to deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>接下来，世界上会有一些人的财务状况将因干预而受到威胁，他们要么会抵制干预以保护他们的财富和特权，要么会试图与干预联合起来谋取个人的利益。他们与干预的联合代表着一种非常危险的局面，人们必须保持清醒和客观的态度，才能有效应对。</p>
<p>Many people will simply go into denial and say, “Well, this can’t possibly be! I don’t believe this. Advanced civilizations don’t behave like this. And if they are here, they could help us, and we should welcome them!”</p>
<p>许多人会简单地否认现实，说：“好吧，这不可能是真的！我不相信这个。先进的文明不会有这样的行为。如果他们真的在这里，他们会帮助我们，我们应该欢迎他们！”</p>
<p>And of course there are many people who simply cannot even consider these things because the reality of the Intervention is beyond their range of comprehension entirely. Life in the universe? Well, fine, maybe at the far ends of the galaxy, but not here!</p>
<p>当然，还有许多人甚至根本无法考虑这些事情，因为干预的现实完全超出了他们的理解范围。宇宙中的生命？好吧，也许在遥远的银河系，但不是在这里！</p>
<p>And then there will be people who will say, “Oh, these Allies are right! We have to defend ourselves! Let’s build bunkers and live underground and store up weapons and mistrust everyone and everything.”</p>
<p>然后会有一些人说：”哦，这些盟友是对的！我们必须保卫自己！让我们建造防空洞吧，住在地下，囤积武器，对每个人和所有事物都不信任。</p>
<p>So, it is possible that The Allies Briefings may create some hysteria. It is certain there will be denial. It is certain they will be condemned and attacked by people from different viewpoints. But this is the risk that must be taken when a vital message is delivered, into your world or into any world.</p>
<p>因此，盟友的简报可能会造成一些歇斯底里的情绪。可以肯定的是，会有否认的声音。可以肯定的是，盟友肯定会受到不同观点的人的谴责和攻击。但是，当一个重要讯息被传递到你们的世界或任何世界时，这种风险是必须承担的。</p>
<p>Can the truth be received here without anxiety and condemnation? Well, look at the history of the great Spiritual Teachers who have become public with their messages. That gives you a very good demonstration. A few people are reached, and many are outraged. There will be outrage over The Allies Briefings, but a few people will be reached, and they will be able to reach other people. And over time, a new understanding and awareness will slowly work its way into the human consciousness. This awareness is vitally important, for humanity is grossly unprepared for the Greater Community, so unprepared, in fact, that the situation has become rather desperate. Something has to be done or humanity will give away the keys to the kingdom freely, openly, with very little question.</p>
<p>在这里，真理能在没有焦虑和谴责的情况下被接收吗？看看那些伟大的精神导师公开传递讯息的历史吧。这给了你一个非常好的示范。少数人被触及，许多人被激怒。对于盟友的简报，也会有人感到愤怒，但少数人会被触及，他们将能够触及其他人。随着时间的推移，一种新的理解和觉知将慢慢进入人类的意识中。这种觉知极为重要，因为人类对大社区的准备是极度缺乏的，事实上，如此缺乏准备，情况已经到了相当绝望的地步。如果不采取行动，人类将毫无疑问、轻易地、几乎没有质疑地拱手让出自己世界的钥匙。</p>
<p>Look at the history of the peoples of your world, the native peoples of the world, those who simply acquiesced and said, “Oh, yes, fine. Welcome. Move on in. We’ll live here, and you can live over there, and everything will be fine.” Look what happened here. Is this new scenario really very different? It is a very difficult situation to be the race that is discovered, to be the natives of a new world, being visited by others who seek the values and wealth and opportunities of the new world. Such is the predicament that humanity is in now.</p>
<p>看看你们世界人民的历史，看看世界原住民的历史，看看那些只是默许并说：“哦，是的，没有问题。欢迎到来。搬进来吧。我们住在这里，而你可以住在那里，一切都会好起来的”看看这里发生了什么。这个新的情景真的非常不同吗？作为被发现的种族，作为新世界的原住民，被其他寻求新世界的价值、财富和机遇的种族所拜访，这是一个非常困难的局面。这就是人类目前所处的困境。</p>
<p>Yet is this a great tragedy? It could become a great tragedy, depending on how people respond. However, it is also a great opportunity, for the presence of forces from the Greater Community intervening into human affairs is really the one great chance for humanity to unite itself and to become strong in its own defense. It takes something of this magnitude to overcome the tribal animosities and histories between cultures. It takes something greater, a greater problem, to unite people.</p>
<p>然而，这是一场巨大的悲剧吗？这可能会成为一场巨大的悲剧，这取决于人们如何应对。然而，这也是一个伟大的机会，因为来自大社区的力量干预人类事务的存在，实际上是人类团结起来并在自身的防御中变得强大的伟大机会。只有这样规模的挑战，才能克服部落之间的仇恨和文化之间的历史积怨。人类需要更大的问题，才能使人们团结起来。</p>
<p>It is like being in a house on fire. If people in one room won’t speak to people in another room, and the people upstairs hate the people downstairs, and the house is on fire, well, you either help each other, or you perish! The world is like a house on fire. It is on fire through environmental degradation and through increasing conflicts between nations and cultures. But the greater fire in the world is the presence of the visitors. The greater fire is the Intervention.</p>
<p>它就像住在一幢着火的房子里。如果一个房间的人不愿意和另一个房间的人说话，楼上的人讨厌楼下的人，而房子正在着火，好吧，你们要么互相帮助，要么一起灭亡！世界就像一套着火的房子。它因环境恶化和国家与文化之间日益增加的冲突而着火。但世界上的大火是来访者的存在，是干预。</p>
<p>Humanity can deal with these other problems though it has not done so sufficiently yet. But can it deal with the presence of those from beyond the world who possess skills that humanity has not yet cultivated? You can clean up your own backyard. You can change the structure of government. You can slowly, with great difficulty, bring greater justice into the world, and indeed this must be done. But can you deal with the reality of intelligent life from beyond your world without romance, without hopeful expectation, without greed? Can you deal with this objectively and honestly? Can you say to the visitors, “All right, if you are here, then you must reveal yourselves and your intentions, and we will determine if you have a right to be here or not!”</p>
<p>人类可以处理这些其他问题，尽管目前还没有充分做到。但是，人类能应对那些来自世界之外、拥有人类尚未培养的技能的集体存在吗？你们可以清理自己的后院，可以改变政府的结构，你可以慢慢地，非常困难地把更大的正义带入世界，而且确实必须这样做。但是，你能不带浪漫、不带希望、不带贪婪地对待来自你们世界之外的智能生命的现实吗？你能客观、诚实地对待这个问题吗？你能否对这些来访者说：“好吧，如果你们在这里，那你们必须表明自己以及你们的意图，我们将决定你们是否有权利待在这里！”</p>
<p>As the Allies describe in their Briefings, humanity should not let any foreign race upon its soil without permission from the population. Obviously, under current circumstances, this permission was never asked for and never granted. That is why it is an Intervention and not a visitation. Visitors are welcomed in. They have asked permission to visit. They are here on a visit, with the permission of those being visited. But an Intervention does not have this permission. It is forced upon you. Some people may say, “Perhaps the visitors did ask for permission, and it was denied by the governments of the world.” Well, even if this were the case, the visitors should be on their way and not be here. Even if the governments of the world made a mistake in not welcoming the visitation, if it was not welcomed, then the visitors should not be here—unless they came to conquer and to intervene for this purpose.</p>
<p>正如盟友的简报中所描述的，人类不应允许任何外来种族在未经民众许可的情况下进入它的领土。显然，在目前的情况下，这种许可从未被请求，也从未被授予。这就是为什么这是一场干预而不是一次访问。来访者是被欢迎进入的，他们请求了许可并得到了被访问者的同意。而干预则没有得到这种许可。它是强加给你们的。有些人可能会说：“也许这些来访者确实请求了许可，但被世界政府拒绝了。”即便如此，来访者也应该离开，而不是留在这里。即便世界各国政府犯了错误，没有欢迎他们，如果没有被欢迎，来访者就不应留在这里——除非他们是为了征服或为此目进行的干预。</p>
<p>Why else would they be here and getting so involved in human affairs, taking such great interest in human physiology, psychology and religion? Do you think they are lacking these things and that is why they are visiting? Do you think they are going to steal the books out of your library? They could get all this information simply by being observers and collecting all of your data and information and transmissions and so forth. They would not need to be here interfering in human affairs to learn about you. Some people think, “Well, they need our reproductive abilities. Or they need our spirituality. Or they need our emotions. Or they need our religion.” This is all foolishness. This is turning a blind eye to the obvious.</p>
<p>否则他们为什么会在这里，为什么如此深入地参与人类事务，为什么对人类的生理、心理和宗教如此感兴趣？你认为他们缺乏这些东西，这就是他们来访的原因吗？你认为他们会从你们的图书馆里偷走书籍吗？他们可以通过观察、收集你们的数据信息和传输内容等方式获得所有这些信息。他们不需要深入干预人类事务就能了解你们。有些人认为：“好吧，他们需要我们的生育能力，或者他们需要我们的精神性，或者他们需要我们的情感，或者他们需要我们的宗教。”这些都是愚蠢的想法，这是对显而易见事实的视而不见。</p>
<p>Why do nations intervene with one another? Think about this. It is no different in the Greater Community. The obvious is being missed. People want to think of it in other ways because it is easier to deal with. For goodness sakes, yes! Some people say, “Oh, they are here because they need our help! They need our blood supplies. Or they need our religion and we will help them and we will feel so good about ourselves and they will be so grateful.”</p>
<p>为什么国家之间要相互干预？想一想这个问题。在大社区中情况并无不同。显而易见的事情被忽视了。人们想以其他方式来看待这件事，因为这样更容易处理。看在上帝的份上，确实如此！有些人说：“哦，他们来到这里是因为他们需要我们的帮助！他们需要我们的血液，或者他们需要我们的宗教，我们会帮助他们，我们会因此感觉良好，他们会非常感激我们。”</p>
<p>Some people think, “Well, they are here to bring us new technology and help us end pollution.” Do you think people and governments would use this new technology in such a way? Nations in the world would step upon each other to have this new technology for superiority and strength because nations are competing with each other.</p>
<p>有些人认为：“好吧，他们在这里为我们带来了新的技术，帮助我们结束污染。”你认为各国政府会以这种方式使用这些新技术吗？世界上的国家会为了拥有这项新技术而相互践踏，以获得优势和力量，因为国家之间是相互竞争的。</p>
<p>Some people say, “Well, they are here because they want to study us.” Why would they want to study you? They could study you by receiving your transmissions, which are being projected out into space. Your information is very accessible. It does not require them to be here to study you. And why would they want to study you anyway? Why would so much time and effort be spent in studying human beings? Do you think this is a science project? Do you think this is a cultural exploration? Do people think that humanity is so fascinating, so marvelous and so remarkable that other races would spend this kind of time studying you?</p>
<p>有些人会说：“好吧，他们在这里是因为他们想要研究我们。”他们为什么要研究你们？他们可以通过接收你们的传输信息来研究你们，这些信息正被投射到太空。你们的信息非常容易获取，他们不需要亲自来到这里来研究你们。而且，他们为什么要研究你们？他们为什么要花费如此多的时间和精力来研究人类？你认为这是一个科学项目吗？你认为这是一场文化探索吗？人们认为人类是如此令人着迷、如此非凡和卓越，以至于其他种族会花费如此多的时间来研究你们吗？</p>
<p>The only reason that races are studied is for economic or political advantage in the Greater Community. And these races are studied without their permission. Would you want someone to say, “We would like to study you. Would you be our laboratory experiment for the rest of your life? We will try not to harm you.” Would you agree to that? Especially if you found out that you were being used in order for your investigators to take advantage of everything you are and everything you have? Many people think, “Well, the visitors are here to help us,” but really they are here to help themselves. And people are making it very easy for them to do this.</p>
<p>研究种族的唯一原因是在大社区中获得经济优势或政治优势。而这些种族是未经许可进行研究的。你会希望有人对你说：“我们想要研究你。你愿意成为我们终生的实验对象吗？我们会尽量不伤害你。”你会同意这样做吗？特别是如果你发现自己被利用，只是为了让调查者利用你的一切和你所拥有的一切？许多人认为：“来访者是来帮助我们的。”但实际上，他们是来帮助他们自己的。而人们正在让他们很容易地做到这一点。</p>
<p>So you might ask, “Well, why aren’t more people aware of this?” The answer to that is difficult because it deals with several different factors. The first is people’s cultural conditioning and religious conditioning that really do not allow for the reality of intelligent life in the universe, regardless of their perhaps liberal views on the subject. When it comes right down to it, there is no place in human awareness for life in the universe, unless it is at the level of a primitive life form, of course. A piece of bacteria is fine. An intelligent race intervening in human affairs is not fine.</p>
<p>所以你可能会问：“好吧，为什么没有更多的人察觉到这一点？”这个问题的答案是复杂的，因为它涉及到几个不同的因素。首先是人们的文化条件和宗教条件中，这些条件实际上并不允许宇宙中存在智能生命的现实，尽管有些人可能对这个话题持开放的态度。归根结底，在人类的觉知中，除非是原始生命形式，比如细菌，否则在人类觉知中没有为宇宙中的生命留出位置。细菌是可以接受的，而智能种族干预人类事务则不会被接受。</p>
<p>The governments of the world will not reveal what they know because they have no defense. And the defenses they do have they cannot fully employ without notifying the public, and they do not trust the public, their own populations, to support such an effort without going into panic. Would the government of your country publicly announce, “We have an Intervention going on from races beyond the world. We don’t really understand their technology. We are not sure of all of their activities. And we have no defense against them”?</p>
<p>世界各国政府不会透露他们所知道的事情，因为他们没有防御措施。而他们所拥有的防御措施在不通知公众的情况下无法完全使用，而且他们不信任自己的人民会在没有恐慌的情况下支持这样的努力。你们国家的政府是否会公开宣布：“我们正在经历来自外星种族的干预。我们并不真正理解他们的技术。我们不清楚他们的所有活动。而且我们对他们没有任何防御措施？”</p>
<p>People think they should be told, but most people could not handle it. They could not take it in. They would run and try to hide somewhere. They would think the end of the world was at hand.</p>
<p>人们认为应该被告知，但大多数人无法承受这样的消息。他们无法接受，他们会逃跑，试图躲藏起来。他们会认为世界末日即将来临。</p>
<p>There are people who are aware of the Intervention but say, “Well, we must be very careful not to come to any premature conclusions here. I mean, we have to gather more facts. We need more evidence.” Really? For what? Can’t you just see this and know this for what it is? Are you going to spend the rest of your life piecing it together in little tiny pieces? This is not a science experiment. This is the interaction between life forms!</p>
<p>有些人察觉到干预的存在，但他们说：“好吧，我们必须非常小心，不要过早得出结论。我的意思是，我们必须收集更多的事实。我们需要更多的证据。”真的吗？还需要什么证据？难道你不能就此看清真相吗？你要花一生的时间去一点点拼凑这个真相吗？这不是一场科学实验，这是生命形式之间的互动！</p>
<p>If you were diagnosed with a serious illness, would you want to become part of a laboratory experiment? Or would you want to get cured? You would likely want a path of healing established as soon as possible, and if you were sincere about relieving yourself of your illness, you would give it all of your attention. But certain people treat the Intervention as if it were a science experiment, and they are going to take a very long time and piece it all together, and they don’t want to be wrong. Meanwhile, their world is being undermined right underneath their feet. They don’t know it, and they don’t see it, and they don’t want to come to these conclusions because they seem unscientific, and they seem outrageous, and where is the proof? And what is proof? How much do you have to see before it is clear? Given the clandestine nature of the Intervention, well, not much is being shown to people. Not in broad daylight anyway.</p>
<p>如果你被诊断出患有严重疾病，你会想成为实验对象吗？还是想治愈疾病？你可能会希望尽快找到一条治愈的道路，如果你真心想要摆脱疾病，你会把所有的注意力都放在治愈上。但某些人却把干预当作一场科学实验，他们会花很长时间一点点拼凑真相，他们不想出错。与此同时，他们的世界正在他们的脚下遭到破坏。他们不知道，他们也没有看到，他们不想得出这些结论，因为它们看起来是不科学的，而且很离谱，证据在哪里？而什么是证据呢？你还需要看到多少才能看清真相？鉴于干预的秘密性质，好吧，事实并没有向人们展示，至少不会在光天化日之下。</p>
<p>So, attempting to be scientific, you piece it together, and you are on the path of seeking the truth, and you don’t get the truth, and you haven’t gotten the truth, and you won’t get the truth. And you are ambivalent about getting the truth because if you really see what it is, well, your science experiment is over. And now you must really act! You must really do something! And your colleagues will look at you like you are crazy, like you have lost your mind, like you have given up your reason and objectivity and taken a wild and outrageous position. So, as much as the truth is sought, at least in theory, it is denied, and no one wants to take the risk of knowing anything. This is a very hard thing to come to terms with, by the way. We understand this. This may be the hardest thing you have ever come to terms with, other than your own mortality.</p>
<p>所以，为了科学起见，你把它拼凑起来，踏上了寻求真相的道路，然而你没有得到真相，你从未得到过真相，而且你也不会得到真相。你对于得到真相的态度是模棱两可的，因为如果你真的看清楚了它的真相，那么你的科学实验就结束了。而现在你必须真正地行动起来！你必须真正地做一些事情！而你的同事们会觉得你疯了，觉得你失去了理智，认为你放弃了理性和客观，采取了一种疯狂而离奇的立场。所以，尽管理论上追求真相，但实际上它被否认了，没有人愿意冒险去知道任何事情。顺便说一句，这是一件非常难以接受的事情。我们理解这一点。除了接受自己的终有一死之外，这可能是你所面对的最艰难的事情。</p>
<p>We don’t expect people to simply accept this at first notice. But we must address those tendencies, beliefs and attitudes that prevent people from knowing this at any time. You don’t want to wait for the proof because then it will be too late. By then, there will be very little recourse.</p>
<p>我们并不期望人们在首次接触这个信息时就简单接受。但我们必须解决那些阻碍人们随时知道这一点的倾向、信念和态度。你不想等待证据，因为到那时将为时已晚。到了那时，几乎没有任何补救的余地。</p>
<p>Then people will say, “Well, the visitors have really taken over everything now. I guess it means that’s why they’re here!” And what do you do then? Protest? Write letters to your senator? Complain to your friends? This is a very serious situation. People must take risks here to see and to know. But even in taking risks, you need some help because you cannot see what is beyond your borders.</p>
<p>然后人们会说：“好吧，来访者现在实际上已经接管了一切。我想这就是他们来到这里的原因！”那时你会做什么呢？抗议？给你的参议员写信？向你的朋友抱怨？这是一个非常严肃的情况。人们必须在这里冒险去看清和知道。但是，即使是冒险，你也需要一些帮助，因为你无法看到你们边界之外的生命。</p>
<p>Could the Native American peoples understand the intricacies and competition between European nations? No, they could not. Not without help from a more mysterious source. And indeed at that time, the Angelic Presence was active in trying to notify the peoples of the Americas that great and tragic changes were coming. But like yourselves, the Natives could not respond because it was outside the realm of their world view. It did not fit with their beliefs or understanding, and so such revelations, to the extent they could be made available to people, were largely rejected or ignored. Do you think that the Angelic Presence just looked the other way and let the Native American peoples be obliterated?</p>
<p>美洲原住民能理解欧洲各国之间的复杂关系和竞争吗？不，他们不能。如果没有一个更神秘的来源的帮助，他们无法做到。而事实上，在那个时候，天使的存在一直在试图通知美洲人民巨大的、悲剧性的变化即将到来。但就像你们一样，原住民们无法回应，因为这超出了他们的世界观范畴。这不符合他们的信仰或理解，因此这些启示，即使可以提供给他们，也大多被拒绝或忽视。你认为天使的存在会视而不见，让美洲原住民被消灭吗？</p>
<p>People want things to work out well. They want to be comfortable. And so they do not look, and if they look, they do not see, and if they see, they do not comprehend because of what they want. People do not want war, and, as a result, they deny war until war overtakes them. Instead of eradicating the conflict at the very outset, as soon as the spark is lit, they wait for the fire to reach them, and then they say, “Oh, we have to stop this!”</p>
<p>人们希望事情能顺利进行。他们希望自己是舒适的。因此他们不会去看，即使看了，他们也看不到，即使看到了，他们也不会理解，因为他们被自己的欲望蒙蔽了双眼。人们不想要战争，结果他们否认战争的存在，直到战争席卷而来。在冲突刚刚萌芽时，他们本可以根除它，而他们却等到火焰烧到自己时才说：“哦，我们必须阻止这场战争！”</p>
<p>People ask, “Well, what can we really do?” There is a great deal you can really do. You must begin with awareness. You must have an understanding of what you are dealing with. You must not allow any alien force to set foot on the soil of this world without the express permission from the people of your world. You have these rights. You must exercise them.</p>
<p>人们问：“好吧，我们实际可以做些什么呢？”你真的可以做很多事情。你必须从觉知开始。你必须理解你正在面对什么。你绝不能允许任何外星力量在没有获得你们世界人民明确许可的情况下踏上这个星球的土地。这是你的权利，你必须行使这些权利。</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to take a very prosaic view of life in the universe. Look up at the stars. They are physical. This is not the Heavens you are looking at. This is not your heavenly state. Everyone in the universe, living in physical life, must deal with the rigors of physical life—survival, competition, hardship, deprivation. Technology does not end these requirements and these difficulties. In fact, it can make things even more complicated. It solves some problems and creates others.</p>
<p>在这里，有必要对宇宙中的生命采取一种非常平淡的看法。抬头看看星星。它们是物质存在的。这不是你正在看的天堂。这不是你的天国状态。宇宙中每一个在物质世界中生活的生命，都必须应对物质生命的严峻考验——生存、竞争、困难、匮乏。技术并没有终结这些需求和困难。事实上，它可以使生活变得更加复杂。它解决了一些问题，却又制造了新的问题。</p>
<p>You must have an adult view of life in the universe. If you have an adolescent view, you are not going to understand. And your lack of comprehension could truly be tragic. The awareness must be established. This is the purpose of The Allies Briefings—to establish the awareness, not to answer every question, not to give you a complete understanding, but to give you an awareness. Gaining an awareness is being alerted to something. It does not mean all your questions regarding it are answered or even addressed. But it does mean you are aware of something.</p>
<p>你必须对宇宙中的生命有一个成年人的视角。如果你用青少年的视角，你是不会理解的。而你的理解不足可能会导致真正的悲剧。必须建立觉知。这就是盟友简报的目的——建立觉知，而不是回答每一个问题，也不是给你一个完整的理解，而是让你有一种觉知。获得觉知意味着你察觉到了某些事情。这并不意味着所有与你相关的问题都会得到解答，甚至是解决。但它确实意味着你察觉到了一些事情。</p>
<p>The Allies’ message is very simple and very short, and in many ways very general because it is here to arouse awareness and to correct misunderstanding. That is its purpose. Beyond this awareness, there must be a development in spiritual understanding, an awareness of the mental environment and the willingness to establish greater cooperation between nations and cultures.</p>
<p>盟友的讯息非常简单，非常简短，而且在许多方面非常笼统，因为它的目的是唤起觉知，并纠正错误的理解。这就是它的目的。除了这种觉知之外，还必须发展精神上的理解，必须提高对心理环境的觉知，并愿意在国家和文化之间建立更大的合作。</p>
<p>This is a worldwide problem. It is not a problem for Americans or British or Chinese. It is a worldwide phenomenon. The Intervention does not prize one race over another, except insofar as one race can help achieve the intentions of those who are intervening. In this, there is much emphasis on America because it is the most powerful, influential nation. But this is a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
<p>这是一个世界性的问题。它不是美国人、英国人或中国人的问题。它是一个世界性的现象。干预并没有将某个种族置于另一个种族之上，除非某个种族能够帮助实现干预者的意图。在这一点上，美国备受重视，因为它是最强大、最有影响力的国家。但这是一个世界性的现象。</p>
<p>You as human beings are being challenged. Your right to be here, your right to be free and self-determined in the universe, is being challenged. Those who are intervening in human affairs believe that you cannot rule yourselves and that you will destroy the world, and so they feel that it is their right and privilege to intervene. Their attitude is, “Well, these human beings! Look at them! They are like animals! We will bring order and structure here.” And some people will think, “Oh, that is wonderful! Finally, we will have order and structure.”</p>
<p>你们作为人类正在受到挑战。你们的生存权、你们在宇宙中自由和自决的权利正在受到挑战。那些干预人类事务的集体认为你们无法统治自己，认为你们会摧毁这个世界，因此他们认为自己有权利和特权来干预。他们的态度是：“瞧，这些人类！看看他们吧！他们像动物一样！我们将带来秩序和结构。”而有些人会想：“哦，这太好了！终于，我们有了秩序和结构。”</p>
<p>Do you really want order and structure imposed upon you in this way and to this degree? This is not the way that humanity will advance or become elevated. This is not the way humanity will establish cooperation and peace within the world. Do you want to be occupied? Because that is what you are facing. A vast, global occupation. And many people will say, “Well, I just can’t deal with this. I have other problems.” We say, “What other problems do you have that are more important than this?” Yes, there are other things in everyone’s life that must be dealt with and resolved, but not at the expense of this awareness. This is the most important awareness that one can have in life, in this world, at this time.</p>
<p>你真的想要这样的秩序和结构强加在你们身上吗？这不是人类进步或提升的方式。这不是人类在世界内建立合作与和平的方式。你们想被占领吗？因为这就是你们面临的：一次大规模的全球占领。而许多人会说：“好吧，我只是无法面对这个问题。我还有其他的问题要处理。”我们说：“还有什么问题比这更重要呢？”是的，每个人的生活中确实有其他事情需要处理和解决，但不能以牺牲这种觉知为代价。这是一个人在生命中、在这个世界上、在这个时候能够拥有的最重要的觉知。</p>
<p>So, you begin with awareness, and then you must study and learn things about life in the universe. And where can you learn this? At the university? In church? From your parents? From your friends? From the newspaper? Or a magazine? What teaches you about life in the universe can be learned in part from human history. The understanding of how the world has evolved, and the forces that have shaped it, and how nations have interacted with each other will teach you a great deal about life in the universe because it is not different. It is only happening on a much greater scale with many more different influences and participants. You need a very sober view of intelligent life in the universe. And you must understand, counter to what is believed by many today, that technology will not save you. It will only change you. Technology has not saved any race in the universe. It has only changed them.</p>
<p>因此，你要从觉知开始，然后你必须研究和学习关于宇宙中的生命的教导。你能在哪里学习这些？在大学里？在教堂里？从你的父母那里？从你的朋友那里？从报纸上？或是杂志？关于宇宙中生命的理解，部分可以从人类历史中学到。理解世界是如何演变的，以及塑造它的力量，国家之间如何互动，会让你对宇宙中的生命有很大的了解，因为这并没有太大的不同。它只是在一个更大的规模上发生，有更多不同的影响和参与者。你需要对宇宙中智能生命有一个非常清醒的看法。你还必须理解，与当今许多人所相信的相反，技术不会拯救你们。它只会改变你们。技术并没有拯救宇宙中的任何种族，它只是改变了他们。</p>
<p>Yes, there are nations that can overwhelm and dominate others because of technology. But these invading nations have been changed themselves by technology. Technology actually makes you vulnerable in the Greater Community. If you have technology that no one else has, well, everyone wants what you have now. And how are you going to defend what you have and protect what you have? It is a problem that very wealthy people face even in your world. How are they going to protect their wealth and their privilege? This totally changes their lives, their friends, their priorities, and can indeed make their lives truly miserable, and often does.</p>
<p>是的，有些国家因为技术而可以压倒和统治其他国家。但这些入侵的国家本身也被技术改变了。在大社区中，技术实际上使你们变得脆弱。如果你们拥有其他种族没有的技术，那现在每个种族都想要你们所拥有的技术。你们又如何捍卫和保护自己所拥有的技术呢？即使在你们的世界里，非常富有的人也会面临这个问题。他们如何保护自己的财富和特权？这完全改变了他们的生活、他们的朋友、他们的优先事项，并且确实会让他们的生活变得非常痛苦，而这种情况经常发生。</p>
<p>The best position in the Greater Community is to be self-sufficient, independent and extremely discreet. This is wisdom on a greater scale. Yet you can understand from human culture and your own history how this can be true and why this is true. Does the person who just won a million dollars go out and tell everybody? Well, things will change if they do. Discretion, discernment. Very important. More important now than ever before.</p>
<p>在大社区中，最好的处境是自给自足、独立自主、极其谨慎。这是在更大范围内的智慧。然而，你可以从人类的文化和你自己的历史中理解这为何是真实的，以及为什么真实。一个刚刚赢得百万美元的人会出去告诉所有人吗？如果他们这么做，事情会发生变化。谨慎，明辨是非。非常重要，现在比以往任何时候都更加重要。</p>
<p>Therefore, a great deal can be learned from your own history. You take an objective view and say, “Well, this is what happens when nations of different capabilities interact.”</p>
<p>因此，你可以从你们自己的历史中学到很多。你可以客观地看待，并说：“好吧，这就是不同能力的国家互动时发生的事情。”</p>
<p>Yet many people still think, “It’s manifest destiny. It must be this way. It’s the way it is. And it can’t be changed. And it would have happened this way anyway.” That is ridiculous! It could have happened in many different ways. It could have gone many different ways. History did not have to turn out the way it did. And there are other people in the world who think, “Well, whatever happens is the right thing to happen.” This is even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>然而，许多人仍然认为，“它是显现的天命。事情必须这样发生。它就是这样的，无法改变。无论如何，它都会以这种方式发生。”这是荒谬的！事情可能会以不同的方式发生。它可以有许多不同的方式。历史不一定会变成这样。而世界上还有一些人认为：“瞧，无论发生什么，都是正确的。”这就更荒谬了。</p>
<p>Yet while much may be learned by studying human history, culture and psychology, there must be new information as well, a new perspective. It is not simply new information you need as much as a larger perspective. If you look at things the way you have always looked at them, you are going to see what you have always seen. And nothing new is going to be revealed. So, to have a new understanding, a new revelation, requires a different perspective. Otherwise, the mind simply protects what it already believes in and fends off or fights off anything that challenges that.</p>
<p>然而，虽然通过研究人类历史、文化和心理学可以学到很多，但也必须有新的信息和新的视角。你需要的不是简单的新信息，而是一个更大的视角。如果你仍然用过去的方式看待事物，你将只会看到你过去所看到的世界。没有任何新的东西会被揭示。因此，想要获得新的理解，新的启示，需要一个不同的视角。否则，心灵只会保护它已经相信的想法，并抵制或对抗任何挑战它的想法。</p>
<p>A new spiritual perspective and an understanding of spirituality in the universe is being provided through The Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality. Instead of receiving this gift from the Creator, some people may say, “Well, this is all coming from one person. He is going to become so rich and powerful!” Ha! We hope he doesn’t get destroyed, actually. Is it a blessing to have all of this given through you into the world? Is it really a blessing to be maligned and condemned or even deified by people? We think it is a great burden and a great sacrifice to accept such a responsibility. The best thing you can hope for is anonymity, but you won’t have it because sooner or later people will find out. “Well, this person really says that he has something that no one else has,” and then everyone goes crazy about it. “How can someone say this! Who does he think he is! He must be cavorting with the devil! And if he is cavorting with the Angels, well, why does he get to be the one and not me?” You see, it is hard to be a messenger.</p>
<p>通过大社区精神性的教导，正在提供一种新的精神视角和对宇宙中精神性的理解。而不是从造物主这里接收这份礼物，有些人可能会说：“好吧，这一切都是出自一个人。他将变得如此富有和强大！”哈！我们其实希望他不会被摧毁。通过你将这一切带入世界，真的是一种祝福吗？被人诽谤、谴责，甚至被神化，真的算是一种祝福吗？我们认为接受这样的责任是一种极大的负担和牺牲。你所能希望的最好结果就是匿名，但你不会有这样的机会，因为迟早人们会发现。“这个人竟然声称他有别人没有的讯息”，然后每个人都为此疯狂。“怎么会有人这样说！他以为自己是谁！他一定是在与魔鬼勾结！如果他是在与天使交往，那为什么是他而不是我呢？”你看，做一名信使是艰难的。</p>
<p>Yet someone has to do it. And a person needs great assistance or it cannot be done. They must have great self-trust, great confidence in the Creator and great discernment to tell whether they are being correctly or incorrectly guided. Certainly, anyone who is protecting their money or their social standing could not be in such a position without great personal conflict.</p>
<p>然而，必须有人来做这件事。而一个人需要极大的帮助，否则这件事是无法完成的。他们必须有极大的自我信任，对造物主有极大的信心，并有极大的辨别力来分辨他们是否被正确或错误地指导。当然，任何一个试图保护自己的钱财或社会地位的人，在没有经历巨大的内心冲突的情况下，是不可能处于这样的位置的。</p>
<p>Therefore, new information is needed here, a new perspective, a Greater Community perspective. You have to start thinking like someone who lives in a Greater Community and not simply someone who lives in a neighborhood or a town. Perspective can be learned. And when you gain a new perspective, particularly a greater perspective like this, well, you can see and know things that simply were not obvious before. And these things will not be based upon speculation but upon clear observation.</p>
<p>因此，在这里需要新的信息，一个新的视角，一个大社区的视角。你必须开始像生活在大社区中的人一样思考，而不是简单地生活在一个街区或城镇的人。视角是可以学习的。当你获得一个新的视角，尤其是像这样的广阔视角时，你可以看到并知道以前根本不明显的事情。而这些事情将不是基于猜测，而是基于清晰的观察。</p>
<p>At some point, you will say, “Well, of course no one should be visiting us without our permission!” That becomes obvious. Right now, people never even think to ask that question. “Well, I don’t know….” At some point, you become aware that spiritually advanced races do not go around intervening in other people’s worlds. They may send messages through observers, like the Allies of Humanity, but they do not intervene. The spiritually advanced in the universe do not do that, regardless of their cultures, their worlds, their temperaments or their natures because this is wisdom and wisdom is universal. So just because someone can fly in a spacecraft and get here quickly, relatively speaking, to think that they are spiritually advanced, well, that is ignorance. So when you gain a Greater Community perspective, you realize that the wise do not intervene. The wise do not come here and change everything.</p>
<p>在某个时刻，你会说：“当然，没有我们的允许，任何种族都不能来拜访我们！”这变得显而易见。而现在，人们甚至从未想过要提出这个问题。“好吧，我不知道……”在某些时候，你会察觉到，精神上先进的种族不会到处干预其他种族的世界。他们可能会通过观察者传递信息，比如人类的盟友，但他们不会干预。宇宙中精神上先进的种族，无论他们的文化、世界、气质或天性如何，都不会这样做，因为这是一种智慧，而智慧是普遍的。所以，仅仅因为有某个种族能够驾驶飞船并相对快速地到达这里，并不能意味着他们在精神上是先进的。这是无知的表现。当你获得大社区的视角时，你会意识到智者不会干预。他们不会来到这里并改变一切。</p>
<p>There are circumstances where genetic material will be given to an evolving race, but that is not what is occurring in the world at this time, we can assure you. Humanity has everything it needs to be successful. It does not need advanced technology. It does not need alien genetic material. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is either part of the Intervention or is unwittingly supporting it.</p>
<p>在某些情况下，可能会向一个进化中的种族提供基因材料，但我们可以向你保证，这不是目前世界上正在发生的事情。人类拥有成功所需的一切。它不需要先进的技术，也不需要外星的基因材料。任何试图告诉你相反观点的人，要么是干预的一部分，要么是在不知不觉中支持干预。</p>
<p>Humanity needs a new perspective. But within you, and within the human race, is the seed of Knowledge, your Spiritual Mind. This Knowledge is ancient and has been with you all along. If you can discover it, it will reveal to you what you need to know and what you need to do. Everyone who is born into the world today is born with the potential for understanding the Greater Community because this is the time when humanity gains contact with life in the universe, which we call the Greater Community. This understanding is in you already.</p>
<p>人类需要一个新的视角。但在你的内心深处，在人类种族内部，存在着内识的种子，你们的精神心智。这种内识是古老的，它一直伴随着你们。如果你能够发现它，它将向你揭示你需要知道的事情以及你需要做的事情。今天出生在这个世界上的每个人都有理解大社区的潜力，因为这是人类与宇宙生命接触的时代，我们称之为大社区。这种理解已经存在于你的心中。</p>
<p>If any alien race tells you, “Well, we are here to enhance your genetic code,” you must not believe this. It is not true. If you really want to be a laboratory animal, if you really want to be subjected to an occupation, if you think this is what it means to have contact with life in the universe, then what is going to change your mind? Experiencing the occupation and waking up one day and saying, “My God! I am no longer a free person and I have no recourse”?</p>
<p>如果任何外星种族告诉你，“你好，我们是来增强你们的基因代码的”，你绝对不能相信。这不是真的。如果你真的愿意成为实验室里的动物，真的愿意被占据，如果你认为这就是与宇宙中的生命接触的意义，是什么使你的心灵发生了变化？是不是要亲身经历占据，直到某天醒来时说：“我的上帝！我不再是自由的人了，而且我无力反抗”？</p>
<p>Is it too audacious to say that this is the most important problem in the world and that God has given an answer and the answer has been given in a teaching? Is it too audacious to say that this is the most important problem in the world and God has given an answer, and the answer is being given through one person? How else would the answer be given? Would it be given to a hundred people? The message would never get beyond them if it did.</p>
<p>说这是世界上最重要的问题，上帝已经给出了答案，而且答案是通过一个人的教导给出的，这是不是太大胆了？说这是世界上最重要的问题，上帝已经给出了答案，而且答案是通过一个人给出的，这是不是太大胆了？否则，答案还能如何给出呢？它会传递给一百个人？如果是这样，这个讯息就永远不会超越他们。</p>
<p>When Jesus came, were there a hundred Jesuses, all competing with each other? “Well, my Jesus is the real Jesus, but yours is not!” That is not how revelation is brought to the world because it does not work.</p>
<p>当耶稣来到时，是否会有一百个耶稣相互竞争呢？“嗯，我的耶稣是真正的耶稣，而你的不是！”这不是启示传递给世界的方式，因为这种方式行不通。</p>
<p>We are beyond the world. We are the Angels. So we can say audacious things and then go somewhere else. We don’t have to deal with the repercussions. We just deliver the message and people either go crazy with it or they become illuminated by it. But we’re somewhere else. It does not affect us.</p>
<p>我们是超越世界的。我们是天使。所以我们可以说一些大胆的话，然后去其他地方。我们不需要应对后果。我们只是传递信息，然后人们要么为之疯狂，要么因此得到启发。但我们在其他地方。它并不影响我们。</p>
<p>However, for the messenger, it is another story. He has to face all of the reaction that will occur. It is not an easy job. Be glad that you are not given this job. But understand that as your realization occurs, you will have to advocate for this awareness too. You will not have the difficulty that the messenger has, but you will face all the things that we are talking about. You will see the effects of the Intervention. You will see the effects of the Pacification Program. You will see how listless people are, how critical they are and how much they are in denial. And all of their outrage and all of their suspicion and all of their fear and all of their avoidance, you will see. It will be as clear as day. And you will understand then how revelation occurs in the world. When the message has to be given and time is of the essence, this is how it occurs. This is the difficulty. This is the challenge.</p>
<p>然而，对于信使来说，这又是另一个故事。他必须面对所有即将发生的反应。这不是一份轻松的工作。要庆幸自己没有被赋予这项工作。但要理解，当你意识到这一点时，你也将不得不为这种觉知发声。你不会面临信使所经历的所有困难，但你仍将遇到我们所谈论的一切。你会看到干预的影响。你会看到安抚计划的后果。你会看到人们的无精打采、批评和否认。他们的愤怒、怀疑、恐惧和逃避，所有这些你都会看得一清二楚。到那时你会理解启示是如何在世界上发生的。当讯息必须传达而时间紧迫时，这就是它发生的方式。这就是困难所在，这就是挑战。</p>
<p>The real problem ultimately is not with the Intervention, though that is a real problem. The bigger problem is human response-ability. The ability of people to respond. The lack of response. The ignorant response. The negative response. If people cannot respond, well, the world will be given away.</p>
<p>最终，真正的问题并不完全是干预，尽管它确实是一个大问题。更大的问题是人类的回应能力。缺乏回应、无知的回应、负面的回应。如果人类不能做出回应，世界将会被拱手相让。</p>
<p>There are not many visitors here in the world. Their numbers are not that great. But their job is being made easy because of human acquiescence and human ignorance. Again, the response. The ability to respond. Response-ability. If there is no response-ability, well, people will not respond, and the occupation will happen, right beneath their feet. And people will think, “Oh, well, something is going on in the world. Things certainly are changing!” And it will seem to be okay until they find out what it really is.</p>
<p>在这里，来访者的数量并不多。他们的人数并不多，但由于人类的默许和无知，他们的工作变得轻而易举。再次强调，问题在于回应——人们是否有回应的能力。如果没有回应能力，人们就不会做出回应，世界的占领将会悄然发生在他们脚下。人们会想，“哦，好吧，世界上有些事情正在发生。事情确实在改变！”在他们发现问题的真相之前，这一切似乎都没什么问题。</p>
<p>That is why at this time an urgent message is being delivered. The awareness is the first thing. Then you must learn about life in the Greater Community, which you can begin to do by looking at your own world objectively. Then you must begin to gain a Greater Community perspective and learn about life and spirituality in the universe. This is now being presented in the teaching on Greater Community Spirituality. Not everyone will be able to learn this teaching, but enough people in many places will need access to it in order to comprehend what is going on.</p>
<p>这就是为什么在这个时候，紧急讯息正在被传递。第一件事是觉知。然后，你必须学习有关大社区的生命，而你可以通过客观地看待你自己的世界来开始这个学习。接着，你必须开始获得大社区的视角，并学习宇宙中的生命和精神性。这正是在大社区精神性中被传授的。并不是每个人都能学习这个教导，但在许多地方，需要有足够多的人获得它，以便理解正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>Humanity could end the Intervention tomorrow if it were informed and aware. Humanity could prevent a future Intervention of this kind if it were informed and aware and united. People are so preoccupied with themselves that their borders are undefended. Oh, yes, they have borders, between each other, tremendous borders, walls and resistance and hostility. But your borders to space are undefended. You have no walls to prevent the outside from coming in because you do not think there is an outside that can come in or that will come in.</p>
<p>如果人类能够知情并察觉到问题的严重性，明天就可以结束干预。如果人类知情、察觉并团结一致，也可以防止未来此类干预的发生。人们太过专注于自身，以至于他们的边界无人防守。是的，他们在人与人之间设立了许多边界，筑起了高墙、怀有敌意，但他们的太空边界却无人防守。你们没有墙去阻止外部势力的进入，因为你们认为外部没有任何威胁，或是不相信威胁会到来。</p>
<p>This, then, is a time for courage, trust and honesty. Time for a real reckoning within yourself. Read The Allies Briefings and ask yourself, “What do I really know?” not “What do I want?” or “What do I prefer?” or “What do I believe?” but “What do I really know here? Is this really happening?” Consult Knowledge within yourself if you can, not your ideas or your fears or your beliefs, but something deeper within you. That is where the real confirmation will happen. And it will take great courage to ask this because this awareness will change your life. It will set you free. And it will give you direction. But you must be willing to have this change within yourself. This is the revelation that happens within each person. It is much resisted. Much delayed. But if it can take place, it is the most valuable thing.</p>
<p>因此，现在是一个需要勇气、信任和诚实的时候。是时候对自己进行一次真正的清算了。阅读人类盟友的简报，并问你自己：“我真正知道的是什么？”而不是“我想要什么？”或者“我喜欢什么？”或者“我相信什么？”而是“我真正知道的是什么？这真的在发生吗？”如果可以的话，请咨询你内心更深层次的内识，而不是你的想法、恐惧或信念，因为真正的确认会在你内心深处发生。提问需要极大的勇气，因为这种觉知将改变你的生命。它将解放你，并为你指引方向。但你必须愿意在自己内心深处进行这种改变。这就是每个人内心的启示。它常常被强烈抵抗并进行推迟。但如果它能发生，这是最有价值的事情。</p>
<p>We send our blessings to you and ask that you receive this counsel and consider it for yourself, for you must make the ultimate decision. We can only inform. We cannot control. The Presence of the Teachers is with you.</p>
<p>我们向你送去祝福，并要求你能接受这些建议，并为自己思考它，因为最终的决定必须由你来做。我们只能提供信息，我们无法控制你。老师们的存在与你同在。</p>
