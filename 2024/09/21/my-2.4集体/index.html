This ranges from pre-agricultural societies all the way up to empires, Collectives, and other kinds of organizations established between worlds for mutual defense and trade. At every level of this evolution, there are countless expressions. Yet as we have said, there are vast regions of the galaxy that are unexplored and sparsely populated, where many societies live in secret. And there are many cultures that have never even been discovered.</p>
<p>大社区中的社会存在于每一个可以想象的社会和精神发展阶段。这包括从农业社会一直延伸到帝国、集体以及世界之间为相互防御和贸易而建立的其他类型的社会。在这种进化的每一个阶段，都有无数的表现形式。然而，正如我们所说，银河系中有广阔的未被探索的稀少居住区域，许多社会在这些地方秘密地生活着，而且有许多文化甚至从未被发现。</p>
<p>In our previous discourse, we gave the analogy of the galaxy being linked together with a series of routes, like a roadmap in your world. There are major avenues of travel, there are secondary avenues of travel, and there are areas where no “roads” exist at all.</p>
<p>在我们之前的论述中，我们给出了这样的比喻：银河系被一系列的路线连接在一起，就像你们世界中的路线图。有主要的旅行途径，有次要的旅行途径，还有一些地区根本不存在“道路”。</p>
<p>The impressions that we would like to give you regarding the Greater Community are most relevant to your position in space and are most descriptive of the environments that are in close proximity to your world. Yet your range of vision is still extremely limited, and you cannot see beyond the closest planets even in your Solar System. Your attempts at radio communication are futile because no one uses this kind of technology for interplanetary communication.</p>
<p>我们想给你们的关于大社区的印象与你们在太空中的位置最为相关，也最能说明与你们的世界相近的环境。然而，你们的视野范围仍然极其有限，即使在你们的太阳系中，你们也无法看到最近的行星以外的地方。你们试图通过无线电通信进行联络的努力是徒劳的，因为没有种族使用这种技术进行星际通信。</p>
<p>Travel in the universe is greatly accelerated by your standards but is still very slow, given the enormity of the physical landscape. Large empires and Collectives can only extend themselves where they have established an infrastructure nearby. Managing distant outposts is very difficult logistically and has other hazards regarding the intervention of other races, as well as problems with regional jurisdictions and disputes. For this reason, in sparsely populated areas of the galaxy, the Collectives will not be found. Even large empires may rarely send resource explorers to these regions, for they are far too distant, and even if discoveries could be made, the logistical problems in sending supplies and gaining access to these resources are formidable. To complicate the matter further, in more populated areas in the galaxy, there are regional rules of conduct. So nations are not that free to move anywhere they want to go in their explorations.</p>
<p>按照你们的标准来看，宇宙中的旅行速度已经大大加快，但相对于宇宙的庞大物理环境，旅行的速度依旧很慢。大型帝国和集体只能在它们附近已经建立基础设施的地方扩展自己。管理遥远的前哨站在后勤上是非常困难的，并且存在其他风险，如其他种族的干预，以及区域管辖权和纠纷的问题。由于这个原因，在银河系人口稀少的地区，不会发现集体的存在。即使是大型帝国也很少派遣资源探险者来到这些区域，因为距离太过遥远，即使有所发现，向这些资源发送补给和获取它们的后勤问题也是非常艰巨的。进一步复杂化的是，在银河系中更为人口密集的地区，存在区域行为规则。因此，各国在其探索中并不能自由地随意前往任何地方。</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot expect the human family to understand this. Your current perspective is that the universe is really there to be explored and to be taken for your own advantage. But, alas, you are not the first ones to arrive there. And there are many civilizations and empires that are far older than anything that humanity has established so far on Earth.</p>
<p>当然，我们不能指望人类大家庭能够理解这一点。你们当前的视角是，宇宙存在的目的是为了被探索并为你们所用。但遗憾的是，你们并不是第一个到达宇宙的种族。而且在宇宙中存在着许多比人类在地球上建立的任何文明都要古老的文明和帝国。</p>
<p>Wars and great conflicts do occur in the universe, but they are relatively rare. Rebellions and internal disputes are more common, but wars between large nations and empires in the universe are far more rare than you might think. We cannot speak for other galaxies, for we have never ventured there. But from what we know of this galaxy and of our own travels, we know these things to be quite true.</p>
<p>宇宙中确实发生过战争和重大冲突，但相对来说并不多见。叛乱和内部纠纷比较常见，但宇宙中的大国和帝国之间的战争比你们想象的要少得多。我们不能代表其他星系发言，因为我们从未涉足过那里。但根据我们对这个星系的了解和我们自身的旅行，我们知道这些事情都是很真实的。</p>
<p>Humanity is still discovering many secrets about technology, and so this is where it places its hope and its promise. However, amongst more advanced nations, power of influence in the mental environment is the far greater arena of influence. For as we have said, technology can be purchased and copied. That is not where the real advantages will usually be found.</p>
<p>人类仍在探索关于技术的许多秘密，因此这是它的希望和承诺所在。然而，在更先进的国家中，心理环境中的影响力才是更大的影响领域。因为正如我们所说，技术可以被购买和复制，这并不是真正的优势通常会被发现的地方。</p>
<p>However, resources are valuable, and therefore, the destruction of natural environments is generally looked on with disfavor. To preserve these resources and environments, most resource explorers including Collectives will attempt to persuade the native race to come into alliance with them rather than try to overtake that race by force. This strategy is also understood by many advanced civilizations, who have learned through much trial and error and through many difficult periods in the history of their worlds. As societies become more technologically advanced, the need for resources is greater and the preservation of natural resources becomes a greater emphasis. In many cases, home worlds have outstripped their own planets’ resources, even to the point where these worlds have become barren and unproductive.</p>
<p>然而，资源是宝贵的，因此对自然环境的破坏通常是不受欢迎的。为了保护这些资源和环境，大多数资源勘探者，包括集体，都会试图说服当地种族与他们结盟，而不是试图通过武力占领这个种族。这种策略也被许多先进的文明所理解，他们通过大量的试验和错误，在他们世界的历史上经历了许多艰难的时期，学会了这种策略。随着社会的技术越来越先进，对资源的需求也越来越大，对自然资源的保护变得更加重要。在许多情况下，母星的资源已经超过了它们自己星球的资源，甚至到了这些世界变得贫瘠和没有生产力的地步。</p>
<p>This gives evidence as to why your world is viewed with such great interest amongst those few races, relatively speaking, who are aware of you. Biologically rich, rich in resources, strategically important and accessible to many of the Collectives who live in this part of the galaxy, it is a true prize.</p>
<p>这证明了为什么你们的世界在少数察觉到你们的种族中受到如此浓厚的兴趣。这里生物多样、资源丰富，具有战略重要性，而且居住在银河系这一部分的许多集体都可以到达，它是一个真正的奖赏。</p>
<p>Your proximity to areas that are fairly well inhabited holds both a disadvantage and an advantage for you. The disadvantage, of course, is that your world will be recognized and is within reach of Collectives, which are but one form of social structure in the universe. The advantage for you, however, is that your world cannot be conquered, for you live in a region that is governed by rules of conduct. If your world existed in a very remote part of the galaxy, where such rules of conduct were not established, then your world could be taken by force. It could be taken by resource explorers, by pirates, by large nation states, by anyone who could gain access to it and maintain control and authority.</p>
<p>你们与相对繁密居住区域的接近既有优势也有劣势。当然，劣势是你们的世界会被认知，并且是在集体的范围内，这些集体仅仅是宇宙中的一种社会结构。然而，你们的优势在于，你们的世界不能被征服，因为你们生活在一个由行为规范所统治的区域。如果你们的世界位于银河系中一个非常偏远的区域，在那里没有建立这样的行为规范，那么你们的世界可能会被武力占领，它可能被资源勘探者、海盗、大国或任何能够进入并维持控制权和权威的势力所占领。</p>
<p>So the fact that you live in a more, shall we say, “civilized” part of the universe, does give you some degree of protection. In this region, where we also dwell, it is illegal for a new world such as yours to be invaded without the permission of the indigenous race. This means that your world cannot become a part of a larger association unless humanity demonstrates visibly that it agrees to this and that it welcomes intervention.</p>
<p>因此，生活在一个更为“文明”的宇宙区域，为你们提供了一定程度的保护。在这个我们也居住的区域，像你们这样的新兴世界，如果没有当地种族的许可，被入侵是违法的。这意味着，除非人类明确表示同意并欢迎干预，否则你们的世界无法成为更大协会的一部分。</p>
<p>Because the Greater Community, especially the area in which you live, is a very competitive environment and because there are many Collectives dwelling here, they tend to hold each other in check and will take legal action against one another if necessary should the basic rules of conduct be violated. Therefore, if one Collective sought to take this world by force, it would be countered by other Collectives who have an interest in this world and by their competitors elsewhere, who would hold these kinds of actions in check.</p>
<p>因为在大社区，特别是你们所在的区域，是一个竞争非常激烈的环境，而且因为有许多集体居住在这里，他们倾向于互相牵制，并且如果有必要，会在基本行为规则被违反时对彼此采取法律行动。因此，如果一个集体试图用武力夺取这个世界，就会遭到对这个世界感兴趣的其他集体以及其他地方的竞争对手的反击，他们会对这类行为加以控制。</p>
<p>We cannot expect you to be aware of the details of such a complex situation, but it is important for you to know that the universe around you is not empty and devoid of life. It is important for you to know that the universe near your shores is not primitive and unregulated. This will help you understand how the Collectives that are intervening in your world function and how they can be counteracted. This gives you certain advantages, which you must learn to recognize and to employ on your own behalf.</p>
<p>我们不能指望你们能察觉如此复杂情况的细节，但重要的是，你们要知道，你们周围的宇宙并不是空洞的，没有生命。重要的是，你们要知道，你们海岸附近的宇宙并不是原始的和不受监管的。这将帮助你们理解干预你们世界的集体是如何运作的，以及如何与之抗衡。这给了你们某些优势，你们必须学会认识到这些优势，并为自己所用。</p>
<p>There are other parts of the universe where great empires exist, and they set their own rules, having few competitors within their regions. And there are many other areas where many nations have joined together in associations, either economic, political or military, or all three, for their mutual trade and defense. These are quite common in areas that are well inhabited in the universe.</p>
<p>宇宙中还有一些地方存在着大帝国，它们制定自己的规则，在自己的区域内几乎没有竞争对手。还有许多其他区域，许多国家联合起来，组成经济、政治、军事或三者兼备的联盟，共同进行贸易和防御。这些情况在宇宙中的人口稠密地区是非常普遍的。</p>
<p>The region in which you live, which encompasses, by your reckoning, a very vast area, contains approximately five thousand stars. We call this a region because that is how it is delineated. This is a very small part of the galaxy, as you can imagine, but quite large in terms of your interests and needs. In this region, there are important rules of conduct. You have small empires, some of which you would call dictatorships and some of which are more democratic in nature. You have Collectives, which are quite powerful but limited in certain areas of their influence. Yet within this region, all areas that are connected by main thoroughfares of trade are ruled by codes and councils. This is to provide safety and security and to assure that violence does not erupt and grow into all-out warfare. Disputes occur frequently and are handled either through negotiations or through legal procedures.</p>
<p>你们所居住的区域，根据你们的计算，包含了一个非常广阔的区域，大约有五千颗恒星。我们称这为一个区域，因为它就是这样划分的。正如你们所想象的，这是银河系的一个非常小的部分，但就你们的利益和需求而言却是相当大的。在这个区域中，有重要的行为规则。这里有小型的帝国，其中一些你们可以称为专制政权，而另一些则更接近于民主的形式。在你们这个区域有相当强大的集体，但它们的影响力在某些领域受到限制。然而，在这个区域内，所有通过主要贸易通道连接的地区都受制于法规和委员会的统治。这样做的目的是为了提供安全保障，确保暴力不会爆发并演变成全面战争。争端经常发生，但通常通过谈判或法律程序来解决。</p>
<p>However, these governing bodies only oversee trade routes, primarily. And they are supported by organizations of states that belong to them for their own mutual benefit and security. Some of these organizations are stronger than others. Yet where you have larger competing powers, the rules of conduct are taken quite seriously and are enforced quite seriously.</p>
<p>然而，这些治理机构主要只负责监督贸易路线。它们由隶属于这些贸易网络的国家组成的组织支持，以实现它们的共同利益和安全。其中一些组织比其他组织更强大。然而，在有更大竞争力量存在的地方，行为规则被极其严肃地对待和执行。</p>
<p>In the region in which your world exists, Collectives are not allowed to have armies or military forces. They are allowed to have security forces, however, for their own defense. Being primarily economic institutions, they do seek to protect their interests and their avenues of trade with their own forces. But they do not have large armies such as you might imagine. They may hire security forces when travelling in areas that are considered unsafe for trade or which are politically unstable between resident nations. But essentially, Collectives, which we would like to take some time to describe now, are not military powers. They are economic powers. Their focus is on trade, resource acquisition and building their alliance amongst worlds such as your own.</p>
<p>在你们世界所处的区域，集体是不允许拥有军队或军事力量的。然而，它们被允许拥有自己的安保部队，以便自我防卫。作为主要的经济机构，他们确实寻求用自身的力量来保护他们的利益和他们的贸易通道。但它们并不像你们想象的那样拥有庞大的军队。在需要前往贸易安全性较低或政治不稳定的区域时，它们可能会雇佣安保力量。但从根本上讲，集体，我们现在想花一些时间来描述它们，不是军事强国，它们是经济力量。它们的重点是贸易、资源获取以及在像你们这样的世界中建立联盟。</p>
<p>There are many Collectives functioning in the region in which your world exists. Some of these Collectives are centered within this region. Some have centers elsewhere and have major satellite establishments here. It is an interesting fact of life that wherever Collectives exist and compete with each other, other nations have established their own defenses against them so that the Collectives cannot intervene in these worlds’ trade, commerce and internal affairs. Because we are talking about many nations within a region, many of which have their own military establishments, the Collectives then must abide by certain rules of conduct or face very grave consequences. Being without significant weaponry of their own, they must utilize negotiations, diplomacy and influence as their primary means of accomplishment.</p>
<p>在你们世界所在的区域内，有许多集体在运作。其中一些集体是以这个地区为中心的。有些则在其他地区拥有中心并在此设有重要的卫星机构。一个有趣的生命事实是，凡是存在集体并相互竞争的地方，其他国家都建立了自己的防御系统，以便集体不能干预这些世界的贸易、商业和内部事务。因为我们谈论的是一个区域的许多国家，其中许多国家有自己的军事机构，所以集体必须遵守某些行为规则，否则将面临非常严重的后果。因为它们没有显著的武器力量，它们必须依赖谈判、外交和影响力作为其主要的手段。</p>
<p>Therefore, those whom you are encountering in the universe at this time represent highly organized, very hierarchical organizations whose function is resource acquisition and development. Collectives, by and large, are made up of a series of races functioning at different levels of authority and command. Those who really control the Collectives that are functioning in your world have probably not been encountered by anyone in the world yet. You have only recognized the worker classes who are bred to serve in specific functions. Though they are biological entities, their biological codes, their training, their upbringing and their genetic focus have given them very little individuality and individual abilities of reasoning and discernment. They function very much like, well, a collective mind. They are rigidly controlled. They have little or no personal freedom. Their areas of function are very specific and are carried out with impressive efficiency.</p>
<p>因此，此时你们在宇宙中遇到的集体代表着高度组织化、等级森严的组织，他们的职能是获取和开发资源。总的来说，集体是由一系列的种族组成的，在不同的权力和指挥层级上运作。在你们的世界里，那些真正控制着集体的种族可能还没有被这个世界上的任何人遇到过。你们只认识到了那些被培养来履行特定职能的工人阶级。虽然他们是生物实体，但他们的生物代码、他们的训练、他们的成长经历和他们的遗传焦点，使他们几乎没有个性，也没有个体的推理能力和辨别能力。它们的功能很像，嗯，一个集体的心智。他们被严格控制。他们几乎没有个人自由。他们的职能范围非常明确，并以令人印象深刻的效率执行。</p>
<p>Yet Collectives are inherently weak because they are not built on what we call “Knowledge.” Therefore, they do not have the strength of insight. They are not creative in their approaches. They tend to mimic one another. They rely upon their structure, their codes of conduct and their ability to manipulate the thoughts and feelings of not only their members but of those races whom they seek to influence. While the Collectives are very powerful in certain respects, they do have inherent weaknesses.</p>
<p>然而，集体本质上是脆弱的，因为它们不是建立在我们所说的内识之上。因此，它们没有洞察力的深度。它们的方法没有创造性。它们倾向于相互模仿。它们依靠自己的结构、行为准则以及它们的能力，不仅操纵自己成员的思想和情感，而且操纵它们试图影响的那些种族的思想和情感。虽然集体在某些方面非常强大，但它们也有固有的弱点。</p>
<p>Throughout history, Collectives have had great difficulty in maintaining control and authority over their resident populations because they comprise many different racial groups. The worker classes are bred to serve, but even they have certain qualities that the ruling classes of the Collectives find difficult to manage. Revolts have occurred, and Collectives have suffered great losses as a result. They are most certainly imperfect, but more fundamentally, they are not governed by Knowledge, or the power of Spirit. This means that their defenses can be penetrated, their secrets can be uncovered, their activities can be revealed and their deceptions can be comprehended by those who are strong with Knowledge and who are free to see, to know and to act.</p>
<p>纵观历史，因为集体由许多不同的种族群体所组成，在维持对它居住人口的控制和权威方面遇到了极大困难。工人阶级是为服务而生的，但即便如此，统治阶层仍然发现他们的一些特质难以管理。曾经发生过叛乱，集体因此蒙受了巨大的损失。毫无疑问，它们是有缺陷的，但更根本的问题在于它们并不受内识或精神力量的引导。这意味着，它们的防御可以被穿透，它们的秘密可以被揭露，它们的活动可以被曝光，而它们的欺骗手段也可以被那些内识的强者所理解，他们可以自由地看见、知道和行动。</p>
<p>Other nations in regions such as yours deal with the Collectives very, very carefully and do not allow them any kind of penetration into their world’s internal affairs. Sometimes the Collectives are viewed as a necessary evil to provide essential resources that are needed by these worlds. The Collectives have great craft and great skill in the areas in which they are strong. And nations which have been able to interact with them successfully have had to maintain a significant distance and be extremely discreet.</p>
<p>像你们这样地区的其他国家对集体的处理非常小心，不允许集体对它们世界的内部事务进行任何形式的渗透。有时，集体被视为必要之恶，为这些世界提供所需的基本资源。集体在其擅长的领域拥有精湛的技艺和高超的技能。那些能够与集体成功互动的国家，必须保持显著的距离并极为谨慎。</p>
<p>Certainly, interventions such as the one happening in your world would not be allowed by any race that understood its true interests and the realities of life in the universe. The fact that the Intervention is well underway in your world demonstrates that humanity does not have this awareness and does not have the unity or the social cohesion to resist and to offset unwarranted and unwanted interventions such as this.</p>
<p>当然，任何理解自身真正利益和宇宙生命现实的种族都不会允许像你们世界这样的干预行为。事实上，干预在你们世界的顺利进行表明，人类并没有这种觉知，也没有足够的团结或社会凝聚力来抵御并抵消这种不当和不受欢迎的干预。</p>
<p>We have been told that there are great economic organizations that have interests all around your globe and that employ different nations and different groups in service to these organizations. Perhaps this can serve, then, as an example. But Collectives are far larger. They may encompass hundreds of worlds and planetary establishments and exist across vast reaches of space. They can have significant control and are always interested in gaining new allegiances and new members.</p>
<p>我们被告知，在你们的地球上存在一些大型经济组织，它们在全球范围内都有利益，并雇佣不同国家和不同群体为这些组织服务。或许这可以作为一个例子。但集体要大得多。它们可能涵盖数百个世界和行星基地，横跨辽阔的空间范围。它们可能拥有显著的控制力，并且总是对获得新的效忠和新的成员感兴趣。</p>
<p>Collectives are but one form of social structure in the universe. Collectives vary amongst themselves. Some are purely economic and secular in their establishment, focus, theory and philosophy. Others have religious components. However, having religious components does not mean that they are religious in nature. It simply means that part of their philosophy encompasses spirituality, to whatever degree spiritual awareness exists in their members and directs the spiritual awareness or interest, particularly amongst its ruling classes. Yet we have found with very few exceptions that Collectives consider their own survival and their own structure to be the sole focus of their devotion. Their devotion is almost religious in nature, even though their organizations rarely are. If they were strong with Knowledge, they would not be Collectives.</p>
<p>集体只是宇宙中社会结构的一种形式。集体之间的情况各不相同。有些集体的建立、关注点、理论和哲学是纯粹的经济性和世俗性的。其他集体则有宗教成分。然而，拥有宗教成分并不意味着它们具有宗教性质。这只是意味着它们的部分哲学涵盖了一定程度的精神性，而这种精神觉知或兴趣，特别是在其统治阶层中占据主导地位。然而，我们发现，除了极少数的例外情况，集体认为自己的生存和自己的结构是他们奉献的唯一重点。虽然它们的奉献精神几乎具有宗教性质，但它们的组织很少是宗教性的。如果它们拥有强大的内识，它们就不会成为集体。</p>
<p>Fundamentally, a Collective is different from an empire in that it has no source home planet. It is a group of planets that are dissimilar which have joined together, usually through conquest and persuasion, and have become a formidable economic force. Whereas an empire is usually centered in one world or in one region by one race, Collectives are made up of many different races. We have never been able to penetrate the hierarchy of a Collective, and so we cannot speak to the composition of its leadership in terms of their racial background. But we know that they are diverse and that they manage their diversity with a strict code of ethics and a hierarchical control that you would find totally oppressive. Certainly, we could not live within such a society although in our cases, we came very close to having to do so.</p>
<p>从根本上讲，一个集体与一个帝国的区别在于，集体没有属于自己的家园星球。它是一群不同的星球，它们通常通过征服和说服而联合起来，成为一支强大的经济力量。而帝国通常集中在一个世界或一个地区，并由一个种族所主导，而集体则由多个不同的种族组成。我们从未能够渗透到一个集体的等级制度中，因此无法讨论其领导层在种族背景上的组成。但我们知道它们是多样化的，并通过一种严格的伦理规范和一种你们会认为极具压迫性的等级控制来管理这种多样性。当然，我们不可能生活在这样的社会中，尽管在我们的案例中，我们非常接近于不得不这样做。</p>
<p>True democracy, as you would call it, exists in the universe, even in great manifestations, but it is far more rare than you might think. And certainly any true democracy would have to become very strong in its dealings with the Greater Community, very careful to avoid, if possible, interactions with Collectives and other aggressive kinds of empires.</p>
<p>真正的民主，正如你们所称呼的，在宇宙中确实存在，甚至有伟大的表现，但它远比你们想象的要稀少。当然，任何真正的民主都必须在与大社区打交道时变得非常强大，如果可能的话，要非常小心地避免与集体和其他侵略性的帝国的互动。</p>
<p>There is no one empire or Collective in the universe that is predominant. There is too much diversity and life. There is too much competition. And there have been long-standing disputes between certain nations. Advanced technology is abundant amongst many societies, so the advantages sought are not technological in nature. Though some nations are richer than others, defenses have become formidable in the universe against violent intrusion. Here again, the Collectives have certain kinds of advantages in that they do not use force. They do not rely upon a military presence to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>在宇宙中，没有一个帝国或集体是占主导地位的。生命的多样性和竞争过于激烈。一些国家之间甚至存在长期的争端。先进的技术在许多社会中都非常普遍，因此竞争的优势并非基于技术本身。尽管有些国家比其他国家更富有，但在宇宙中，对暴力入侵的防御已经变得非常强大。在这方面，集体具有一定的优势，因为它们不使用武力，也不依赖军事存在来实现它的目标。</p>
<p>Our native worlds all exist either within the region of your world or nearby. We have all had to deal with Collectives. We have all had to deal with resource explorers from other nations. We have all had to learn to protect and secure our freedom and to become as self-sufficient as possible, in many cases relying upon one another for essential resources for our survival and well-being.</p>
<p>我们所有的原生世界都位于你们世界的区域内或附近。我们都曾与集体和来自其他国家的资源勘探者打过交道。我们都必须学会保护自由来确保自己的自由，并尽可能做到自给自足，在许多情况下，我们的生存和福祉需要依靠彼此的基本资源。</p>
<p>The more self-sufficient a world can become and the more that it can sustain this self-sufficiency, the stronger and the more independent it will be by nature in the universe. Often nations become dependent upon Collectives because they have exhausted their fundamental resources and must now rely upon trade and commerce for the very basic things they need to live. This, of course, makes them extremely vulnerable to usurpation, and in many cases they become parts of Collectives themselves or extremely dependent upon them.</p>
<p>一个世界越是能够自给自足，并且越是能够维持这种自给自足，它在宇宙中就会自然而然地变得更加强大和独立。许多国家变得依赖集体，往往是因为它们已经耗尽了自己的基本资源，现在必须依靠贸易和商业来获得最基本的生活必需品。当然，这使他们极易被篡夺，很多情况下它们自己也会成为集体的一部分，或者对集体产生极大的依赖。</p>
<p>With the deterioration of your natural environment and the rapid depletion of your essential resources, you are moving into a position of extreme vulnerability and powerlessness in the universe. This must become part of your understanding. There is little or no awareness of the realities of life, commerce and manipulation in the universe amongst your people, even amongst your governments and leaders. We have learned a great deal from your transmissions, and we have learned much from the Unseen Ones. Your world, in many respects, has problems common to emerging and developing life throughout the universe.</p>
<p>随着你们自然环境的恶化和基本资源的迅速枯竭，你们正在进入宇宙中一个极其脆弱和无力的位置。这必须成为你们理解的一部分。在你们的人民中，甚至在你们的政府和领导人中，对宇宙中的生命、商业和操纵的现实几乎没有觉知。我们从你们的传输中学到了很多，也从不可见者那里学到了很多。在许多方面，你们世界的问题与宇宙中的新兴种族和发展中的生命所面临的问题是相似的。</p>
<p>You have an inherent interest, then, in maintaining and sustaining your world’s fundamental resources and in regenerating these resources successfully. Without this, the Collectives will have a great advantage in their inducements. Without this, even if you resisted the Collectives, eventually you would need what they have to offer—raw materials, energy, food production, advanced technology. All these things create a state of dependency, either to a Collective or to many other kinds of states, nations and organizations that are directly involved in trade and commerce. Clearly your world would be at a great disadvantage if you could not bargain successfully for the very things that you need. Eventually, you would have to accept whatever terms are presented to you. The outcome of this then becomes obvious. You are incorporated into other worlds’ infrastructure, whether it be a Collective, an empire or an aggressive association of worlds, all of whom are always looking for new territory and new resources.</p>
<p>因此，维护和维持你们世界的基本资源并使这些资源成功再生是你们的固有利益。如果不这样做，集体就会在利诱方面占据巨大优势。没有这一点，即使你们抵御了集体，最终你们还是会需要他们提供的东西——原材料、能源、食品生产、先进技术。所有这些东西都会造成一种依赖状态，无论是对集体还是对直接参与贸易和商业的许多其他类型的国家、民族和组织。很明显，如果你们不能成功地为自己需要的资源讨价还价，你们的世界就会处于非常不利的位置。最终，你们将不得不接受向你们提出的任何条件。这样做的结果显而易见。你们被纳入其他世界的基础设施之中，无论是集体、帝国还是侵略性的世界联盟，他们都在不断寻找新的领土和新的资源。</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones have told us in response to our first set of discourses that many people feel helpless and hopeless in the face of encountering all of these things. We understand this. We have faced such thresholds ourselves, with very grave consequences because we did not prepare in time. However, as we have said, and must continue to emphasize, humanity does have the power and the skill to stop the Intervention and to prevent future interventions of this kind. You have inherent Knowledge that lives within you. This is what we mean by spirituality. You have enough individual power and enough technology to offset the kind of intervention that is occurring in your world at this time. You could drive the Intervention out if you had the will to do it. But you must become educated about the Greater Community, and you must be very clear and sober about what you are dealing with at this time. That is why our counsel is so important, if you can receive it.</p>
<p>在回应我们的第一组论述时，不可见者告诉我们，许多人在面对这一切时感到无助和绝望。我们对此表示理解。我们也曾面对过这样的门槛，并且由于未能及时做好准备，付出了非常严重的代价。然而，正如我们所说的，并必须继续强调的是，人类确实有能力和技能来阻止干预，并防止未来发生类似的干预。你们拥有固有的内识，它生活在你们的内心深处，这是我们所指的精神性。你们拥有足够的个人能力和足够的技术来抵消此时此刻发生在你们世界上的干预。如果你们有意愿去做，你们就可以将干预驱逐出去。但是，你们必须接受关于大社区的教育，必须非常清晰和冷静地认识到你们目前正在面对的生命。这就是为什么我们的建议如此重要，前提是你们可以接收它。</p>
<p>Part of the inducement of the Intervention is to discourage those who are aware of its real nature. In other words, for those individuals who become aware of the Intervention, the focus of the visitors then will be to demoralize and to discourage them, to make them feel weak, helpless and impotent in its face, to make them think that they are being visited by enormous powers with unlimited strength, and that they have absolutely no possibility of resisting the visitors’ persuasion or offsetting the visitors’ presence in the world.</p>
<p>干预的部分诱因是让那些察觉到干预真实性质的人望而却步。换句话说，对于那些察觉到干预的人来说，来访者的重点将是打击他们的士气，使他们在干预面前感到软弱、无助和无能，使他们认为自己正面对的是拥有无限力量的强大力量，而且他们绝对没有可能抵制来访者的说服或抵消来访者在世界的存在。</p>
<p>This is but part of the manipulation that is being perpetrated. For those who seem cooperative and receptive, the glorious benefits of collaborating with the visitors will be emphasized. For those who are doubtful about these things or who cannot be persuaded, then discouragement and demoralization will be the primary influence.</p>
<p>这不过是当前操控的一部分。对于那些看似愿意合作的人，将强调与来访者合作的光荣益处；而对于那些心存疑虑或难以说服的人，则会采取打击士气的方式，让他们感到沮丧。</p>
<p>Here, then, it is necessary for you to understand that your own sense of weakness and helplessness is not merely a product of your lack of self-trust but is actually part of the manipulation that is being cast in your mental environment. We understand that the governments of your world encourage their populations to feel weak and dependent upon their government’s structure and authority. But we are talking about a greater and more pervasive kind of influence here.</p>
<p>因此，在这里，你们有必要理解，你们自己的软弱感和无助感不仅仅是缺乏自我信任的产物，实际上也是在你们的心理环境中被操纵的一部分。我们理解，你们世界上的政府鼓励他们的人民感到软弱，并依赖于政府的结构和权威。但我们在这里谈论的是一种更大、更普遍的影响。</p>
<p>Humanity will succumb either because it is persuaded to do so or because it is discouraged from resisting. These are two forms of manipulation with a common goal. Therefore, you must not lose faith. You must learn about life in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>人类会屈服，要么是因为它被说服这样做，要么是因为它不愿意抵抗。这是两种形式的操纵，有着共同的目标。因此，你们绝不能失去信心。你们必须学习关于大社区的生命。</p>
<p>You have strengths and you have weaknesses. The Collectives have strengths and they have weaknesses. Your position in the universe has advantages and disadvantages. You also have allies who want to see human freedom protected and who want to see humanity emerge into the Greater Community as a free, united and protected world. We support this everywhere, for this is the true spiritual inclination. In the universe in which you live, there are formidable forces of opposition against this. However there are powerful forces that keep freedom alive and encourage it and nurture it wherever that can be accomplished.</p>
<p>你们有自己的优点和缺点，集体也有它们的优点和缺点。你们在宇宙中的位置既有优势，也有劣势。同时，你们也有盟友，他们希望保护人类的自由，愿意看到人类作为一个自由、团结和受保护的世界出现在大社区之中。我们到处支持这一点，因为这是最真实的精神性倾向。在你们所处的宇宙中，存在着强大的反对力量。然而，也有强大的力量保持着自由的活力，鼓励自由，并在任何可以实现的地方培育自由。</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that if you feel weak and helpless and overwhelmed, part of this feeling comes from the Intervention itself. Here you must gain great confidence in the inherent goodness of humanity and recognize the real value of your freedom. You have never been challenged like this before. Your freedom has never been challenged as a race, as a people, as a world like this before. Yet everyone in the world can at least value the possibility of freedom and whatever freedom they may have at this moment. It is all at risk now.</p>
<p>因此，要理解，如果你感到软弱、无助和不堪重负，这种感觉有一部分来自干预本身。在这里，你必须对人类固有的善良充满坚定的信心，并认识到你们自由的真正价值。你们以前从未受到过这样的挑战。作为一个种族、作为一个民族、作为一个世界，你们的自由从未像现在这样受到威胁。然而，世界上的每个人至少都可以珍视自由的可能性，以及他们此刻拥有的任何自由。所有这一切现在都处于危险之中。</p>
<p>This is where you find your common unity, and this is where you heal your conflicts and your ancient animosities between one another. Here you settle your scores because now they do not matter. What matters is the preservation of human freedom and your pre-eminence in your own world. What matters now is the preservation of your world’s resources for your own future survival and security. What matters now is that you recognize the Intervention and take the necessary steps to thwart it and to stop it. This must happen at every level of your societies—at the level of government, at the level of religion, and at the level of the will of the common people.</p>
<p>在这里，你们可以找到共同的团结，在这里，你们可以治愈彼此之间的冲突和长期的仇恨。在这里，你们可以放下恩怨，因为现在它们已不再重要。重要的是保护人类的自由，确保你们在自己的世界中占据主导地位。现在重要的是，保护你们世界的资源，为未来的生存和安全打下基础。现在重要的是，你们认识到干预的存在，并采取必要的措施来挫败它。这必须在你们社会的各个层面上发生——政府层面、宗教层面，以及世人的意志层面。</p>
<p>There are great spiritual forces in the world we know who support this and who encourage it. Yet their influence and their voices can be overshadowed by the effects of the Intervention and by the ignorance of people themselves. In our worlds, emissaries were sent to advise us of the impending danger that we faced from the infiltration of foreign powers into our worlds. We were being seduced as you are now being seduced to join in mutual benefits of trade and commerce. Those of us who were skeptical and those of us who resisted such a persuasion were alienated from our societies and were dissuaded and discouraged and demoralized to a point where we could not have the governing voice, where we could not represent the will of the people.</p>
<p>我们知道世界上有伟大的精神力量在支持和鼓励这一切。然而，它们的影响和声音可能会被干预的影响和人们自身的无知所掩盖。在我们的世界中，曾经有使者被派遣来警告我们，外星势力即将渗透我们的世界。我们被引诱加入贸易和商业的互惠利益，而现在你们也正遭遇同样的诱惑。那些持怀疑态度并抵制这种说服的人被社会孤立，受到劝阻和打击，最终沮丧至无法代表人民的意愿，失去了发言权。</p>
<p>If your people simply want little trinkets from the universe, new technological toys to play with, and you would give away your freedom and your autonomy for this, then certainly our words will not be enough. But the education must start somewhere. And it must reach those people who already have a sensitivity to the Greater Community. It must reach those people who value human freedom and do not take it for granted. It must reach those people who have already been affected by the Intervention, either directly or indirectly. It must begin somewhere. You need to know you have allies in the Greater Community, but you also need to know that it will be human strength and human cooperation that will turn the tide in your favor. We cannot intervene beyond giving you our counsel.</p>
<p>如果你们的人民只是想要来自宇宙的小饰品、新的技术玩具，并愿意为此放弃自己的自由和自主权，那么我们的话语显然将不够。教育必须从某个地方开始。它必须传递给那些对大社区已有敏感意识的人，传递给那些珍视人类自由并不认为自由理所当然的人，传递给那些已经受到干预影响，无论是直接还是间接的人。教育必须从某个地方开始。你们需要知道，在大社区中，你们是有盟友的，但你们也需要知道，扭转局势将依靠人类的力量与合作。我们除了向你们提供建议之外，无法进行干预。</p>
<p>You must understand without ambivalence and confusion the real nature and purpose of the Intervention in the world today. At this moment, your true allies are not present in the world. They are not walking the face of your world. They are not dwelling in your world. They are not influencing your governments and people in positions of power. They are not contacting your sensitives and your psychics. They are not trying to persuade those who are religious in their views.</p>
<p>你必须毫不含糊地理解当今世界干预的真正性质和目的。此时此刻，你们的真实盟友并不在这个世界上。他们没有行走在你们的世界之中。他们也没有居住在你们的世界里。他们没有影响你们的政府和有权力的人。他们没有联系你们的敏感者和通灵者。他们并不试图说服那些有宗教信仰的人。</p>
<p>We speak for your true allies. Our counsel is to give you perspective, understanding and sobriety and to help you offset the influences that are being cast upon you and have been cast upon you now for decades. You have the power to resist. You have the power to unite. You have the power to cast off this influence.</p>
<p>我们代表你们真实的盟友发声。我们的建议是给你们提供视角、理解和清醒的认知，并帮助你们抵消目前以及过去几十年来施加在你们身上的影响。你们有抵抗的力量。你们有团结的力量。你们有摆脱这种影响的力量。</p>
<p>The Collectives do not believe you will resist, and so they are less careful than perhaps they should be in influencing you. They think this project will be time-consuming but easy and that the ultimate goal will be achieved without great difficulty. We must then speak to those people who are ready and able to respond. There is no other problem or dilemma in your life as critical as this. Anything that you establish on your own behalf for your nation, for your group, for your culture or your religious tradition will be lost in the face of the Intervention. You do not want to be part of a Collective. You must trust us in this regard and consider our words seriously. There is no freedom there. You will become nothing but servants bonded to your new masters. And though those of you who represent your masters will have certain privileges, you will all be enslaved. And the power then to resist, though it can still be mustered, will have much greater costs and consequences.</p>
<p>集体不相信你们会抵抗，因此他们在影响你们时并没有像本应如此那般谨慎。他们认为这个项目虽然费时，但却轻而易举，最终目标的实现不会有很大的困难。因此，我们必须与那些准备好并能做出回应的人交谈。你们生活中的任何问题或困境，都没有这个问题更为紧迫。无论你们为自己的国家、群体、文化或宗教传统建立了什么基础，它在干预面前都将不复存在。你们不想成为集体的一部分。在这方面，你们必须信任我们，认真考虑我们的话。集体中没有自由。你们将变得一无所有，你们将变成被束缚的仆人，听命于你们的新主子。尽管代表你们主子的人将拥有某些特权，但你们所有人都将成为奴隶。到那时，抵抗的力量虽然仍可集结，但代价和后果将更加沉重。</p>
<p>To those governing powers observing the Collectives who are intervening in your world, it must appear that humanity welcomes the presence of the Collectives. It must appear from the outside that humanity is in favor of this Intervention. That is why there is such a great effort to secure emissaries for the Intervention and to have individuals in positions of power and leadership advocate for the presence of the visitors and affirm the visitors’ promises of greater wealth, power, freedom and peace. Can you understand what we are telling you here? This is a deception, both within your world and beyond.</p>
<p>对于那些正在观察干预你们世界集体的统治者来说，人类似乎欢迎集体的存在。从外界看来，人类似乎支持这种干预。这就是为什么干预力量如此努力地争取代言人，并试图让那些在权力和领导位置上的个人为干预代言，赞同干预所承诺的财富、权力、自由与和平。你能理解我们在这里告诉你的事情吗？这是一种欺骗，不仅存在于你们的世界之内，也存在于世界之外。</p>
<p>Until there is a strong voice resisting the Intervention that is made known and public, it will appear to outside observers that the Intervention is being welcomed by humanity and is being advocated by humanity. Already, the Intervention has many speakers and representatives, but few vocal critics. Even your vocal criticism creates problems for the Intervention. Even for people to speak out and say, “No, this is wrong! We are being visited against our will! We are being persuaded and manipulated against our will! This must not happen! We do not welcome this! And we demand that the visitors leave!” Until these voices are heard, it will appear to governing bodies and to those who compete with these Collectives, that they are here with human consent. Even to arouse a public outcry would have great benefit here for you.</p>
<p>除非有一个强烈抵制干预的声音被知道并公之于众，否则在外部观察者看来，干预似乎受到了人类的欢迎，得到了人类的倡导。目前，干预已经有了许多发言人和代表，但很少有公开的批评者。即使你们的公开批评也会给干预带来问题。即使有人站出来说：”不，这是错误的！我们是在违背自身意愿的情况下被访问的！我们正被说服和操控，这完全违背了我们的意志！这种情况绝不能发生！我们不欢迎这种行为！我们要求来访者离开地球！”在这些声音被听到之前，在管理机构和与这些集体竞争的组织看来，他们是在人类同意的情况下来到这里的。即使是引起公众的强烈抗议，对你们来说也是大有裨益的。</p>
<p>It is not that you have to physically remove the visitors. Instead, you have to demonstrate your displeasure with their presence and with their activities. You have to demonstrate sobriety regarding their inducements and their deceptions. And you have to speak out against their attempt to interbreed with humanity, to create a new leadership here. You have to speak out against the abduction of people against their will. For these things are being carried out in secret. Even outside authorities do not know this is happening.</p>
<p>这并不是说你们必须从物理上赶走这些来访者。相反，你们必须表明自己对他们的存在和活动感到不满。你们必须对他们的引诱和欺骗表现出清醒的态度。你们必须大声反对他们与人类杂交的企图，在这里创造一个新的领导阶层。你们必须大声反对违背人们意愿的绑架行为。因为这些事情正在秘密进行。甚至外界的权威机构也不知道这些事情正在发生。</p>
<p>We must keep emphasizing these things so that you can see and understand clearly. Raise your voice against the Intervention, and the Intervention is put at risk. Resist the Intervention and the Intervention must stop and the Collectives must find other ways to gain your attention and your allegiance.</p>
<p>我们必须不断强调这些事情，以便你们能够清晰地看清并理解。大声疾呼，反对干涉，干预就会陷入危险。抵抗干预，干预就必须停止，集体将不得不寻找其他方法来引起你们的注意并赢得你们的效忠。</p>
<p>As we said in our previous discourses, no one should be setting foot on your soil without your expressed consent. Your allies would not come here without this expressed consent even though at an earlier time your allies did attempt to reach certain individuals in the world, in the face of the Intervention. Yet generally speaking, no true ally of humanity would intervene in human affairs.</p>
<p>正如我们在之前的讨论中所说，没有任何种族应该在未经你们明确同意的情况下踏足你们的土地。你们的盟友不会在没有明确同意的情况下来到这里，尽管在早期阶段，你们的盟友曾试图在干预的情况下联系世界上的某些个人。然而，总的来说，任何真正的人类盟友都不会干涉人类的事务。</p>
<p>Do not think you can persuade those workers in the Collectives whom you will most likely meet in your face-to-face encounters. They have not the discernment or the will to understand your perspective. They are only carrying out their duties as they have been bred to do. Though they are biological beings and still have the potential for Spirit, the likelihood of you being able to persuade them is very, very limited. They are functioning mindlessly. They do not have the moral foundation you have. Personal freedom is unknown to them, and they do not value it, having been taught that personal freedom is chaotic, unruly and destructive. They would not accept your pleas and your admonitions. And even those who manage and control them, though having greater authority, will not be able to comprehend your complaints or your persuasions.</p>
<p>不要认为你们能说服那些你们最有可能在面对面接触中遇到的工人集体。他们没有辨别力，也没有意愿去理解你们的观点。他们只是在履行他们的职责。虽然他们是生物体，并且仍然具有精神的潜能，但你们能说服他们的可能性是极其有限的。他们在无意识地运作。他们没有你们所拥有的道德基础。对他们来说，个人自由是陌生的，他们不重视自由，因为他们被教导个人自由是混乱的、不守规矩的、具有破坏性的。他们不会接受你们的恳求和告诫。即使是那些管理和控制他们的统治者，虽然拥有更大的权威，也无法理解你们的抱怨和劝告。</p>
<p>This is not how the Intervention will be stopped. It will not be stopped by your creating dissension amongst its ranks. The Intervention will be stopped because you have created a voice against it and your people are united in preventing it from happening in the world. At this moment, alien craft come and go at will. People are taken at will. Biological resources are taken at will. Access to individuals in positions of power are made at will. There is not the collective agreement and resistance necessary to offset any of these intrusions, any of these violations of your fundamental rights. This must change. And it must start with someone. It must start with you and with others like you who have a greater awareness and sensitivity. It must start with those who can respond to a message such as ours and who have the inner trust to know that we are speaking the truth.</p>
<p>这不是阻止干预的方式。干预不会因为你们在其内部制造分歧而停止。干预会被阻止，是因为你们创造了一个反对它的声音，你们的人民团结一致，防止干预在世界的再次发生。此时此刻，外星飞船随意进出，人们被随意带走，生物资源被随意夺取，掌握权力的个人也被随意接触。缺乏集体的共识和抵抗，无法抵消这些侵扰，无法抵御对你们基本权利的任何侵犯。这种情况必须改变。而改变必须从某个人开始。它必须从你和那些像你一样具有更大觉知和敏感性的人开始。它必须从那些能够对我们的讯息做出回应的人开始，拥有内在的信任并知道我们所说的真理的人开始。</p>
