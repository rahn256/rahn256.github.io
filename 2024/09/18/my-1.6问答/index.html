<p>注意：以下问题是许多最早阅读盟友资料的人们发送给新知识图书馆的。</p>
<hr>
<p>We feel that it is important, given the information that we have provided thus far, to respond to questions that must surely arise regarding our reality and the significance of the messages that we have come to give.</p>
<p>我们认为，鉴于我们迄今为止所提供的讯息，有必要对肯定会出现的有关我们的现实和我们所传递讯息的意义的问题做出回应。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Given the lack of hard evidence, why should people believe what you are telling them about the Intervention?”</p>
<p>”既然缺乏确凿的证据，人们为什么要相信你们所说的干预？“</p>
<p>First, there must be great evidence concerning the visitation to your world. We have been told that this is the case. Yet we have also been told by the Unseen Ones that people do not know how to understand the evidence and that they give it their own meaning—a meaning that they prefer to give it, a meaning that provides comfort and reassurance for the most part. We are certain that there is adequate evidence to verify that the Intervention is occurring in the world today if one takes the time to look and to investigate this matter. The fact that your governments or religious leaders do not reveal such things does not mean that such a great event is not occurring in your midst.</p>
<p>首先，关于对你们世界的访问，必然有大量的证据。我们被告知，情况的确如此。然而，我们也被不可见者告知，人们不知道如何理解这些证据，他们赋予了它们自己想要的意义——一种他们更愿意接受的意义，这种意义在大多数情况下提供了安慰和保证。我们确信，如果人们花时间去观察和调查这件事，现有的证据足以证实干预正在世界上发生。你们的政府或宗教领袖不透露这些事情，并不意味着这样一个重大事件没有在你们当中发生。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How can people know that you are real?”</p>
<p>“人们如何才能知道你们是真实的？”</p>
<p>Regarding our reality, we cannot demonstrate our physical presence to you, and so you must discern the meaning and the import of our words. At this point, it is not merely a matter of belief. It requires a greater recognition, a Knowledge, a resonance. The words we speak we believe are true, but that does not assure that they can be received as such. We cannot control the response to our message. There are people who require more evidence than can possibly be given. For others, such evidence will not be necessary, for they will feel an inner confirmation.</p>
<p>关于我们的现实，我们无法向你们展示我们的实体存在，因此你们必须辨别我们话语的意义和重要性。此刻，这不仅仅是一个信仰的问题。它需要一种更大的认知，一种内识，一种共鸣。我们所说的话，我们相信是真实的，但这并不保证它们能被接纳。我们无法控制人们对我们讯息的回应。有些人需要更多的证据，而这些证据是不可能提供的。而对于另一些人来说，这种证据并不必要，因为他们会感受到内在的确认。</p>
<p>In the meantime, perhaps we remain a controversy, and yet we hope and we trust that our words can be considered seriously and that the evidence that does exist, which is substantial, can be gathered and understood by those who are willing to give this their effort and their focus in life. From our perspective, there is no greater problem, challenge and opportunity to receive your attention.</p>
<p>与此同时，也许我们仍然是一个争议的焦点，然而我们希望，并信任我们的话语可以被认真对待，而确实存在的证据，这些大量的证据，能够被那些愿意在他们的生活中付出努力和专注的人们所收集和理解。从我们的角度来看，没有比这更大的问题、挑战和机会来获得你们的关注了。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are at the beginning of a new understanding. This does require faith and self-reliance. Many will reject our words simply because they do not believe that we could possibly exist.</p>
<p>因此，你们正处于一种新的理解的开始。这确实需要信心和自力更生。许多人会拒绝我们的话，仅仅因为他们不相信我们可能存在。</p>
<p>Others perhaps will think that we are part of some manipulation that is being cast upon the world. We cannot control these responses. We can only reveal our message and our presence in your life, however removed that presence may be. It is not our presence here that is of paramount importance, but the message that we have come to reveal and the greater perspective and understanding that we can provide for you. Your education must begin somewhere. All education begins with the desire to know.</p>
<p>其他人或许会认为，我们是正在对世界进行操纵的一部分。我们无法控制这些回应。我们只能揭示我们的讯息和我们在你们生命中的存在，无论这种存在多么遥远。这里最重要的并不是我们的存在，而是我们要揭示的讯息，以及我们能够为你们提供的更广阔的视角和理解。你们的教育必须从某个地方开始。所有的教育都始于求知的欲望。</p>
<p>We hope that through our discourses we can gain at least part of your confidence in order to begin to reveal what we are here to offer.</p>
<p>我们希望通过我们的论述，至少能够赢得你们的一部分信任，以便开始揭示我们所要提供的内容。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What do you have to say to those who view the Intervention as a positive thing?”</p>
<p>“对于那些将干预视为积极因素的人，你们有什么要说的吗？”</p>
<p>We understand, first of all, the expectation that all forces from the heavens are related to your spiritual understanding, traditions and fundamental beliefs. The idea that there is prosaic life in the universe is a challenge to these fundamental assumptions. From our perspective and given the experience of our own cultures, we understand these expectations. In the distant past, we maintained them ourselves. And yet we had to relinquish them in facing the realities of Greater Community life and the meaning of visitation.</p>
<p>首先，我们理解这样的期望：所有来自天国的力量都与你们的精神理解、传统和基本信仰有关。宇宙中存在平凡生命的想法对这些基本假设构成了挑战。从我们的角度来看，鉴于我们自身文化的经历，我们理解这些期望。在遥远的过去，我们自己也曾持有这些期望。然而，在面对大社区生命的现实和访问的意义时，我们不得不放弃它们。</p>
<p>You live in a great physical universe. It is full of life. This life represents countless manifestations and also represents the evolution of intelligence and spiritual awareness at every level. What this means is that what you will encounter in the Greater Community encompasses almost every possibility.</p>
<p>你们生活在一个伟大的物理宇宙中。它充满了生命。这种生命代表了无数的表现形式，也代表了每个层级的智能生命和精神觉知的进化。这意味着你们在大社区里将遇到的生命几乎包含了所有的可能性。</p>
<p>However, you are isolated and do not yet travel in space. And even if you had the capability to reach another world, the universe is vast, and no one has gained the ability to go from one end of the galaxy to the other with any kind of speed. Therefore, the physical universe remains enormous and incomprehensible. No one has mastered its laws. No one has conquered its territories. No one can claim complete dominance or control. Life has a great humbling effect in this way. Even far beyond your borders this is true.</p>
<p>然而，你们处于孤立状态，还不能在太空中旅行。即使你们有能力到达另一个世界，宇宙是如此广袤，没有人有能力以任何速度从银河系的一端到达另一端。因此，物理宇宙仍然是巨大和不可理解的。没有人掌握了它的规律，没有人征服了它的领土，没有人可以声称拥有完全的主导权或控制权。生命以这种方式产生了伟大的谦逊效应。即使在你们的边界之外，这也是事实。</p>
<p>You should then come to expect that you will meet intelligences representing forces for good, forces for ignorance and those who are more neutral regarding you. However, in the realities of Greater Community travel and exploration, emerging races such as your own will, almost without exception, encounter resource explorers, collectives and those seeking advantage for themselves as their first contact with Greater Community life.</p>
<p>这样，你们就会遇到代表善的力量、代表无知的力量以及对你们持中立态度的智能生命。然而，在大社区旅行和探索的现实中，像你们这样的新兴种族，在与大社区生命的第一次接触中，几乎无一例外地会遇到资源勘探者、集体组织以及那些寻求自身利益的种族。</p>
<p>Regarding the positive interpretation of visitation, part of this is human expectation and the natural desire to welcome a good outcome and to seek help from the Greater Community for the problems that humanity has not been able to resolve on its own. It is normal to expect such things, particularly when you are considering that your visitors have greater capabilities than do you. However, a large part of the problem in interpreting the great visitation has to do with the will and the agenda of the visitors themselves. For they are encouraging people everywhere to view their presence here as wholly beneficial to humanity and to its needs.</p>
<p>关于对访问的积极解释，部分原因在于人类的期望，以及自然渴望迎接一个好的结果，并寻求大社区的帮助，以解决人类自身无法解决的问题。期待这样的情况是正常的，尤其是当你们考虑到来访者拥有比你们更大的能力时。然而，解释大社区访问的很大一部分问题与来访者本身的意愿和议程有关。因为他们正在鼓励各地的人们把他们在这里的存在视为对人类及其需求的全然有益。</p>
<hr>
<p>“If this Intervention is so well underway, why didn’t you come sooner?”</p>
<p>“如果这种干预已经进行得如此深入，为什么你们没有早点到来？”</p>
<p>At an earlier time, many years ago, several groups of your allies came to your world to visit in an attempt to give a message of hope, to prepare humanity. But alas their messages could not be understood and were misused by those few who could receive them. In the wake of their coming, the visitors from the collectives have amassed and gathered here. It has been known to us that this would happen, for your world is far too valuable to be overlooked, and, as we have said, it does not exist in a remote and distant part of the universe. Your world has been observed for a long time by those who would seek to use it for their own benefit.</p>
<p>许多年前，你们的一些盟友曾来到这个世界，试图传达希望的讯息，以准备人类。但遗憾的是，他们的讯息未能被理解，并被那些少数能够接收的人所滥用。在他们到来之后，来自集体组织的来访者聚集到了这里。我们早已知道这种情况会发生，因为你们的世界太有价值，不可能被忽视。正如我们所说，它并不位于宇宙的偏远角落。那些试图利用这个世界谋取自身利益的存在，已经观察你们的世界很久了。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Why can’t our allies stop the Intervention?”</p>
<p>“为什么我们的盟友不能阻止这种干预？”</p>
<p>We are only here to observe and to advise. The great decisions facing humanity are in your hands. No one else can make these decisions for you. Even your great friends far beyond your world would not intervene, for if they did so, it would cause warfare, and your world would become a battleground between opposing forces. And should your friends be victorious, you would become wholly reliant upon them, unable to fend for yourself or to maintain your own security in the universe. We know of no benevolent race that would seek to bear this burden. And, in truth, it would not serve you either.</p>
<p>我们在这里只是为了观察和提供建议。人类面临的重大决策掌握在你们自己手中，其他种族无法替你们做出这些决定。即使是你们遥远的伟大朋友也不会进行干预，因为如果他们这样做了，就会引发战争，你们的世界将成为对立势力之间的战场。而且，即使你们的朋友获胜，你们也会变得完全依赖他们，无法在宇宙中独立维持自身的安全。据我们所知，没有哪个仁慈的种族愿意承担这个重担。事实上，这对你们也没有好处。</p>
<p>For you would become a client state to another power and would have to be governed from afar. This is not beneficial for you in any way, and it is for this reason that this is not occurring. Yet the visitors will cast themselves as saviors and rescuers of humanity. They will utilize your naiveté. They will capitalize on your expectations, and they will seek to wholly benefit from your trust.</p>
<p>因为这样的话，你们将成为另一个势力的附庸国，必须从远方接受治理。这对你们没有任何益处，因此这才没有发生。然而，那些来访者会把自己包装成人类的救世主和拯救者。他们会利用你们的天真，迎合你们的期待，并寻求从你们的信任中完全受益。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is our sincere desire that our words can serve as an antidote to their presence and to their manipulation and abuse. For your rights are being violated. Your territory is being infiltrated. Your governments are being persuaded. And your religious ideologies and impulses are being redirected.</p>
<p>因此，我们真诚地希望我们的话语能够成为他们的存在以及他们的操纵和虐待的解药。因为你们的权利正在被侵犯，你们的领土正在被渗透，你们的政府正在被说服，而你们的宗教信仰和冲动正在被重新引导。</p>
<p>There must be a voice of truth regarding this. And we can only trust that you can receive this voice of truth. We can only hope that the persuasion has not gone too far.</p>
<p>对此，必须有一个真理的声音。我们只能信任，你们能够接收这种真理的声音。我们只能希望，说服并没有取得太大的效果。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What are realistic goals for us to set, and what is the bottom line with regard to saving humanity from losing its self-determination?”</p>
<p>”对我们来说，什么是现实的目标，关于拯救人类不失去自决权的底线是什么？“</p>
<p>The first step is awareness. Many people must become aware that the Earth is being visited and that foreign powers are here operating in a clandestine manner, seeking to hide their agenda and endeavors from human understanding. It must be very clear that their presence here is a great challenge to human freedom and self-determination. The agenda that they are furthering and the Pacification Program that they are sponsoring must be countered with sobriety and wisdom regarding their presence. This counteraction must occur. There are many people in the world today who are able to understand this. Therefore, the first step is awareness.</p>
<p>第一步是提高觉知。许多人必须察觉到地球正在被外星力量访问，而且这些外来力量正在秘密活动，试图将他们的议程和努力隐藏在人类的理解之外。必须非常清楚，他们的存在对人类的自由和自决权构成了巨大的挑战。他们正在推进的议程和他们所支持的安抚计划必须以清醒和智慧来对抗。这种反制行动必须发生。如今世界上有许多人能够理解这一点。因此，第一步是提高觉知。</p>
<p>The next step is education. It is necessary for many people in different cultures and in different nations to learn about life in the Greater Community and to begin to comprehend what you will be dealing with and are dealing with even at this moment.</p>
<p>下一步是教育。对于来自不同文化和国家的人们，学习大社区的生命是必要的，以便理解你们即将面对的情况，以及目前正在经历的挑战。</p>
<p>Therefore, realistic goals are awareness and education. This in itself would obstruct the visitors’ agenda in the world. They are operating now with very little resistance. They are encountering few obstacles. All those who seek to view them as “allies of humanity” must learn that this is not the case. Perhaps our words will not be enough, but they are a beginning.</p>
<p>因此，现实的目标是觉知和教育。这本身就会阻碍来访者在世界的议程。他们现在几乎没有遇到任何阻力。他们面临的障碍很少。所有视他们为“人类盟友”的人都必须了解，事实并非如此。也许我们的话语是不够的，但它们是一个开始。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Where can we find this education?”</p>
<p>“我们在哪里可以找到这种教育？”</p>
<p>The education can be found in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, which is being presented in the world at this time. Though it presents a new understanding about life and spirituality in the universe, it is connected to all of the genuine spiritual paths that already exist within your world—spiritual paths that value human freedom and the meaning of true spirituality and that value cooperation, peace and harmony within the human family. Therefore, the teaching in The Way of Knowledge calls forth all the great truths that already exist in your world and gives them a greater context and arena of expression. In this way, The Greater Community Way of Knowledge does not replace the world’s religions, but provides a larger context within which they can be truly meaningful and relevant to your times.</p>
<p>这种教育可以在大社区的内识之路中找到，它此时正在世界范围内呈现。虽然它提出了关于宇宙中的生命和精神性的新理解，但它与你们世界中已经存在的所有真正的精神道路相联系——那些重视人类自由、真实精神性的意义，以及重视人类大家庭中的合作、和平与和谐的精神道路。因此，内识之路的教导召唤出你们世界中已经存在的所有伟大真理，并为它们提供了一个更广阔的背景和表达的舞台。通过这种方式，大社区的内识之路并不取代世界的宗教，而是为它们提供了一个更大的背景，使其在你们的时代中真正具有意义和相关性。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How do we convey your message to others?”</p>
<p>“我们如何将你们的讯息传达给他人？”</p>
<p>The truth lives within each person at this moment. If you can speak to the truth in a person, it will become stronger and begin to resonate. Our great hope, the hope of the Unseen Ones, the spiritual forces who serve your world, and the hope of those who value human freedom and wish to see your emergence into the Greater Community successfully fulfilled, rely upon this truth that lives within each person. We cannot force this awareness upon you. We can only reveal it to you and trust in the greatness of Knowledge that the Creator has given you that can enable you and others to respond.</p>
<p>真理此刻就生活在每个人的内心深处。如果你能对一个人的内在真理进行说话，它就会变得更强大，并开始产生共鸣。我们的伟大希望——不可见者（那些服务于你们世界的精神力量）以及那些珍视人类自由、希望看到你们成功进入大社区的种族的希望——都依赖于生活在每个人内心深处的这个真理。我们无法将这种觉知强加于你们。我们只能将它揭示给你们，并信任造物主赐予你们的伟大内识，这种内识将使你和他人能够做出回应。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Where do humanity’s strengths lie in opposing the Intervention?”</p>
<p>“在反对干预方面，人类的优势在哪里？”</p>
<p>First, we understand from observing your world, and from what the Unseen Ones have told us regarding things that we cannot see, that though there are great problems within the world, there is sufficient human freedom to give you a foundation for opposing the Intervention. This is in contrast to many other worlds where individual freedom was never established to begin with. As these worlds encounter alien forces in their midst and the reality of Greater Community life, the possibility for them to establish freedom and independence is very limited.</p>
<p>首先，我们通过观察你们的世界，以及通过不可见者传达给我们的那些我们无法直接观察到的信息。我们了解到，尽管世界上存在巨大的问题，但人类拥有足够的自由，这为你们反对干预提供了基础。这与许多其他世界形成了对比，在那些世界中，个人自由从未得到确立。当这些世界在自身环境中遭遇外星势力以及大社区生命的现实时，它们建立自由和独立的可能性是非常有限的。</p>
<p>Therefore, you have a great strength in that human freedom is known in your world and is valued by many, though perhaps not all. You know you have something to lose. You value what you have already, to whatever extent it has been established. You do not want to be ruled by foreign powers. You do not even want to be ruled harshly by human authorities. Therefore, this is a beginning.</p>
<p>因此，你们拥有巨大的力量，因为人类的自由在你们的世界中是被知道并被许多人珍视的，尽管可能并非所有人都是如此。你们知道自己有可能失去一些东西。你们珍视已经建立的一切，无论程度如何。你们不想被外来力量统治，甚至不想被人类当局粗暴地统治。因此，这是一个开始。</p>
<p>Next, because your world has rich spiritual traditions that have fostered Knowledge in the individual and fostered human cooperation and understanding, the reality of Knowledge has already been established. Again, in other worlds where Knowledge was never established, the possibility for establishing it at the turning point of emerging into the Greater Community shows little hope for success. Knowledge is strong enough in enough people here that they may be able to learn of the reality of life in the Greater Community and to comprehend what is occurring in their midst at this time. It is for this reason that we are hopeful, for we trust in human wisdom. We trust that people can rise above selfishness, self-preoccupation and self-protection to view life in a greater way and to feel a greater responsibility in service to their own kind.</p>
<p>其次，因为你们的世界拥有丰富的精神传统，这些传统培养了个人的内识，促进了人类的合作与理解，内识的现实已经确立。同样，在其他世界中，内识从未被建立，在它们进入大社区的关键时刻建立内识的可能性是微乎其微的。这里有足够多的人具备足够强大的内识，他们能够学习大社区生命的现实，并理解此刻正在他们当中发生的事情。正因为如此，我们充满希望，因为我们信任人类的智慧。我们相信人们可以超越自私、自我关注和自我保护，以更广阔的方式看待生命，并在为自己的同类服务中感到更大的责任。</p>
<p>Perhaps our faith is unfounded, but we are trusting that the Unseen Ones have counseled us wisely regarding this. As a result, we have placed ourselves at risk by being in the proximity of your world and witnessing events beyond your borders that have direct bearing on your future and destiny.</p>
<p>也许我们的信念是没有依据的，但我们信任不可见者，在这方面给我们提供了明智的建议。因此，我们冒着风险靠近你们的世界，见证在你们边界之外发生的、对你们的未来和天命有直接影响的事件。</p>
<p>Humanity has great promise. You have a growing awareness of problems in the world—the lack of cooperation amongst nations, the degradation of your natural environment, your diminishing resources and so forth. If these problems were unknown to your people, if these realities had been kept hidden from your people, to the extent that people had no idea of the existence of these things, then we would not be as hopeful. However, the reality remains that humanity has the potential and the promise to counteract any intervention into the world.</p>
<p>人类有伟大的承诺。你们对世界问题的觉知正在不断加深——国家之间缺乏合作、自然环境的恶化、资源的减少等等。如果这些问题对你们的人们来说是未知的，如果这些现实一直被隐藏，以至于人们根本不知道这些事情的存在，那么我们就不会如此充满希望。然而，现实情况仍然是，人类有潜力和承诺来抵制对世界的任何干预。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Is this Intervention going to become a military invasion?”</p>
<p>“这种干预会变成军事入侵吗？”</p>
<p>As we have said, your world is too valuable to incite a military invasion. No one who is visiting your world wants to destroy its infrastructure or its natural resources. That is why the visitors do not seek to destroy humanity, but instead to engage humanity in service to their collectives.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，你们的世界太具有价值，不可能煽动军事入侵。访问你们世界的种族都不想破坏地球的基础设施或自然资源。这就是为什么来访者不寻求摧毁人类，而是让人类为他们的集体服务。</p>
<p>It is not military invasion that threatens you. It is the power of inducement and persuasion. This will be built upon your own weakness, upon your own selfishness, upon your ignorance of life in the Greater Community and upon your blind optimism regarding your future and the meaning of life beyond your borders.</p>
<p>威胁你们的不是军事入侵。而是引诱和说服的力量。它将建立在你们自身的弱点之上，建立在你们自身的自私之上，建立在你们对大社区生命的无知之上，建立在你们对自己的未来和你们边界之外的生命意义的盲目乐观之上。</p>
<p>To counteract this, we provide education and we speak of the means of preparation that are being sent into the world at this time. If you did not already know human freedom, if you were not already aware of the problems endemic to your world, then we could not entrust such a preparation to you. And we would not have confidence that our words would resonate with the truth of what you know.</p>
<p>为了抵制干预，我们提供教育，我们谈到了此时被发送给世界的准备方式。如果你们还不知道人类的自由，如果你们还不知道你们世界特有的问题，那我们就不能把这种准备工作交给你们。我们也不会有信心让我们的话语与你们所知道的真理产生共鸣。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Can you influence people as powerfully as the visitors, but for the good?”</p>
<p>“你们能像来访者那样强有力地影响人们，但目的却是为了做善事吗？”</p>
<p>Our intention is not to influence individuals. Our intention is only to present the problem and the reality into which you are emerging. The Unseen Ones are providing the actual means of preparation, for that comes from the Creator of all life. In this, the Unseen Ones influence individuals for the good. But there are restraints. As we have said, it is your self-determination that must be strengthened. It is your power that must be increased. It is your cooperation amongst the human family that must be supported.</p>
<p>我们的意图不是去影响个人。我们的意图仅仅是呈现你们所面临的问题和你们正在进入的现实。不可见者正在提供实际的准备方式，因为这来自于所有生命的创造者。在这方面，不可见者确实为了做善事而影响个人。但这是有约束的。正如我们所说，你们的自决权必须得到加强。你们的力量必须得到增强。人类大家庭之间的合作必须得到支持。</p>
<p>There are limits as to how much help we can provide. Our group is small. We are not walking amongst you. Therefore, the great understanding of your new reality must be shared from person to person. It cannot be forced upon you from a foreign power, even if it were for your own good. We would not, then, be supporting your freedom and self-determination if we sponsored such a program of persuasion. Here you cannot be like children. You must become mature and responsible. It is your freedom that is at stake. It is your world that is at stake. It is your cooperation with each other that is needed.</p>
<p>我们所能提供的帮助是有限的。我们的团队规模很小，我们没有在你们中间行走。因此，对你们新现实的伟大理解必须在人与人之间分享。它不能由外来力量强加给你们，即便这对你们有利。如果我们推动这样一个说服计划，那我们就不会支持你们的自由和自决权。在这里，你们不能像孩子一样。你们必须变得成熟和负责任。这事关你们的自由。这关系到你们的世界。需要的是你们彼此之间的合作。</p>
<p>You now have a great cause to unite your race, for none of you will benefit without the other. No nation will benefit if any other nation falls under alien control. Human freedom must be complete. The cooperation must occur around your world. For everyone is in the same situation now. The visitors do not favor one group over another, one race over another, one nation over another. They only seek the avenue of least resistance to establish their presence and their domination of your world.</p>
<p>现在，你们有一个伟大的理由来团结你们的种族，因为没有你们中的任何一个人可以独自获益。如果任何一个国家落入外星控制之下，其他国家也无法获益。人类的自由必须是完整的。这种合作必须在你们的世界范围内发生。因为现在每个人都处于相同的境地。来访者不会偏袒某个群体、某个种族或某个国家。他们只是在寻找阻力最小的途径，以建立他们的存在并支配你们的世界。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How extensive is their infiltration of humanity?”</p>
<p>“他们对人类的渗透有多广泛？”</p>
<p>The visitors have a significant presence within the most advanced nations in your world, particularly the nations of Europe, Russia, Japan and the United States. These are viewed as the strongest nations, having the greatest power and influence. It is there that the visitors will concentrate. However, they are taking people from all over the world, and they are furthering their Pacification Program with all those that they capture, if those individuals can be responsive to their influence. Therefore, the visitors’ presence is worldwide, but they are concentrating on those whom they hope will become their allies. These are the nations and governments and religious leaders who hold the greatest power and sway over human thought and conviction.</p>
<p>来访者在你们世界最先进的国家中有显著存在，特别是欧洲、俄罗斯、日本和美国。这些国家被视为最强大的国家，拥有最大的权力和影响力。来访者将会集中在这些地方。然而，他们也在从全球范围内带走人们，并对所有被他们捕获的人推进他们的安抚计划，只要这些个体能够对他们的影响做出回应。因此，来访者的存在是全球性的，但他们主要集中在那些他们希望成为盟友的地方。这些国家、政府和宗教领袖在影响人类思想和信仰方面拥有最大的权力和影响力。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How much time do we have?”</p>
<p>“我们还有多少时间？”</p>
<p>How much time do you have? You have some time, how much we cannot tell. But we come with an urgent message. This is not a problem that can simply be avoided or denied. From our perspective, it is the most important challenge facing humanity. It is of the greatest concern, the first priority. You are late in your preparation. This was caused by many factors beyond our control. But there is time, if you can respond. The outcome is uncertain and yet there is still hope for your success.</p>
<p>你们还有一些时间，但具体有多少时间我们无法确定。但是，我们带来了一个紧急的讯息。这不是一个可以简单回避或否认的问题。在我们看来，这是人类面临的最重要的挑战。它是最值得关注的、首要的优先权。你们在准备上已经迟到了。这是由许多我们无法控制的因素造成的。但如果你们能够做出回应，仍然有时间。结果是不确定的，然而你们仍有成功的希望。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How can we focus on this Intervention given the immensity of other global problems which are occurring right now?”</p>
<p>“在当前其他全球性问题如此严重的情况下，我们如何能把注意力集中在这次干预？”</p>
<p>First of all, we feel that there are no other problems in the world that are as important as this. From our perspective, whatever you can resolve on your own will have little meaning in the future if your freedom is lost. What could you hope to gain? What could you hope to achieve or secure if you are not free in the Greater Community? All of your accomplishments would be given to your new governors; all of your wealth would be bestowed upon them. And though your visitors are not cruel, they are completely committed to their agenda. You are valued only insofar as you can be useful to their cause. It is for this reason that we do not feel that there are any other problems facing humanity as important as this.</p>
<p>首先，我们认为世界上没有其他问题比这个问题更重要。从我们的角度来看，如果你们失去了自由，无论你们自己能解决什么问题，在未来都没有什么意义。你们能希望获得什么？如果你们在大社区中没有自由，你们能希望实现或确保什么呢？你们所有的成就都将交给新的统治者；你们所有的财富也将归于他们。尽管你们的来访者并不残忍，但他们完全致力于自己的议程。你们的价值仅仅在于你们能否对他们的事业有用。这就是为什么我们认为没有其他问题比这个问题更重要的原因。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Who is likely to respond to this situation?”</p>
<p>“谁有可能对这种情况做出回应？”</p>
<p>Regarding who can respond, there are many people in the world today who have an inherent knowledge of the Greater Community and who are sensitive to it. There are many others who have been taken by the visitors already but who have not yielded to them or to their persuasion. And there are many others who are concerned about the future of the world and who are alerted to the dangers that humanity faces. People in all or any of these three categories may be amongst the first to respond to the Greater Community reality and to the preparation for the Greater Community. They may come from any walk of life, from any nation, from any religious background or from any economic group. They are literally all over the world. It is upon them and upon their response that the great Spiritual Powers that protect and oversee human welfare are depending.</p>
<p>关于谁可以回应这个情况，当今世界上有许多人天生对大社区有一种内在的认识，并对其敏感。还有许多人已经被来访者带走，但他们没有屈服于他们的影响或说服。还有许多人关心世界的未来，并对人类面临的危险有所警觉。所有这些类别中的人都可能是最早回应大社区现实并为大社区做准备的人。他们可以来自任何社会阶层、任何国家、任何宗教背景或任何经济集体。他们实际上遍布世界各地。保护和监督人类福祉的伟大精神力量正是依靠他们以及他们的回应。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You mention that individuals are being taken all over the world. How can people protect themselves or others from being abducted?”</p>
<p>“你们提到世界各地都有人被绑架。人们该如何保护自己或他人不被绑架？”</p>
<p>The more you can become strong with Knowledge and aware of the visitors’ presence, the less you become a desirable subject for their study and manipulation. The more you use your encounters with them to gain insight into them, the more of a hazard you become. As we have said, they seek the path of least resistance. They want individuals who are compliant and yielding. They want those who cause them few problems and little concern.</p>
<p>你越能成为内识的强者，你就越能察觉到来访者的存在，你就越不会成为他们研究和操纵的理想对象。你越是利用与你们的来访者接触来获得对他们的洞察力，你就越会成为他们的威胁。正如我们所说，他们寻求阻力最小的途径。他们想要的是顺从和屈服的个体。他们希望这些人给他们带来很少的麻烦和很少的困扰。</p>
<p>Yet as you become strong with Knowledge, you will be beyond their control because now they cannot capture your mind or your heart. And with time, you will have the power of perception to see into their minds, which they do not wish. You then become a danger to them, a challenge to them, and they will avoid you if they can.</p>
<p>然而，当你因内识而变得强大时，你就会在他们的控制之外，因为他们无法捕获你的心灵和内心。随着时间的推移，你将拥有感知的能力，能够看到他们的心灵，而这是他们所不希望的。你因此成为他们的威胁，成为他们的挑战，如果可以，他们会避开你。</p>
<p>The visitors do not want to be revealed. They do not wish for conflict. They are overly confident that they can achieve their goals without serious resistance from the human family. But once such resistance is mounted, once the power of Knowledge awakens in the individual, then the visitors are facing a much more formidable obstacle. Their intervention here becomes thwarted and more difficult to achieve. And their persuasion of those in power becomes more difficult to accomplish. Therefore, it is the individual’s response and commitment to the truth that are essential here.</p>
<p>来访者不希望被揭露。他们不希望发生冲突。他们过于自信，认为可以在没有人类大家族严重抵抗的情况下实现他们的目标。但是一旦有了这种抵抗，一旦内识的力量在个人身上醒来，那来访者就会面临一个更为强大的障碍。他们在这里的干预变得受挫，更加难以实现。他们对当权者的说服也变得更加难以实现。因此，个人对真理的回应和承诺在这里是至关重要的。</p>
<p>Become aware of the visitors’ presence. Do not yield to the persuasion that their presence here is of a spiritual nature or that it holds great benefit or salvation for humanity. Resist the persuasion. Regain your own inner authority, the great gift that the Creator has given to you. Become a force to be reckoned with regarding any who would trespass against or deny your fundamental rights.</p>
<p>要察觉到来访者的存在。不要屈服于这样的说服，即他们的存在具有精神性质，或对人类有很大的益处或救赎。抵制这种说服。重拾你自己的内在权威，这是造物主赋予你的伟大礼物。对于任何侵犯或否认你们的基本权利的存在，你要成为一股不可忽视的力量。</p>
<p>This is Spiritual Power being expressed. It is the Will of the Creator that humanity should emerge into the Greater Community united within itself and free from foreign intervention and domination. It is the Creator’s Will that you should prepare for a future that will be unlike your past. We are here in service to the Creator, and thus our presence and our words serve this purpose.</p>
<p>这是精神力量的体现。它是造物主的意志，人类应该出现在大社区中，在自己内部团结起来，不受外来的干预和统治。造物主的意志是你们应为一个不同于过去的未来做好准备。我们在这里为造物主服务，因此我们的存在和我们的话语都是为了这个目的。</p>
<hr>
<p>“If the visitors encounter resistance in humanity or in certain individuals, will they come in greater numbers or will they leave?”</p>
<p>“如果来访者在与人类或某些个体接触时遇到抵抗，他们会以更大的数量来临，还是会离开？”</p>
<p>Their numbers are not great. Should they encounter considerable resistance, they would have to fall back and make new plans. They are wholly confident that their mission can be fulfilled without serious obstacles. Yet should serious obstacles arise, then their intervention and persuasion would be thwarted, and they would have to find other ways of gaining contact with humanity.</p>
<p>他们的数量并不多。如果他们遇到相当大的抵抗，他们将不得不撤退并制定新的计划。他们完全相信他们的使命可以在没有严重障碍的情况下完成。然而，如果出现了严重的障碍，他们的干预和说服就会受挫，他们将不得不寻找其他方式与人类取得联系。</p>
<p>We trust that the human family can generate enough resistance and enough consensus in order to offset these influences. It is upon this that we are basing our hope and efforts.</p>
<p>我们信任，人类大家庭能够产生足够的阻力和足够的共识，以抵消这些影响。我们的希望和努力正是基于此。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What are the most important questions that we must ask of ourselves and others with respect to this problem of alien infiltration?”</p>
<p>“对于外星势力渗透这个问题，我们必须问自己和他人的最重要问题是什么？”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most critical questions to ask yourself are, “Are we humans alone within the universe or in our own world? Are we being visited at this time? Is this visitation beneficial to us? Do we need to prepare?</p>
<p>也许要问自己的最关键问题是：”我们人类是在宇宙中还是在我们自己的世界里？我们在这个时候被访问了吗？这种访问对我们有利吗？我们需要做好准备吗？</p>
<p>These are very fundamental questions, but they must be asked. There are many questions, however, that cannot be answered, for you do not know enough about life in the Greater Community, and you are not yet confident that you have the ability to counteract these influences. There are many things lacking in human education, which is primarily focused upon the past. Humanity is emerging from a long state of relative isolation. Its education, its values and its institutions were all established within this state of isolation. Yet your isolation now is over, forever. It was always known that this would happen. It was inevitable that this would be the case. Therefore, your education and your values are entering into a new context, to which they must adapt. And the adaptation must happen quickly because of the nature of the Intervention in the world today.</p>
<p>这些都是非常基本的问题，但它们必须被提出来。然而，有许多问题是无法回答的，因为你们对大社区中的生命知道的还不够多，而且你们尚未确信自己有能力抵御这些影响。在人类的教育中，有许多教育是缺乏的，主要是因为它关注的是过去。人类正从相对孤立的长期状态中走出来。人类的教育、价值观和制度都是在这种孤立状态下建立的。然而，现在这种孤立已经永远结束了。人们一直知道这将会发生，这是不可避免的。因此，你们的教育和价值观正在进入一个新的环境，必须对此进行适应。而且由于当今世界干预的性质，这种适应必须迅速进行。</p>
<p>There will be many questions that you cannot answer. You will have to live with them. Your education about the Greater Community is only at the very beginning. You must approach it with great sobriety and care. You must counteract your own tendencies to try and make the situation pleasant or reassuring. You must develop an objectivity about life, and you must look beyond your own personal sphere of interests in order to put yourself in a position to respond to the greater forces and events that are shaping your world and your future.</p>
<p>将有许多问题是你们无法回答的。你们将不得不与它们共存。你们关于大社区的教育只是刚刚开始。你们必须以高度的清醒和谨慎来对待它。你们必须克服自己的倾向，不要试图让情况变得令人愉快或令人安心。你们必须发展对生命的客观性，你们必须超越个人的兴趣范围，使自己能够对塑造你们的世界和未来的更大力量和事件做出回应。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What if enough people cannot respond?”</p>
<p>“如果没有足够的人做出回应怎么办？”</p>
<p>We are confident that enough people can respond and begin their great education about life in the Greater Community in order to give promise and hope to the human family. If this cannot be achieved, then those who value their freedom and who have this education will have to retreat. They will have to keep Knowledge alive in the world as the world falls under complete control. This is a very grave alternative, and yet it has occurred in other worlds. The journey back to freedom from such a position is quite difficult. We hope that this will not be your fate, and that is why we are here giving you this information. As we have said, there are enough people in the world who can respond to offset the intentions of the visitors and to thwart their influence on human affairs and human values.</p>
<p>我们有信心，有足够的人可以做出回应，开始他们关于大社区生命的伟大教育，以便给人类大家庭带来承诺和希望。如果这无法实现，那么那些珍视自由并获得了这种教育的人将不得不退隐。他们将不得不在这个世界上保持内识的活力，因为这个世界完全被控制了。这是一个非常严峻的选择，但它已经在其他世界发生。从这样的位置返回到自由的旅程是相当困难的。我们希望这不会是你的命运，这就是为什么我们在这里给你们这些信息。正如我们所说的，世界上有足够多的人可以做出回应，抵消来访者的意图，挫败他们对人类事务和人类价值观的影响。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You speak of other worlds emerging into the Greater Community. Can you speak of successes and failures which might have bearing on our situation?”</p>
<p>“你们提到其他世界正在进入大社区。你们能否谈谈那些可能与我们的处境有关的成功与失败？”</p>
<p>There have been successes or we would not be here. In my case, as the speaker for our group, our world had already been greatly infiltrated before we realized the situation at hand. Our education was prompted by the arrival of a group such as ourselves, providing insight and information about our situation. We had alien resource traders in our world interacting with our government. Those who were in power at that time were persuaded that trade and commerce would be beneficial to us, for we were beginning to experience resource depletion. Though our race was united, unlike your own, we began to be wholly dependent upon the new technology and opportunities that were being presented to us. And yet as this occurred, there was a shift in the center of power. We were becoming the clients. The visitors were becoming the providers. As time went on, terms and restrictions were placed upon us, subtly at first.</p>
<p>你们已经有了成功，否则我们就不会在这里。就我而言，作为我们小组的发言人，在我们意识到眼前的情况之前，我们的世界已经被大大渗透了。我们的教育是由一个像我们这样的团体的到来所促使的，提供了关于我们情况的洞察力和信息。我们的世界里有外星资源商人与我们的政府互动。当时的当权者已经被说服，认为贸易和商业对我们有利，因为我们开始面临资源的枯竭。虽然我们的种族是团结的，但与你们的种族不同，我们开始完全依赖新技术和呈现给我们的机会。然而，随着这种情况的发生，权力的中心发生了转移。我们正在成为客户。而来访者正在成为提供者。随着时间的推移，各种条款和限制被强加在我们身上，起初是微妙的。</p>
<p>Our religious focus and beliefs were also influenced by the visitors, who showed interest in our spiritual values but who wished to give us a new understanding, an understanding based upon the collective, based upon the cooperation of minds thinking alike in unison with each other. This was presented to our race as an expression of spirituality and achievement. Some were persuaded, and yet because we were well advised from our allies beyond our world, allies such as ourselves, we began to mount a resistance movement and over time were able to force the visitors to leave our world.</p>
<p>我们的宗教重点和信仰也受到来访者的影响，他们对我们的精神价值观表现出兴趣，但他们希望给我们一种新的理解，一种基于集体的理解，基于心灵思维的合作，以一种齐心协力的方式呈现给我们的种族，作为一种精神和成就的表达。一些人被说服了，然而，由于我们得到了来自我们世界之外盟友的良好建议，像我们这样的盟友，我们才开始发起抵抗运动，并逐渐迫使来访者离开我们的世界。</p>
<p>Since that time, we have learned a great deal about the Greater Community. The trade that we maintain is very selective, with only a few other nations. We have been able to avoid the collectives, and that has preserved our freedom. And yet our success was difficult to achieve, for there were many of us who had to die in the face of this conflict. Ours is a story of success, but not without cost. There are others in our group who have experienced similar difficulties in their interaction with intervening powers in the Greater Community. And yet because we eventually learned to travel beyond our borders, we gained alliance with one another. We were able to learn what spirituality means in the Greater Community. And the Unseen Ones, who serve our world as well, helped us in this regard to make the great transition from isolation to Greater Community awareness.</p>
<p>从那时起，我们对大社区有了很大的了解。我们维持的贸易是非常有选择性的，仅限于少数几个国家。我们已经能够避免集体力量，这保全了我们的自由。然而，我们的成功是来之不易的，因为在这场冲突中，许多人不得不付出生命的代价。我们的故事是一个成功的故事，但并非没有代价。在我们的团体中，还有其他成员在与大社区的干预力量的互动中经历了类似的困难。然而，由于我们最终学会了超越自身的边界，我们彼此建立了联盟。我们得以学习在大社区中精神性的意义。而不可见者同样也帮助了我们，使我们实现了从孤立到大社区觉知的伟大转变。</p>
<p>Yet there have been many failures that we are aware of. Cultures where the indigenous peoples had not established personal freedom or had not tasted the fruits of cooperation, even though they were advancing technologically, did not have a foundation to establish their own independence in the universe. Their ability to resist the collectives was very limited. Induced by promises of greater power, greater technology and greater wealth, and induced by the seeming benefits of trade in the Greater Community, their center of power left their world. In the end, they became wholly dependent upon those who supplied them and who gained control of their resources and their infrastructures.</p>
<p>然而，我们也知道许多失败的例子。有些文化的土著居民未能建立个人自由，或未能品尝到合作的果实，即使他们在技术上有所进步，也无法在宇宙中建立自己的独立地位。他们抵抗集体力量的能力非常有限。他们被承诺更大的权力、更先进的技术和更大的财富所诱惑，被大社区中看似有益的贸易所诱惑，最终他们的权力中心离开了他们的世界。最终，他们完全依赖于那些向他们提供资源和控制他们基础设施的种族。</p>
<p>Surely you can imagine how this could be the case. Even within your own world according to your history, you have seen smaller nations fall under the domination of greater ones. You can see this even today. Therefore, these ideas are not wholly foreign to you. In the Greater Community, as in your world, the strong will dominate the weak, if they can. This is a reality of life everywhere. And it is for this reason that we are encouraging your awareness and your preparation, in order that you may become strong and your self-determination may grow.</p>
<p>你们肯定能想象到这种情况的发生。即使在你们自己的世界，根据你们的历史，你们也曾见过小国落入更大国家的统治之下。即使在今天，你们也能看到这一点。因此，这些想法对你们来说并非完全陌生。在大社区中，就像在你们的世界一样，强者会支配弱者，如果他们可以的话。这是各地生命的现实。正因为如此，我们鼓励你们提高觉知并做好准备，以便你们能够变得强大，并增强你们的自决能力。</p>
<p>It may be a grave disappointment to many to understand and to learn that freedom is rare in the universe. As nations become stronger and more technological, they require greater and greater uniformity and compliance amongst their peoples. As they bridge out into the Greater Community and become involved in Greater Community affairs, the tolerance for individual expression diminishes to the point where large nations that have wealth and power are governed with a strictness and an exacting attitude that you would find abhorrent.</p>
<p>学习并理解到自由在宇宙中是稀缺的，可能会让许多人深感失望。随着国家变得更加强大和技术化，它们要求人民之间的一致性和服从性也会越来越高。当它们与大社区接轨并参与大社区的事务时，对个人表达的容忍度会下降到几乎为零，强大而富裕的国家往往以你们难以忍受的严格和精确态度进行治理。</p>
<p>Here you must learn that technological advancement and spiritual advancement are not the same, a lesson that humanity has yet to learn and which you must learn if you are to exercise your natural wisdom in these matters.</p>
<p>在这里，你们必须学会技术进步和精神进步是不一样的，这是人类尚未学到的一个教训，你们必须学习这个教训，如果你们希望在这些问题上运用你们的自然智慧。</p>
<p>Your world is greatly valued. It is rich biologically. You are sitting on a prize that you must protect if you are to be its stewards and its beneficiaries. Consider the peoples in your world who have lost their freedom because they lived in a place considered valuable by others. It is now the whole human family that is so imperiled.</p>
<p>你们的世界是非常具有价值的。它在生物上是非常丰富的。如果你们要成为它的管理人和受益人，你们就必须保护这个珍宝。想想你们世界上那些失去自由的人，因为他们生活在被其他人视为有价值的地方。现在是整个人类大家庭受到了如此的威胁。</p>

<p>“Because the visitors are so skilled in projecting thoughts and influencing people’s mental environment, how do we ensure ourselves that what we are seeing is real?”</p>
<p>“由于来访者在投射思想和影响人们的心理环境方面非常熟练，我们如何确保自己所看到的是真实的？”</p>
<p>The only basis for wise perception is the cultivation of Knowledge. If you believe only what you see, then you will believe only what is shown to you. There are many, we are told, that have this perspective. Yet we have learned that the wise everywhere must gain a greater vision and a greater discernment. It is true that your visitors can project images of your saints and of your religious figures. Though this is not practiced often, it certainly can be used in order to evoke commitment and dedication amongst those who are already given to such beliefs. Here your spirituality becomes an area of vulnerability where wisdom must be used.</p>
<p>明智感知的唯一基础是培养内识。如果你只相信你所看到的，那么你就只能相信被展示给你的现实。我们被告知，有很多人持有这种观点。然而，我们已经了解到，各地的智者都必须获得更大的视野和更高的辨别力。确实，你们的来访者可以投射出你们圣人和宗教人物的形象。虽然这种做法并不常见，但它肯定可以用来引起那些已经持有这种信仰的人的承诺和奉献。在这里，你们的精神性成为一个脆弱的领域，必须运用智慧。</p>
<p>Yet the Creator has given you Knowledge as a foundation for true discernment. You can know what you are seeing if you ask yourself if it is real. Yet to do this, you must have this foundation, and that is why the teaching in The Way of Knowledge is so fundamental to learning Greater Community Spirituality. Without this, people will believe what they want to believe, and they will rely upon what they see and what they are shown. And their potential for freedom will have been lost already, for it was never allowed to flourish in the first place.</p>
<p>然而，造物主已经赐予你们内识，作为真实辨别力的基础。如果你问自己所看到的是否是真实的，你是可以知道的。然而，要做到这一点，你必须有这个基础，这就是为什么内识之路的教导对学习大社区精神性如此重要。没有这个，人们会相信他们所想相信的现实，并依赖他们所看到的和被展示给他们的想法。他们的自由潜能早已丧失，因为它一开始就从未得以发展。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You speak about keeping Knowledge alive. How many will it take to keep Knowledge alive in the world?”</p>
<p>“你们谈到保持内识的活力。需要多少人才能在世界上保持内识的活力？”</p>
<p>We cannot give you a number, but it must be strong enough to generate a voice within your own cultures. If this message can only be received by a few, they will not have this voice or this strength. Here they must share their wisdom. It cannot be purely for their own edification. Many more must learn of this message, many more than can receive it today.</p>
<p>我们无法给出具体的数字，但内识必须足够强大，才能在你们自己的文化中产生一种声音。如果这个讯息只能被少数人所接受，他们将无法拥有这种声音或这种力量。在这里，他们必须分享他们的智慧，这不能仅仅是为了他们自己的启发。必须有更多的人学习这个讯息，远远超过今天能够接受它的人数。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Is there a danger in presenting this message?”</p>
<p>“传递这个讯息是否存在危险？”</p>
<p>There is always a danger in presenting the truth, not only in your world, but elsewhere. People gain advantage from the circumstances as they currently exist. The visitors will offer advantage to those in power who can receive them and who are not strong in Knowledge. People become accustomed to these advantages and build their lives upon them. This makes them resistant or even hostile to the presentation of truth, which calls for their responsibility in service to others and which may threaten the basis of their wealth and achievements.</p>
<p>传递真理总是存在危险，不仅在你们的世界，在其他地方也是如此。人们从当前的环境中获得利益。来访者将为那些能够接待他们且内识不够强大的当权者提供利益。人们习惯于这些利益，并以此为基础构建他们的生活。这使他们对真理的呈现产生抵触，甚至敌对，因为真理要求他们承担为他人服务的责任，这可能会威胁到他们财富和成就的基础。</p>
<p>This is why we are hidden and do not walk in your world. Certainly the visitors would destroy us if they could find us. But humanity may seek to destroy us as well because of what we represent, because of the challenge and the new reality that we demonstrate. Not everyone is ready to receive the truth even though it is greatly needed.</p>
<p>这就是为什么我们隐藏自己，并不在你们的世界中行走的原因。当然，如果来访者能找到我们，他们就会摧毁我们。但人类也可能试图摧毁我们，因为我们所代表的真理，因为我们所展示的挑战和新的现实。并不是每个人都准备好接受真理，尽管它非常需要。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Can individuals who are strong with Knowledge influence the visitors?”</p>
<p>“拥有强大内识的个人能否影响来访者？”</p>
<p>The chance of success here is very limited. You are dealing with a collective of beings who have been bred to be compliant, whose whole life and experience have been encompassed and engendered by a collective mentality. They do not think for themselves. For this reason, we do not feel that you can influence them. There are few amongst the human family who have the strength to do this, and even here the possibility for success would be very limited. So the answer must be “No.” For all practical purposes, you cannot win them over.</p>
<p>在这方面成功的机会非常有限。你们正在与一群被培养成服从的生命集体打交道，他们的整个生命和经验都被集体心理所包围和培养。他们不会独立思考。正因为如此，我们认为你们无法影响他们。在整个人类大家庭中，只有极少数人具备这样做的力量，即便如此，成功的可能性也非常有限。因此，答案必须是“不能。”就所有的实际目的而言，你们无法赢得他们。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How are collectives different from a united humanity?”</p>
<p>“集体与统一的人类有什么不同？”</p>
<p>Collectives are made up of different races and of those who are bred to serve those races. Many of the beings that are being encountered in the world are bred by collectives to be servants. Their genetic heritage has long been lost to them. They are bred to serve, as you breed animals to serve you. The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future.</p>
<p>集体由不同的种族组成，以及被培育为服务这些种族的存在组成。在这个世界上遇到的许多存在都是由集体培育出来的仆人。他们的遗传基因早已消失殆尽。他们被培育为服务者，就像你们培育动物来为你们服务一样。我们所倡导的人类合作是一种能够保留个人自决权的合作，并为人类提供一个强大的立足点，从这个立足点，人类不仅可以与集体互动，还可以与未来将造访你们世界的其他种族互动。</p>
<p>A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them.</p>
<p>集体基于一种信仰、一套原则和一个权威。它的重点是完全效忠于一个想法或理想。这不仅体现在你们来访者的教育中，也体现在他们的基因代码中。这就是他们行为方式的原因。这既是他们的力量，也是他们的弱点。他们在心理环境中具有强大的力量，因为他们的心灵是统一的。但他们的弱点在于他们不能独立思考。他们无法成功地处理复杂性或逆境。对他们来说，一个具有内识的男人或女人对他们来说是不可理解的。</p>
<p>Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them “collectives” because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world.</p>
<p>人类必须团结起来以保卫自己的自由，但这与建立一个集体是完全不同的。我们称他们为“集体”，因为他们是由不同种族和国家组成的集体。集体并不是一个种族。虽然在大社区中有许多种族被一个主导的权威所统治，但集体是一个跨越了一个种族对其自身世界忠诚的组织。</p>
<p>Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.</p>
<p>集体可以拥有强大的力量。然而，由于存在许多集体，他们往往会彼此竞争，这使得任何一个集体都无法成为主导。此外，大社区中的各个国家之间长期存在争端，这些争端很难弥合。也许他们长期以来在为相同的资源竞争。也许他们相互竞争以出售他们所拥有的资源。然而，一个集体是一个不同的存在。正如我们在这里所说，它不是基于一个种族和一个世界。这就是为什么你们的来访者是由不同种族的生命组成的，处于不同的权威和指挥层级。</p>
<hr>
<p>“In other worlds that have successfully unified, did they maintain their individual freedom of thought?”</p>
<p>“在成功实现统一的其他世界中，他们是否保持了个人思想自由？”</p>
<p>To varying degrees. Some to a very high degree, others less so, depending upon their history, their psychological make-up and the needs of their own survival. Your life in the world has been relatively easy compared to where other races have developed. Most places where intelligent life exists have been colonized, for there are not many terrestrial planets such as your own that provide such a wealth of biological resources. Their freedom, in large part, depended upon the wealth of their environments. But they have all been successful in thwarting alien infiltration and have established their own lines of trade, commerce and communication based upon their own self-determination. This is a rare accomplishment and must be earned and protected.</p>
<p>自由程度各不相同。有些世界在很大程度上保留了个人思想的自由，另一些则较少，这取决于他们的历史、心理构造以及自身生存的需要。与其他种族所发展的地方相比，你们在世界上的生活相对容易。大多数存在智能生命的地方都是被殖民的，因为像你们世界这样提供丰富生物资源的陆地行星并不多。他们的自由在很大程度上取决于他们环境的丰富性。但他们都成功地挫败了外星生命的渗透，并根据自身的自决权建立了自己的贸易、商业和通信线路。这是一个罕见的成就，必须通过努力获得并加以保护。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What will it take to achieve human unity?”</p>
<p>“实现人类团结需要什么？”</p>
<p>Humanity is very vulnerable in the Greater Community. This vulnerability, in time, can foster a fundamental cooperation amongst the human family, for you must join and unite in order to survive and to advance. This is part of having a Greater Community awareness. If this is based upon the principles of human contribution, freedom and self-expression, then your self-sufficiency can become very strong and very rich. But there must be greater cooperation in the world. People cannot live for themselves alone or put their own personal goals above and beyond the needs of everyone else. Some may view this as a loss of freedom. We see it as a guarantee for future freedom. For given the current attitudes prevalent in the world today, your future freedom would be very difficult to secure or maintain. Take heed. Those who are driven by their own selfishness are the perfect candidates for foreign influence and manipulation. If they are in positions of power, they will give over their nation’s wealth, their nation’s freedom and their nation’s resources in order to gain advantage for themselves.</p>
<p>在人类面临大社区时，显得非常脆弱。这种脆弱性，随着时间的推移，可以促使人类大家庭之间的基本合作，因为你们必须联合起来才能生存和进步。这是拥有大社区觉知的一部分。如果这种团结基于人类贡献、自由和自我表达的原则，那么你们的自给自足就会变得非常强大和丰富。但世界上必须有更大的合作。人们不能只为自己而活，也不能将自己的个人目标置于他人需求之上。一些人可能会将此视为自由的丧失。但我们将其视为对未来自由的一种保障。鉴于当今世界的普遍态度，你们未来的自由将很难得到保障或维持。请注意。那些被自己的自私心所驱使的人是外来影响和操纵的最佳人选。如果他们身居要职，他们将放弃国家的财富、国家的自由和国家的资源，以便为自己争取利益。</p>
<p>Therefore, greater cooperation is required. Surely you can see this. Surely this is apparent even within your own world. But this is very different from the life of the collective, where races have been dominated and controlled, where those who are compliant are brought into the collectives and those who are not are alienated or destroyed. Surely such an establishment, though it may have considerable influence, cannot be beneficial for its members. And yet this is the path that many in the Greater Community have taken. We do not wish to see humanity fall into such an organization. That would be a great tragedy and a loss.</p>
<p>因此，需要加强合作。当然，你们可以看到这一点。这在你们自己的世界中也是显而易见的。但这与集体生活有很大不同，在集体生活中，种族被支配和控制，顺从者被纳入集体，不顺从者被排斥或消灭。这样的组织，尽管可能拥有相当的影响力，但不可能对其成员有益。然而，这却是大社区中许多种族所走的道路。我们不希望看到人类陷入这样的组织中。那将是一个巨大的悲剧和损失。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How is the human perspective different from yours?”</p>
<p>“人类的视角与你们的有什么不同？”</p>
<p>One of the differences is that we have developed a Greater Community perspective, which is a less self-centered way of looking at the world. It is a point of view that gives great clarity and can provide great certainty regarding the smaller problems that you face in your daily affairs. If you can solve a great problem, you can solve lesser ones. You have a great problem. Every human being in the world faces this great problem. It can unite you and enable you to overcome your long-standing differences and conflicts. It is that great and that powerful. This is why we say there is a possibility for redemption within the very circumstances that threaten your well-being and your future.</p>
<p>其中一个区别是我们已经发展了大社区的视角，这是一种较少以自我为中心的看待世界的方式。这是一种可以带来极大清晰度的视角，并能为你们在日常事务中面临的较小问题提供巨大确定性。如果你能解决一个大的问题，你就能解决较小的问题。你面临一个巨大的问题。世界上的每个人都面临着这个巨大问题。它可以将你们团结起来，使你们能够克服长期存在的分歧和冲突。它是如此的伟大和强大。这就是为什么我们说在威胁你们福祉和未来的情况下，存在着救赎的可能性。</p>
<p>We know that the power of Knowledge within the individual can restore that individual and all of their relationships to a higher degree of accomplishment, recognition and ability. You must discover this for yourself.</p>
<p>我们知道，个人内心深处的内识力量可以使个人和他们的所有关系恢复到更高的成就、认知和能力水平。你必须为自己发现这一点。</p>
<p>Our lives are very different. One of the differences is that our lives are given to service, a service that we have chosen. We have the freedom to choose and thus our choice is real and meaningful and is based upon our own understanding. Amongst our group are representatives from several different worlds. We have come together in service to humanity. We represent a greater alliance that is more spiritual in nature.</p>
<p>我们的生活是非常不同的。其中一个区别就是我们的生活致力于服务，这是一种我们自己选择的服务。我们有选择的自由，因此我们的选择是真实而有意义的，并基于我们自己的理解。在我们的小组中，有来自几个不同世界的代表。我们聚集在一起，为人类服务。我们代表着一个在自然上更具精神的更伟大联盟。</p>
<hr>
<p>“This message is coming through one man. Why aren’t you contacting everybody if this is so important?”</p>
<p>“这个讯息是通过一个人传达的。如果这件事如此重要，你们为什么不联系所有人呢？”</p>
<p>It is merely a matter of efficiency. We do not control who is selected to receive us. That is a matter for the Unseen Ones, those whom you could rightly call “Angels.” We think of them in this way. They have selected this person, a person who has no position in the world, who is not recognized in the world, an individual who has been chosen because of his qualities and because of his heritage in the Greater Community. We are glad to have one through whom we can speak. If we spoke through more, they perhaps would disagree with one another, and the message would become confused and lost.</p>
<p>这仅仅是一个效率的问题。我们并不控制谁被选中接收我们的讯息。这是那些你们可以称之为“天使”的不可见者的事宜。我们也是这样看待他们的。他们选择了这个人，一个在世界上没有地位、不被世界认可的人。他之所以被选中，是因为他的品质和他在大社区中的传承。我们很高兴能够通过他传达我们的讯息。如果我们通过更多人来传达，他们可能会彼此产生分歧，讯息也会因此变得混乱和丢失。</p>
<p>We understand, from our own studenthood, that the transmission of spiritual wisdom is generally given through one, with the support of others. This individual must bear the weight and the burden and the risk of being so chosen. We respect him for doing this, and we understand what a burden it can be. This will be misconstrued, perhaps, and that is why the wise must remain hidden. We must remain hidden. He must remain hidden. In this way, the message can be given, and the messenger can be preserved. For there will be hostility towards this message. The visitors will oppose it and are opposing it already. Their opposition can be significant but will primarily be aimed at the messenger himself. It is for this reason that the messenger must be protected.</p>
<p>根据我们自身的学习经历，我们了解到，精神智慧的传递通常是通过一个人，并在他人的支持下完成的。这个人必须承受被选中的重量、负担和风险。我们尊重他所做的一切，也理解这可能带来的负担。这可能会被误解，这也是为什么智者必须保持隐匿。我们必须保持隐匿，他也必须保持隐匿。只有这样，讯息才能被传达，信使才能被保护。因为会有人对这个讯息产生敌意。来访者会反对它，并且已经在反对它。他们的反对可能会很显著，但主要是针对信使本人。正是因为这个原因，信使必须得到保护。</p>
<p>We know that the answers to these questions will generate more questions. And many of these cannot be answered, perhaps even for a long time. The wise anywhere must live with questions that they cannot yet answer. It is through their patience and their perseverance that real answers emerge and that they are able to experience them and embody them.</p>
<p>我们知道这些问题的答案会引发更多的问题。而其中许多问题是无法回答的，甚至可能在很长一段时间内都无法回答。智者无论在何处，都必须带着他们还不能回答的问题生活。正是通过他们的耐心和毅力，真正的答案会逐渐浮现，他们将能够体验，并体现这些答案。</p>
