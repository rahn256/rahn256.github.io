They will read it as if they think it is real and genuine, which it is, and they will become frightened and want to withdraw. They will want to deny it in some way.</p>
<p>许多人在阅读人类盟友的简报时，会感到害怕。他们会认为这些内容是真实且可信的——事实确实如此——因此他们会感到恐惧，并想要退缩。他们可能会以某种方式想要否认它。</p>
<p>In a way, The Allies of Humanity material reveals your weaknesses. It calls upon your strength. It calls upon your inherent wisdom. It calls upon Knowledge, the Spiritual Mind within you, but it also reveals your weaknesses. It reveals your vulnerability. It reveals your lack of control over your own consciousness. It reveals your undefended borders to space. It reveals your assumptions, your preoccupations, and overall your ignorance of life in the universe.</p>
<p>在某种程度上，《人类的盟友》材料揭示了你们的弱点。它呼唤你们的力量，呼唤你们固有的智慧，呼唤你们内心深处的精神心智——内识，但它也揭示了你们的弱点。它揭示了你们的脆弱性，揭示了你们对自己意识的缺乏控制，揭示了你们对太空毫无防备的边界，揭示了你们的假设、你们的心事，以及你们对宇宙生命的整体无知。</p>
<p>Here it is important to ask yourself if humanity will ever encounter intelligent life from beyond its world. And if it does, when that happens, how will humanity respond? How will humanity know if its new visitors are friendly or not? How will humanity be able to discern the visitors’ motives and their consciousness? How will humanity be able to discern their organization, their methods and so forth?</p>
<p>在这里，重要的是要问自己，人类是否会遇到来自其世界之外的智能生命。如果会，当它发生时，人类将如何应对？人类如何知道它新来的来访者是友善的还是敌对？人类如何辨别来者的动机和意识？人类将如何能够辨别他们的组织、他们的方法等等？</p>
<p>If you consider these questions seriously, you will realize that you have very few answers. And without answers, perhaps you will become afraid. You will feel your own vulnerability, and you will feel how unprepared people really are for an encounter such as this.</p>
<p>如果你认真考虑这些问题，你会意识到你们几乎没有答案。没有答案，你可能会感到害怕。你会感受到自己的脆弱，也会感受到人类在面对这样的遭遇时是多么缺乏准备。</p>
<p>Because most people still think that they are alone in the universe, that they have always been alone and will always be alone, well, this important set of questions really does not get considered by very many people. And even those who do consider it often think very romantically about life in the universe and what it will bring humanity and how much humanity will gain from this encounter. They think how interested the visitors will be in humanity’s art and culture, history and temperament.</p>
<p>因为大多数人仍然认为人类在宇宙中是孤独的，人类过去是孤立的，将来也会一直孤单，所以这些重要的问题并没有被许多人认真思考过。即使有些人考虑过，往往也是以浪漫的方式去想象宇宙中的生命，认为这将给人类带来多少益处，认为外来者会对人类的艺术、文化、历史和性情有多么大的兴趣。</p>
<p>So even amongst the very few people who really consider these questions and think they are important, there is often a great deal of romantic speculation. People are afraid to be realistic regarding life in the universe because it reveals their weaknesses. When we speak of weaknesses, we are not talking about your lack of technology. Really, what we are talking about is your lack of awareness, your lack of focus in life, your lack of social cohesion in your nations and cultures. Humanity is divided and contentious within itself. This makes you vulnerable to outside forces. But really your vulnerability goes even beyond this because it has to do with your state of mind. It has to do with your view of yourself and your world. It has to do with your assumptions, your illusions and your preoccupations.</p>
<p>因此，即使在那些真正考虑这些问题并认为它们重要的少数人中，通常也存在大量浪漫的猜测。人们害怕以现实的态度看待宇宙中的生命，因为这揭示了他们的弱点。当我们谈论弱点时，我们并不是指你们在技术上的不足。我们真正谈论的是你们缺乏觉知，缺乏对生命的专注，缺乏在国家和文化中的社会凝聚力。人类在内部是分裂和争斗的，这使你们容易受到外界力量的侵袭。但真正的脆弱性远不止于此，因为它与你们的心灵状态有关，与你们对自己的看法和对世界的看法有关。它与你们的假设、幻想和心事有关。</p>
<p>It is as if a great storm were building and had been building for some time, but people paid no attention. And then when the storm hits, well, it hits with such fury. It hits with such an impact. People are completely taken by surprise and are outraged and terrified. And yet the signs were there.</p>
<p>这就好比一场大风暴已经酝酿并积蓄了很长时间，但人们对此毫不在意。然后当暴风雨来临的时候，它以如此狂暴的方式袭来。带来巨大的冲击。人们会完全措手不及，充满惊恐和愤怒。然而，迹象早已存在。</p>
<p>Even human science is beginning now to acknowledge the preponderance of life in the universe as a theoretical probability. Yet who is concerned with what your first great encounters might mean?</p>
<p>甚至人类科学现在也开始承认宇宙中生命的大量存在是一种理论上的可能性。然而，谁会关心你们首次重大的遭遇可能意味着什么？</p>
<p>As The Allies Briefings are presented, there will be all kinds of denial, criticism and repudiation. Why? Why so much rejection over an encounter that everyone really considers to be very possible? Yet when it is actually accounted for, you will see a great deal of denial. “Outrageous! Ridiculous! Cannot happen!” You will hear scientists say, “Well, it is not possible for another race to get here given the limitations of travel and speed and so forth.” How presumptuous! Do human beings dare to presume what other nations and cultures have been able to develop over a long period of time? Is the universe limited by human understanding? Is it not possible that other races could have far surpassed human accomplishment in technology?</p>
<p>当人类盟友的简报被呈现时，将会有各种各样的否认、批评和驳斥的声音。为什么？为什么关于一个所有人都认为非常可能发生的接触会有如此多的拒绝？然而，当真正面对这个情况时，你会看到大量的否认。“荒唐！荒谬！不可能！”你会听到科学家们说：“嗯，鉴于旅行和速度等方面的限制，其他种族不可能到达这里。”多么自以为是啊！人类竟敢假设其他国家和文化在漫长的发展中能够达成什么成就？难道宇宙会受制于人类的理解吗？难道其他种族不可能在技术上远远超过人类的成就吗？</p>
<p>You may say, “Well, of course!” But when faced with the prospect of a real encounter, people sing a very different tune. Their idealism leaves them. Their romanticism is thrown into doubt. Their glorious anticipation is overshadowed with concern and anxiety.</p>
<p>你可能会说，“嗯，这是当然的！”但是，当面对真正的相遇的前景时，人们的态度会大不相同。他们的理想主义消失了，他们的浪漫幻想被受到质疑，光辉的期待被忧虑和焦虑所笼罩。</p>
<p>So when The Allies of Humanity message is presented, people begin to feel the real core of their fear, their lack of preparation, the weakness of their position. The Allies present a very realistic view of life in the universe. They are not here to answer every question that you may have, but instead to give you an awareness of what is really occurring in the world today and also to dispel much of the fanciful speculation that surrounds the prospect of humanity encountering other forms of intelligent life. Even fanciful expectation, hopeful expectation, really has fear at its core because you are uncertain, because you do not know, because you are unprepared, because you realize in a moment of honest recognition how vulnerable you really are, living on the surface of your world, exposed to the universe and undefended.</p>
<p>因此，当人类的盟友的讯息被呈现时，人们开始感受到他们恐惧的真正核心，感受到他们缺乏准备，感受到他们立场的脆弱。盟友们呈现了一个非常现实的宇宙生命观。他们在这里不是要回答你们可能有的每一个问题，而是给你们提供对当今世界上真正发生的事情的觉知，并打破关于人类与其他智能生命形式接触的众多幻想和猜测。即使是那些充满希望的期望，其核心也是恐惧，因为你们感到不确定，因为你们不知道，因为你们没有准备，因为你们在诚实的自我认知中意识到，你们其实是多么脆弱，生活在世界表面，暴露在宇宙中且毫无防备。</p>
<p>Think for a moment if you were another race visiting your world and you wanted to just simply observe human behavior. Just observe it, without interfering. Well, you could look down on everything. It is all there. Human activity, human involvements, human conflict, human relationships, human technology, human communication—it is all available to the discreet observer.</p>
<p>想象一下，如果你是另一个种族，来访地球，只是简单地观察人类行为。仅仅是观察，不进行干涉。你可以从上方俯视一切。人类的一切都在这里——人类的活动、人类的参与、人类的冲突、人类的关系、人类的技术、人类的交流——对于一个谨慎的观察者来说，一切都是可见的。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to understand why people are afraid. The fear of the reality of contact is deep-seated. Many people have this very glorified view that they are at the pinnacle of God’s creation, that their religions are built upon the pre-eminence of human spirituality and human identity. What will happen when they find out that humanity is one little race evolving within a Greater Community of intelligent life? And that this race is actually very weak, divided and insignificant in the vastness of the Creation!</p>
<p>因此，理解人们为什么会感到害怕是非常重要的。对接触现实的恐惧是根深蒂固的。许多人有一种非常荣耀的观念，认为自己处在上帝创造的顶峰，他们的宗教建立在人类的精神性和人类身份的卓越地位之上。当他们发现人类只是在智能生命的大社区中进化的一个小种族时，会发生什么？而且这个种族在浩瀚的创世中实际上是非常弱小、分裂和无足轻重的！人们的宗教观点无法容忍这种情况。</p>
<p>People’s religious views cannot tolerate this kind of realization. Many of these views are already being eroded by the discoveries of science that show that the universe does not revolve around this world, that this world is just a little planet revolving around an insignificant star in a vast galaxy amongst many. Where is human pre-eminence then? Who are you in the universe? Are you really important to anyone or anything?</p>
<p>人们的宗教观念往往无法容忍这样的认识。许多这样的观点已经被科学的发现所侵蚀，这些发现表明宇宙并不围绕这个世界运转，这个世界只是围绕一颗微不足道的恒星旋转的小行星，而这颗恒星位于一个庞大的银河系中。人类的卓越性在哪里呢？你们在宇宙中是谁？你们对任何生命或任何事真的重要吗？</p>
<p>We are asking these questions to bring you into the core of your anxiety because you must confront this within yourself. The inability or unwillingness to do this is really the source of all human ignorance and presumption regarding humanity’s place in the universe and regarding the reality of the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today.</p>
<p>我们提出这些问题是为了把你带入焦虑的核心，因为你必须面对自己内心深处的焦虑。没有能力或不愿意这样做，实际上是人类对自己在宇宙中的地位以及对当今世界正在发生的外星干预的现实的所有无知和推测的来源。</p>
<p>People say, “Well, there is no Intervention happening here. How ridiculous! It is all the fancy of certain people and their need for attention or their boredom or something.” What are you really hearing here but an excuse? This is the way that one pacifies oneself from experiencing real anxiety.</p>
<p>人们会说：“嗯，这里根本没有发生干预。多么荒谬！这只是某些人寻求关注、无聊或某种其他原因的幻想。”你真正听到的是什么？不过是借口罢了。这正是人们通过自我安慰来避免面对真正的焦虑的方式。</p>
<p>If you could consider this rationally and objectively, you would say, “Well, of course we would be visited at some point! I mean, if there is intelligent life in the universe, someone out there must know that we exist here.” And if you are not limited by the limitations of humanity’s science, that opens the door to many more possibilities.</p>
<p>如果你能够理性和客观地思考这个问题，你会说：“好吧，我们当然会在某个时候被访问！如果宇宙中有智能生命，那世界之外肯定有生命知道我们在这里的存在。”而如果你不被人类科学的局限性所限制，那就为更多的可能性打开了大门。</p>
<p>If you can ask these questions, you might think to yourself, “Yes, of course humanity will be encountered. Yes, our resources will be scrutinized. Yes, our world will be evaluated. Yes, there are other powers in the universe that would perhaps want our world to be part of their organization. And yes, they would want to take advantage of this beautiful place in some practical way.”</p>
<p>如果你能提出这些问题，你可能会对自己说：”是的，人类当然会被接触。是的，我们的资源会被仔细检查。是的，我们的世界会被评估。是的，宇宙中还有其他势力，也许会希望我们的世界成为他们组织的一部分。是的，他们会想以某种实际方式利用这个美丽的地方。”</p>
<p>You see, these observations are so obvious. These speculations, if you could call them that, are so reasonable, but people will not consider them. They will not face them because of their anxiety, because of their fear. In fact, the reality of life in the universe, the encounter with life in the universe and the Intervention itself together represent the most denied reality in the world today. People will think, “It is not important. I have my job. I have my family. I have, you know, my own daily problems. I mean, why should it matter to me?” What are you talking about? If there is an Intervention going on in the world, do you think that it is not relevant to you and to your life and to what will happen to you?</p>
<p>你看，这些观察是如此明显。这些推测，若你愿意称之为推测，是如此合乎情理，但人们却不愿意考虑它们。他们不愿面对它们，因为焦虑和恐惧。事实上，宇宙生命的现实，与宇宙生命的接触以及干预本身，代表了当今世界上最被否认的现实。人们会想：“这不重要。我有自己的工作，我有自己的家庭，我有自己的日常问题。这对我来说有何重要性呢？”你在说什么呢？如果世界上发生了干预，你认为它与你无关，与你的生活无关，以及你们将会发生的事情无关吗？</p>
<p>Do you see here? This is “isolationist thinking.” The Allies Briefings bring home the reality that humanity’s isolation is over! But the isolationist thinking continues, unabated. Unless you have a direct encounter with forces from the Greater Community where your life is disturbed or upset in some way, well, you will just continue on thinking the way you have always thought, living upon the assumptions that you have always lived upon, oblivious to the greater realities that are shaping your life and destiny. And how can God reach you to tell you to become alert and aware, to make you responsive to these greater realities that are changing your life and destiny?</p>
<p>你在这里看到了吗？这就是“孤立主义的思维”。人类盟友的简报带来了一个现实，那就是人类的孤立已经结束了！但孤立主义的思维依然持续，有增无减。除非你直接与大社区的力量接触，并且你的生活因此而受到干扰或打击，否则你将继续像以前一样思考，按照你一直以来的假设生活，忽视那些正在塑造你生命和天命的更大现实。而上帝又如何能触及你，告诉你要警觉并察觉到这个现实，并对这个正在改变你生命和天命的更大现实做出回应呢？</p>
<p>People love the idea of a God out there that will throw them a life preserver when they are drowning, but the idea that God will interfere in their life and show them something they really don’t want to see, well, that is really a test of faith, isn’t it? That is exactly what is happening today. That is why the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality is in the world because this is God’s message to alert humanity to this greater reality and to prepare humanity. The awareness is not enough. If the awareness engenders primary anxiety and fear, people will not know what to do. They will say, “Oh, my God! What do we do?” And they don’t know what to do because they have never had to respond to this directly before. That is why God’s message brings with it the preparation so people can begin to think like they live in a Greater Community. Then they can begin to become aware that there are Greater Community realities out there that are going to have a direct impact on them, their lives and their world.</p>
<p>人们喜欢上帝会在他们溺水的时候扔给他们一个救生圈的想法，但是，上帝会干预他们的生命，让他们看到一些他们真的不想看到的现实，嗯，这真的是对信仰的考验，不是吗？这正是今天正在发生的事情。这就是为什么大社区精神性中的教导会出现在这个世界上，因为这是上帝发送的讯息，提醒人类注意这个更大的现实，让人类做好准备。觉知是不够的。如果这种觉知引发了主要的焦虑和恐惧，人们就会不知道该做什么。他们会说：”哦，我的上帝！我们该怎么办？他们不知道该怎么做，因为他们从来没有直接应对过这种情况。这就是为什么上帝的讯息会带来准备工作，以便人们能够开始像生活在大社区中一样思考。然后，他们就能开始察觉，外面存在着将对他们、他们的生活和他们的世界产生直接影响的大社区现实。</p>
<p>The preparation must give you this greater awareness and consciousness, this sensitivity. Otherwise, you are like an ant colony in a field that is about to be plowed under. And the poor ant colony has not a clue of what is about to happen. Up until the moment of their destruction, well, life will be as it has always been.</p>
<p>准备工作必须让你拥有这种更大的觉知和意识，这种敏感性。否则，你就像一片即将被犁过的田野中的蚁群，而可怜的蚁群根本不知道即将发生什么。在它们毁灭的那一刻之前，生活仍然会像往常一样。</p>
<p>But you are not ants, and you have a consciousness. You can consider the future, and you can think about things that are beyond your visible range. And you can consider yourself living within a larger arena of life, both within the world and beyond the world within a Greater Community. As you develop this Greater Community awareness, you begin to see that your world is a very special place, with wonderful attributes. And you may think, “Well, of course others would be interested in our planet. And interested in us, not because we are magnificent but because we are the stewards of this place. We control this world.” And you would begin to think very, very objectively about your situation here.</p>
<p>但你不是蚂蚁，你拥有意识。你可以考虑未来，你可以思考那些超出你视线范围的事情。你可以考虑自己生活在一个更大的生命舞台上，既在这个世界的范围内，也在超越这个世界的大社区之中。当你发展这种大社区的觉知时，你开始看到你的世界是一个非常特殊的地方，具有令人惊叹的特质。你可能会想：“当然，其他种族会对我们的星球感兴趣。对我们感兴趣，不是因为我们的出色，而是因为我们是这个地方的管理者。我们掌控着这个世界。”然后，你会开始非常客观地思考自己在这里的处境。</p>
<p>However, even people who claim to be objective and scientific in their perspective are really still governed by this fundamental fear and anxiety and are still living under the general denial of the fact that the world is being visited and that the Intervention is occurring. They are in such a state of denial that they will not even consider it. They won’t come near it. The information, the evidence, is all over the place, but they won’t even come near it. They will just say, “Oh, no, no. That’s all foolishness. It’s just insecure people trying to get attention.”</p>
<p>然而，即使是那些声称自己的观点是客观和科学的人，实际上仍然被这种基本的恐惧和焦虑所支配，他们仍然生活在普遍否认世界正在被访问和干预正在发生的事实之下。他们处于这样一种否认状态，甚至不会考虑这个问题。他们不愿意接近它。信息，证据，到处都是，但他们根本不会接近它。他们只会说，”哦，不，不是的。这都是胡说八道。这只是没有安全感的人正在试图引起注意”。</p>
<p>They are in denial. They think they are being reasonable, but really they are being so unreasonable. They are supporting and fortifying their own ignorance and the ignorance of others. And even if they cannot accept that the Intervention is occurring, well, the prospect of life in the universe is still a very wondrous, romantic journey to them. It is like something that you dream about in the most glorious ways. “Oh, we will meet these advanced races who will give us so much technology and enlighten us on how to live in peace and so forth.” This is all foolishness! They have not a clue what is happening out there in the universe.</p>
<p>他们处于否认之中。他们认为自己是合理的，但实际上他们是如此无理。他们在支持并强化自己的无知以及他人的无知。即使他们无法接受干预正在发生的事实，好吧，宇宙中存在生命的前景对他们来说依然是一次充满奇妙和浪漫的旅程。这就像你在梦中以最荣耀的方式幻想的事情。“哦，我们将遇到那些先进的种族，他们会给我们带来许多技术，并启发我们如何和平地生活等等。”这都是愚蠢之举！他们对宇宙中发生的事情一无所知。</p>
<p>If these reasonable people are given a Greater Community perspective, which the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality provides, oh, my God! It touches that core fear and anxiety. And they feel in that moment how utterly vulnerable they are, how undefended they are, how unprepared they are. And you look at people, and they don’t have a clue. And they don’t want to have a clue. And you look at your world, and you say, “Oh, my God! We could be overtaken without our even knowing it!”</p>
<p>如果给这些通情达理的人一个大社区的视角，而这种视角正是大社区精神性教学所提供的，哦，我的上帝！它触及了核心的恐惧和焦虑。在那一刻，他们感受到自己是多么脆弱，多么没有防备，多么缺乏准备。而你看着人们，他们没有任何线索。他们也不希望有任何线索。你看着你们的世界，你会说，”哦，我的上帝！我们可能在不知不觉中被取代了！”</p>
<p>If you did not have the preparation in Greater Community Spirituality, if you did not have anywhere to go with this awareness, it could be overwhelming because you would think that you had no recourse. It is as if humanity, like an unsuspecting native tribe, were just waiting to be taken over by someone else.</p>
<p>如果你没有在大社区精神性方面的准备，如果你没有带着这种觉知去任何地方，它可能是压倒性的，因为你会认为自己无计可施。这就像人类，像一个毫无防备的原住民部落，只是等待着被其他种族接管。</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is the problem with the assumption that technology equals salvation. This is becoming a modern religion in many cultures in the world. Developed nations increasingly believe that technology really is their salvation now. There is a problem? Well, technology will solve it. There is something we can’t understand? Well, technology will overcome it. There is a situation that could arise for which we are unprepared? Well, technology will meet the challenge. “We will meet the challenge with our technology in the eleventh hour.” There is a sort of unquestioned belief that technology is going to save you, regardless of what might happen—technology mixed with human ingenuity, that is. And no matter how overwhelming a situation might be, well, ingenuity plus technology will win the day in the final moments.</p>
<p>当然，还有一个问题，就是假设技术等于救赎。这在许多文化中正在成为一种现代宗教。发达国家越来越相信，技术现在确实是他们的救赎。有一个问题？好吧，技术会解决它。有一些我们无法理解的事情？好吧，技术会克服它。会出现我们没有准备好的情况吗？好吧，技术会迎接挑战。“我们将在关键时刻用我们的技术应对挑战。”人们有一种毋庸置疑的信念，认为技术会拯救他们，无论发生什么——这就是技术与人类创造力的结合。无论情况多么压倒性，创造力加上技术最终会战胜一切。</p>
<p>Can you see that this is all part of the denial? Wishful thinking is what it is. Regarding the Greater Community, it really is wishful thinking. Do you think humanity is going to generate a technological answer to the presence of Greater Community forces who may want your planet for themselves? We can assure you that it will not be at the level of technology that you will be able to counteract this presence and these influences. Facing a race that is perhaps a thousand years ahead of you technologically, do you think you are going to make a difference in the next few years?</p>
<p>你能看到这也是否认的一部分吗？这其实是一种一厢情愿的想法。就大社区而言，这确实是一厢情愿的想法。你认为人类能够产生一种技术性的解决方案，来应对那些可能想要夺取你们星球的大社区力量的存在吗？我们可以向你保证，技术层面不会是你们能够抵御这种存在及其影响的办法。面对一个在技术上可能领先你们一千年的种族，你认为你们会在未来几年内有所作为吗？</p>
<p>Consider this: The answer will not happen at the level of technology. It will happen at the level of the mind and consciousness. Those who are intervening in the world today are very concerned about preserving the world’s resources and about preserving the human presence here as a workforce. They cannot use technology to accomplish this alone. Yes, their technology is useful in neutralizing someone they may want to take for themselves for investigation. However, if they forcefully exert their technology on your world, they will destroy the world’s resources and destroy the human presence here, and they cannot do that. Therefore, they must use the very means that you are able to counteract.</p>
<p>考虑一下这个问题：答案不会发生在技术层面上。它将发生在心灵和意识的层面。那些干预当今世界的集体非常关注保护世界的资源和保持这里的人类存在作为劳动力。他们不能仅靠技术来完成这个任务。是的，他们的技术在中和他们可能想据为己有的人进行调查方面是有用的。然而，如果他们在你们的世界上强行施展他们的技术，他们将破坏世界的资源，摧毁这里的人类存在，他们不能这样做。因此，他们必须使用你们能够反制的手段。</p>
<p>Yet here we run into fear again because people realize that without their technology, without the hope and the belief that technology is going to win the day and without human intellect being able to solve the problem, they are back in this very vulnerable place once again. But we are not talking about the intellect here. It is not at the level of the intellect that humanity is going to be able to counteract this presence and to strengthen itself in the Greater Community. The intellect plays a very important role as far as technology goes and in certain kinds of problem solving. But in this situation, it will take a deeper awareness.</p>
<p>然而，在这里我们再次遇到了恐惧，因为人们意识到，如果没有他们的技术，没有对技术能够解决问题的希望和信念，以及人类智力的介入，他们又回到了一个非常脆弱的境地。但是，我们并不是在谈论智力。在这个层面上，人类将无法反制这种存在，也无法在大社区中加强自身的力量。智力在技术方面以及某些问题的解决中确实发挥着重要作用。但在这种情况下，它需要更深层次的觉知。</p>
<p>After all, some of your most intellectually brilliant people are in total denial of the Intervention and think life in the universe is some distant possibility. And you ask yourself, “Well, if they are so brilliant and so well informed, why can’t they feel this presence in the world today? Why can’t they even face this as a possibility and study the evidence rather than dismissing it out of hand? If people are so smart, how can they be so stupid?” Ignorance is one thing. Ignorance can be compensated by gaining information and perspective. But this is not merely ignorance. This is arrogance. It is the assumption that you know what life is in the universe. Oh, my God! Humanity knows what life is in the universe? Oh, my God! Humanity is so far from knowing what life is in the universe, it is pathetic!</p>
<p>毕竟，你们中一些最有智力的聪明人完全否认干预，并认为宇宙中的生命是一个遥远的可能性。你会问自己：“好吧，如果他们如此聪明、如此见多识广，为什么他们不能感受到今天世界上的这种存在？为什么他们甚至不能把这当作一种可能性来面对，研究证据，而不是断然否定它？如果人们如此聪明，他们怎么会如此愚蠢呢？”无知是一回事。无知可以通过获得信息和视角来弥补。但这不仅仅是无知。这是傲慢。这是一种假设，即你知道宇宙中的生命是什么样子。哦，我的上帝！人类知道宇宙中的生命是什么样子？哦，我的上帝！人类距离知道宇宙中的生命还差得远，这简直是可悲的！</p>
<p>Given the unfounded belief in technology as the source of human salvation, many people think, well, more technology is more salvation. And they think that technologically advanced races have evolved beyond being self-seeking and contentious and devious. They think that technologically advanced races do not have conflict and that these races have outgrown the chronic problems that humanity still faces. What a ridiculous assumption! You have technology today that your forefathers a hundred years ago could not even imagine. And yet have you overcome these problems yourselves?</p>
<p>鉴于人们对技术作为人类救赎来源的无根据信念，许多人认为，更多的技术就是更多的救赎。他们认为，技术先进的种族已经进化到了超越唯利是图、争斗和狡诈的地步。他们认为，这些技术先进的种族没有冲突，这些种族已经摆脱了人类仍然面临的慢性问题。多么荒谬的假设！你们今天拥有的技术是你们的祖辈一百年前根本无法想象的。然而，你们是否已经克服了这些问题？</p>
<p>Therefore, do not look to the experts to give you the answer. You must find the answer yourself because the experts may not know and may not want to know. Remember, they are human beings just like you and they have their own thresholds of fear and anxiety that they may not be willing to face.</p>
<p>因此，不要指望专家给你答案。你必须自己寻找答案，因为专家们可能不知道，甚至不想知道。记住，他们和你一样都是人，他们也有自己的恐惧和焦虑的阈值，他们可能不愿意面对这些门槛。</p>
<p>In a way, the Intervention is the most challenging thing that could happen to humanity. Part of humanity’s liability or weakness here is its presumption that it really understands life, that it really knows what is happening in the universe, that it understands who can travel, who cannot travel and how long it takes to get to planets. It assumes that human understanding sets the standard for all understanding in the universe. This is human arrogance, which supports and fortifies human ignorance.</p>
<p>在某种程度上，干预对人类来说是最具挑战性的事情。人类在这方面的责任或弱点之一就是自以为真的理解生命，认为自己真的知道宇宙中发生了什么，它理解谁能旅行、谁不能旅行，以及到达行星需要多久时间。它假设人类的理解为宇宙中的所有理解设定了标准。这是人类的傲慢，它支持并强化了人类的无知。</p>
<p>It is presented in the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, and it is presented very boldly in the message from The Allies of Humanity, that life in the universe is challenging, difficult and competitive. And if you approach life in the universe romantically or if you deny it altogether, you do this at great risk.</p>
<p>在大社区精神性的教学中，这一点得到了非常明确的阐述，来自人类的盟友的讯息也明确指出，宇宙中的生命是具有挑战性的、困难和竞争性的。如果你浪漫地对待宇宙中的生命，或者完全否认它，这将面临巨大的风险。</p>
<p>What really needs to happen here is a whole new shift in human awareness and human learning. It is as if you have reached this great threshold and there must be a completely new paradigm of understanding. It is not simply that you are building on past understanding, adding another feature or another dimension to human awareness. It is really that you have to make kind of a leap here. This is because human understanding is still so grounded in an anthropocentric view of the universe, with humanity at the center of everything and the unquestioned belief that life in the universe functions according to human values and ideals.</p>
<p>这里真正需要发生的是人类觉知和人类学习的全新转变。就好像你们已经达到了这个伟大的门槛，必须有一个全新的理解范式。它并不仅仅是你在过去的理解基础上进行的构建，为人类的觉知增加另一个特征或另一个维度。实际上，你必须在这里做出一种飞跃。这是因为人类的理解仍然深深扎根于以人类为中心的宇宙观中，人类被视为一切的中心，并且毫无疑问地相信宇宙中的生命是按照人类的价值观和理想运作的。</p>
<p>For many people, there is still this idea that God is primarily concerned with humanity as the centerpiece of Creation and that everything else is just sort of wallpaper to this great human drama. Look at your religions. Are they really equipped to deal with the realities of the Greater Community? Let me give you this analogy: There are native tribes that have been overtaken and cultures that have been assimilated and destroyed countless places in your world in the last 500 years. It is still occurring today. They have their religions, which can be very expansive. But their religions usually do not include the reality of human life beyond their borders, which puts them in a very vulnerable position because they really don’t know how to respond in the face of an Intervention.</p>
<p>对于许多人来说，仍然存在这样的想法：上帝主要关注人类，视其为创造的中心，而其他一切则只是这个伟大人类剧幕的背景。看看你们的宗教。它们真的有能力应对大社区的现实吗？让我给你打个比方：在过去的500年里，许多地方的原住民族被征服，文化被同化和摧毁。今天，这种情况仍在发生。他们有自己的宗教，这些宗教可能非常广泛。但是，他们的宗教通常不包括他们边界以外的人类生命的现实，这使他们处于非常脆弱的位置，因为他们真的不知道在面对干预时该如何应对。</p>
<p>Compared to the Greater Community, humanity’s outpost in this world is like a little village in the jungle. And when this village is confronted with forces coming to seek advantages, what can it do? Well, interestingly enough, it can actually do a great deal. The first thing is to become aware of the Intervention and to face your own fear and anxiety. Here it is necessary to see how ill prepared you are, how vulnerable you are and how easily even you could be persuaded to think and to believe that the visitors are here for your benefit. This is the first threshold, a threshold which unfortunately many people will not cross. They will withdraw or go into denial or cast a very preferred perspective over the whole matter. The first threshold is to recognize your situation. Even if the Intervention were not occurring at this time, you know it would occur at some time.</p>
<p>与大社区相比，人类在这个世界的前哨基地就像丛林中的一个小村庄。当这个村庄面临寻求利益的势力时，它能做些什么呢？有趣的是，它实际上可以做很多事情。第一步是察觉到干预，面对自己的恐惧和焦虑。在这里，有必要看看你们的准备有多么不充分，有多么脆弱，以及你们是多么容易被说服去相信来访者是为了你们的利益而来。这是第一个门槛，不幸的是，许多人不会跨越这个门槛。他们会退缩或进入否认状态，或者给整个事情套上一个非常理想化的视角。第一个门槛是认识到你们的处境。即使干预没有在这个时候发生，你也会知道它将在某个时间发生。</p>
<p>You see, it’s interesting. People have their grand notions of intelligent life in the universe and advanced technology and other races of altruistic beings out there floating around. Yet the thing that people are most afraid of is that they will encounter others like themselves, but more powerful. What is the thing that people are really afraid of regarding the prospect of encountering intelligent life from beyond the world? They are afraid they will meet themselves. In a different form, perhaps. Perhaps the visitors will look different and use a different language and a different means of communication. But the thing that people are really afraid of, the thing that no one can even talk about, particularly in enlightened circles, is the reality that they are going to meet themselves.</p>
<p>你看，这很有趣。人们对宇宙中智能生命的伟大设想，对先进技术以及其他无私种族的存在充满了想象。然而，人们最害怕的事情是他们会遇到像自己一样的人，但更强大。关于遇到来自世界之外的智能生命的前景，人们真正害怕的是什么呢？他们害怕遇见的是自己。也许是以一种不同的形式，也许来访者会看起来不同，使用不同的语言和不同的交流方式。但是，人们真正害怕的、甚至没有人能够谈论的，尤其是在开明的圈子里，就是他们将要遇到的现实。</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that your visitors are human beings or that intelligent life functions according to human ideals and beliefs. What we are really telling you here, and what you must come to terms with, is that you are going to meet beings who are driven by the same needs that you are driven by.</p>
<p>这并不是说你们的来访者是人类，也不是说智能生命是按照人类的理想和信仰来运作的。我们真正想要告诉你，也希望你能够接受的是，你们将会遇到那些同样受到人类需求驱动的生命。</p>
<p>The Greater Community of life in which you live is a very competitive environment. You can see this competition in your own world. You can see it in the natural world. You can see it at the level of plants and animals. Yet the Greater Community is a competitive environment on a scale you cannot even comprehend. This means that everyone who is in that environment, particularly those who are active participants in trade and commerce, must find resources and gain alliances with other nations and often try to persuade those nations to enter into alliances with them.</p>
<p>你们所生活的大社区是一个竞争激烈的环境。你可以在你自己的世界中看到这种竞争。你可以在自然界中看到它。你可以在植物和动物的层面上看到它。然而，大社区的竞争环境之激烈，是你们根本无法理解的。这意味着，身处这种环境中的每个种族，尤其是那些积极从事贸易和商业活动的集体，都必须寻找资源，与其他国家结盟，并经常试图说服这些国家与自己结盟。</p>
<p>The need for resources does not end because of technology. Technology does not end the fundamental needs of life. It hasn’t for you and it hasn’t for anyone in the universe. Yes, it frees you from certain basic activities, but it creates more complexity. You may not need to go out and hunt and fish for your food, or farm, but you must go to work. You must maintain a much more complicated life in order to afford the food that you need to eat. Technology has freed you from hunting and gathering and has freed you from basic agriculture, but it has not freed you from the need for resources. Indeed, it has made your life more complicated and more exciting, but in other ways, more difficult and more stressful.</p>
<p>对资源的需求并不会因为技术而消失。技术并没有结束生命的基本需求。对你们而言没有，对宇宙中的任何生命而言也没有。是的，技术把你们从某些基本活动中解放出来，但它也带来了更多的复杂性。你们可能不再需要出去狩猎、捕鱼或务农，但你们必须去工作。为了负担你们需要的食物，你们必须维持一种更加复杂的生活。技术解放了你们免于狩猎和采集，并使你们从基本农业中解放出来，但它并没有解放你们对资源的需求。事实上，它使你们的生活变得更加复杂、更加精彩，但在其他方面，也更加困难、压力更大。</p>
<p>It is the same with life in the universe. Everyone has to eat. Everyone has to maintain what they have created. Everyone must deal with other forms of intelligent life that may be vying or competing for basic resources. Do you think an advanced nation in the universe does not have a great need for resources?</p>
<p>宇宙中的生命也是如此。每个生命都需要吃饭。每个种族都必须维持他们所创造的一切。每个种族都必须处理其他可能争夺或竞争基本资源的智能生命。你认为宇宙中的先进国家没有对资源的强烈需求吗？</p>
<p>The larger nations or organizations may become, the more restrictive they will be regarding personal freedom for their constituents, and the greater the need will be for order and conformity. That is why in the universe the really free nations are small and isolated. Their technology has given them advantages, but they must protect it and keep it hidden.</p>
<p>国家或组织越大，它们对公民的个人自由的限制就越多，对秩序和一致性的需求就越强。这就是为什么在宇宙中，真正自由的国家往往是小而孤立的。他们的技术为他们带来了优势，但他们必须保护和隐藏这些优势。</p>
<p>It would be like you getting a million dollars and going out into the marketplace with your million dollars. Well, what a rude shock. Now everyone is your friend. Now everyone wants to invite you to invest in their endeavor, in their project, or they need your financial help because they are in difficulty. If humanity were ever able to travel beyond its borders and carry its great incentive and enterprise into the universe, it would be like the little housewife having a million dollars and going out into the marketplace. You would not last very long.</p>
<p>这就像你拥有了一百万美元，走进市场。哇，真是个惊吓。现在每个人都是你的朋友。现在每个人都想邀请你投资他们的事业，或因为遇到困难而需要你的财务帮助。如果人类能够来到自己的边界之外，将其伟大的激励和事业带入宇宙，这就像一个小主妇拿着一百万美元走进市场。你不会坚持太久。</p>
<p>You see, this reality of life, which is so denied, is something that must be faced. Who will you meet in the universe? You will meet others like you. Not exactly like you. Not looking like you or talking like you or dressing like you. But they are like you in their needs. And those who are resource explorers in the universe are not the spiritually enlightened.</p>
<p>你看，这种被否认的生命现实必须面对。你们会在宇宙中遇见谁？你们将遇见与你们相似的其他存在。并不是完全相同。不会看起来像你们，或者说着与你们相同的语言，穿着与你们相同的服装。但他们在需求上与你们相似。而那些在宇宙中作为资源勘探者的集体并不是精神上的开明者。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to counteract many of the prevailing assumptions and beliefs, fantasies and myths, because otherwise you cannot face the situation. And if you cannot face the situation, it will overtake you. People pray to God for guidance, for strength, for courage and for peace, and God sends Greater Community Spirituality as a preparation. And people say, “What is this? I did not ask for this! What will I do with this? It isn’t relevant!” You don’t know what’s relevant. What you think is relevant may be important to you personally, but it’s not going to protect your rights and your freedoms in the future.</p>
<p>因此，有必要抵制许多流行的假设和信念、幻想和神话，否则你将无法面对这种情况。而如果你不能面对这种情况，它就会压倒你。人们向上帝祈求指引，祈求力量，祈求勇气与和平，而上帝则发送了大社区精神性作为准备。而人们却说：”这是什么？我并没有要求这个!我将用这个做什么？它并不相关！”你不知道什么是相关的。你认为相关的事情可能对你个人很重要，但它不会在未来保护你们的权利和自由。</p>
<p>Humanity’s encounter with intelligent life in the universe is not the product of human journeys into space or human science or human philosophy or human religion. It is the result of the Intervention. It is the result of other races coming here in order to preserve the world for themselves, believing that humanity will destroy the world in its conflicts, that humanity will ruin the world’s valuable resources.</p>
<p>人类与宇宙中智能生命的相遇，并不是人类太空旅行或人类科学或人类哲学或人类宗教的产物。它是干预的结果。它是其他种族为了保护这个世界而来到这里，他们相信人类会在冲突中摧毁这个世界，相信人类会毁掉这个世界的宝贵资源。</p>
<p>Think about this. This is how people would react. If, let us say, developed nations in the world found some little tribe in the recesses of the jungles who were sitting on tons of gold or other kinds of minerals, or had vast forests full of valuable woods, do you think that the advanced nations would not intervene, particularly if they felt these resources were going to waste? Or how about if the natives were cutting down all the trees because they liked the sunlight or they wanted to grow their own food? Well, the nations of the world would be in there doing everything they could to get the resources, either legally or illegally. That is what human nations would do. Do you think they would sit by and let the natives just despoil or neglect what they have? Of course not. Well, if the land is of no value to the powerful nations, sure, give them their reservation. But if they are sitting on $100 million in gold, that would not be a reservation.</p>
<p>考虑一下这个问题。这就是人们会有的反应。比方说，如果世界上的发达国家在丛林深处发现了一些小部落，他们坐拥成吨的黄金或其他种类的矿物，或者有大片的森林，充满了有价值的木材，你认为先进国家不会进行干预吗？特别是如果他们觉得这些资源正在被浪费？或者，如果原住民因为喜欢阳光或想种植自己的食物而砍伐所有的树木呢？那时，世界各国将在这里尽其所能地获取资源，无论是合法的还是非法的。这就是人类国家会做的事情。你认为他们会坐视不管，让原住民掠夺或忽视他们所拥有的资源吗？当然不会。如果土地对强大的国家毫无价值，那倒是可以保留给他们。但如果他们拥有1亿美元的黄金，那就不只是保留土地的问题了。</p>
<p>Your world is viewed like that by your visitors and by others in the universe who see this precious little world and this race of relatively destructive beings destroying its natural resources and violating its natural laws. Do you think this would not produce an Intervention? Some people think, “Well, of course, they would come and ask permission to be here and our nations, our governments would work out a deal.” Oh, my God! Are you kidding? What would happen instead is that those intervening races would establish a plan of intervention and integration because they want to preserve the human workforce. They cannot live in your world. They will have you do all the work. Get the natives to mine the gold. Just like what has happened in your world. Do you think the natives’ permission is needed? Well, maybe they will find a way to induce you to give your permission, but they are going to get what they want. In your situation in the world today, your visitors are going to get what they want unless you stop them. And the way you are going to stop them is not merely by using technology. It is by intelligence and by cunning. And by cooperation in the human family.</p>
<p>你们的世界在你们的来访者和宇宙中的其他生命眼中被视为这样一个珍贵的小世界，而这个相对具有破坏性的种族正在破坏自然资源，违反自然法则。你认为这不会导致干预吗？有些人会想：“当然，他们会来这里请求许可，我们的国家、政府会达成协议。”哦，我的上帝！你在开玩笑吗？取而代之的情况是，那些介入的种族会制定一个干预和整合计划，因为他们想要保护人类的劳动力。他们无法生活在你们的世界里，只能让你们来做所有的工作。让原住民去开采黄金。就像在你们的世界里所发生的一样。你认为需要得到原住民的许可吗？好吧，也许他们会想办法诱使你们给予许可，但他们会得到他们想要的。在你们如今的世界中，来访者会得到他们想要的资源，除非你们阻止他们。而你们阻止他们的方法不仅仅是使用技术。它是通过智能和机智，以及人类家庭之间的合作。</p>
<p>The first step in counteracting the Intervention is awareness, but the awareness really is a big threshold because of people’s fear, anxiety and failed idealism. Can you face your own fear? Can you face your own vulnerability? Can you face the fact that perhaps you have been really wrong in your assessment of the situation, if you have given it any thought at all? People may say, “Well, ok, we get the awareness. Now what’s the next thing?” Ha! They don’t see that the awareness is really big!</p>
<p>抵制干预的第一步是觉知，但由于人们的恐惧、焦虑和失败的理想主义，觉知真的是一个很大的门槛。你能面对自己的恐惧吗？你能面对自己的脆弱吗？你能面对这样一个事实，即或许你在对形势的评估上真的错得离谱，如果你曾考虑过这一点的话？人们可能会说，“好吧，我们有了觉知。接下来该做什么？”哈！他们没有看到，觉知真的很重要!</p>
<p>The next step is you have to create a Greater Community perspective in the way you look at yourself and in the way that you look at your world. Do you think humanity would be destroying the resources of the world if it could recognize that preserving and sustaining these resources is the very thing that will preserve human freedom in the future? If humanity loses its ability to sustain itself and becomes dependent upon foreign powers for not just advanced technology but for even basic resources, you will lose your freedom.</p>
<p>下一步是你需要在看待自己和世界的方式中，创造一种大社区的视角。如果人类能够认识到保护和维持这些资源是未来维护人类自由的关键，你认为人类还会破坏世界的资源吗？如果人类失去了自我维持的能力，不仅在先进技术方面，甚至在基本资源方面都要依赖外来势力，那你们就会失去自己的自由。</p>
<p>Perhaps you may say, “Oh, I don’t believe it. We wouldn’t lose our freedom.” But if you think about it objectively, you will see that you will lose your freedom. Either overtly or subtly, you would become reliant upon other races in the universe, and they would determine the terms of engagement. They would control your world. Yet because they do not want to create a human revolution, they will attempt to control your world in such a way that it would be acceptable to people to be controlled. That is why the Intervention that is occurring today is so devious and is being carried out so carefully over time. If they came here in force, everyone would just react and there would be huge warfare and the world’s resources would be severely damaged. There would be no human workforce here that would be either willing or able to help the intervening races, and the whole project would be spoiled.</p>
<p>也许你会说，“哦，我不相信。我们不会失去自己的自由。”但如果你客观地考虑这个问题，你会发现，你们将失去自由。无论是明显还是微妙，你们都会依赖宇宙中的其他种族，他们会决定互动的条款。他们会控制你们的世界。然而，因为他们不想创造一场人类革命，他们将试图以一种人们可以接受的方式来控制你们的世界，让你们被控制。这就是为什么今天发生的干预行动是如此狡诈，并且随着时间的推移如此小心翼翼地进行。如果他们强行来到这里，每个人都会做出反应，结果将是巨大的战争，世界的资源将受到严重的破坏。到那时，将没有愿意或能够帮助干预种族的人类劳动力，整个项目就会毁于一旦。</p>
<p>You must gain a Greater Community perspective. You are a human being living in this world. This world is unprotected. It is valuable. It is sought by others. Intervention by other races will increase over time. How will you defend your borders? How will you be able to determine who is here and why they are here and what they are doing? This cannot be the privilege of secret groups and secret governments.</p>
<p>你必须获得一种大社区的视角。你是一个生活在这个世界上的人类。这个世界是不受保护的。它是有价值的。它被其他种族所寻求。在未来，其他种族的干预将会随着时间的推移而增加。你们将如何捍卫自己的边界？你们将如何确定谁在这里，他们为什么在这里，他们在做什么？这不能是秘密团体和秘密政府的特权。</p>
<p>Humanity has to grow up and outgrow its childish self-preoccupations. It has to outgrow its adolescent fantasies about itself and about life and become realistic. Otherwise, the Intervention will continue, and your world will gradually become governed by foreign powers. And where will you go then with your complaints, your protest and your outrage? It is for this reason that gaining the awareness and a Greater Community perspective is critical because without these, you cannot even take the next step.</p>
<p>人类必须成熟，摆脱其幼稚的自我关注。它必须摆脱对自己以及生命的青春期幻想，变得现实起来。否则，干预将继续下去，你们的世界将逐渐被外来势力所统治。到那时，你们的抱怨、抗议和愤怒又将去往何处？正因为如此，获得觉知和大社区的视角是至关重要的，因为没有这些，你们甚至无法迈出下一步。</p>
<p>The third step is learning about the mental environment. The mental environment is the arena of influence. People know very little about it, but it is very important in Greater Community interactions, particularly between races or organizations that compete with each other. They have to spend a great deal of time trying to discern what the other is going to do and trying to influence the other in subtle ways. This does not happen through technology as much as it happens through consciousness, through awareness, through the projection of thought and through cunning activities. Competitors generally share the same technology, so technology is not the advantage. The advantage is cunning and persuasion. You cannot see this yet because you are still thinking like you live in isolation and that the universe is governed by human principles. You do not want to think about this because you realize that you do not have these skills. And that makes you feel afraid and vulnerable. So the third step in preparation is developing skill in the mental environment. You can actually learn how to do this, but you must have the awareness and you must have a Greater Community perspective to start.</p>
<p>第三步是学习心理环境。心理环境是影响的领域。人们对它知之甚少，但它在大社区的互动中非常重要，特别是在相互竞争的种族或组织之间。他们需要花费大量时间试图推测对方的动向，并试图以微妙的方式影响对方。这并不是通过技术实现的，而是通过意识，通过觉知，通过思想的投射以及狡诈的活动来实现的。竞争者通常共享相同的技术，因此技术并不是优势。优势在于狡诈和说服力。你们还看不到这一点，因为你们仍然认为自己生活在孤立的环境中，宇宙是由人类原则所支配的。你们不愿意思考这个问题，因为你们意识到自己没有这些技能。这让你们感到害怕和脆弱。因此，准备的第三步是培养在心理环境中的技能。你实际上可以学习如何做到这一点，但你必须具备觉知，并且必须拥有大社区的视角作为起点。</p>
<p>The fourth thing which really must be developed all along is Knowledge. What is Knowledge? When we speak of Knowledge, we are not talking about perspective or bodies of information or data. We are talking about the ability to know—beyond deception, beyond appearances, beyond personal preference, beyond fear and beyond denial. The ability to know. The Intervention has been going on actively for almost 50 years. And people who claim to be studying the UFO phenomenon, well, do they know anything yet, or are they still gathering data? “Well, we don’t want to come to any premature conclusions. You know, this is so complicated and we may never understand it!” What are you talking about? Is this denial? Is this the unwillingness to come to a conclusion? Or is it that people simply just don’t know? Can’t they see and feel what this really is? After 50 years, can’t they see and feel what this really is? They need more evidence? Oh, my God! How much more evidence? Another 50 years of evidence? A hundred years of evidence? 50 more years of evidence, and it will be all over then. And the conclusion you will come to will be so obvious.</p>
<p>第四件事是内识，真正必须一直发展的内识。什么是内识？当我们谈论内识时，我们不是在谈论观点或信息库或数据。我们在谈论的是超越欺骗、外表、个人偏好、恐惧和否认的能力。知道的能力。干预已经积极进行了近50年。而那些声称在研究UFO现象的人，好吧，他们知道什么了吗，他们还在收集数据？“好吧，我们不想得出任何过早的结论。你知道的，这是很复杂的，我们可能永远无法理解！”你在说什么呢？这是否认吗？这是不愿意得出结论吗？还是人们根本不想知道？难道他们看不到并感受到这究竟是什么吗？经过50年，他们难道还看不到并感受到这是什么吗？他们需要更多证据？哦，我的上帝！还需要多少证据？再来50年的证据？一百年的证据？再来50年的证据，到那时一切都会结束。而你得出的结论将是如此明显。</p>
<p>It is like the person in a 30-year marriage who never should have gotten married anyway, and it takes them 30 years to figure out that really they made a mistake somewhere back there, and they really should have followed their deeper feelings and not walked down the aisle with this other person. But they have been trying to make it all right for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>它就像一个在婚姻中待了30年的人，他们根本就不应该结婚，他们花了30年的时间才发现自己真的在某个地方犯了一个错误，他们真的应该遵循自己内心深处的感受，而不是和这个人走入婚姻的殿堂。但他们这30年来一直在努力让这一切变得正确。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will only know what others want you to know. You will only think what others want you to think—whether it be your parents, your culture, your social group, your government, or the Greater Community. You will basically be like cattle and you will be led around, from pasture to pasture. Without Knowledge, the mental environment overtakes you and overwhelms you. Knowledge is the deeper Spiritual Mind within you. It is the only part of you that is unaffected by the mental environment. It is the only part of you that is free from deception and manipulation.</p>
<p>没有内识，你只会知道别人想让你知道的事情。你只会想别人想让你想的事情——无论是你的父母、你的文化、你的社交团体、你的政府，还是大社区。你基本上就像牛一样，你会被牵着走，从一个牧场到另一个牧场。没有内识，心理环境就会超越你，把你压倒。内识是你内心更深层次的精神心智。它是你唯一不受心理环境影响的部分。它是你唯一不受欺骗和操控、完全自由的部分。</p>
<p>Do you want freedom for yourself? Then you must learn the way of Knowledge. Otherwise, what is freedom? Having more money? Working less, having more money? Is that freedom? Look at the wealthy who have no freedom. Oh, they have lots of money, and they can go anywhere they want. They do not even have to work, some of them. Are they free? Or are they slaves to their money and their situation and their privileges and their appetites and their fears?</p>
<p>你想要自己的自由吗？那你必须学习内识之路。否则，自由是什么？是拥有更多的钱？是工作更少、财富更多？这算得上自由吗？看看那些失去自由的富人。哦，他们拥有很多的钱，他们可以去任何他们想去的地方。他们中的一些人甚至不需要工作。他们真的自由吗？还是说，他们成为了自己金钱、处境、特权、欲望和恐惧的奴隶？</p>
<p>The message in The Allies of Humanity Briefings is about freedom. And to have freedom, you must become aware of the Intervention. You must gain a Greater Community perspective. You must learn about the mental environment and its impact upon you. And you must develop your experience of Knowledge. Not a lot of technology here though technology may play a small role in all of this.</p>
<p>人类的盟友简报中的讯息是关于自由的。而要想拥有自由，你必须察觉到干预的存在。你必须获得大社区的视角。你必须学习心理环境以及它对你的影响。你必须发展你的内识经验。尽管这里没有太多的技术，技术在这一切中可能起到一个微小的角色。</p>
<p>When we speak about learning the way of Knowledge, we are not talking about just developing intuition. That is not adequate. You must actually connect with the Knowing Mind within yourself, and this is not an easy task. There will be many who will be unwilling or unable to do this. But not everyone has to do this in order for humanity to turn the tide, to develop a Greater Community awareness and to begin to build boundaries around your world.</p>
<p>当我们谈论学习内识之路时，我们不是在谈论仅仅发展直觉。这是不够的。你必须真正与内心深处的知道心智建立联接，这并不是一件容易的事。将会有许多人不愿意或无法做到这一点。但并不是每个人都必须这样做，才能使人类扭转局势，发展大社区觉知，并开始在自己的世界周围建立界限。</p>
<p>Force cannot be used to take over a planet like yours. Therefore, the Intervention must be subtle. It must be deceptive. It must be invasive. It cannot use brute force. This is good for you because you could not withstand brute force. And brute force would destroy the outcome for the visitors, if you can call them visitors. There are many reasons why they will not use it.</p>
<p>武力不能用来占领像你们这样的星球。因此，干预必须是微妙的。它必须是欺骗性的。它必须是入侵性的。它不能使用蛮力。这对你们来说是好事，因为你们无法抵御蛮力。而蛮力会破坏来访者的结果，如果你能称他们为来访者的话。他们不使用蛮力的原因还有很多。</p>
<p>The Creator has responded to this great need of humanity, a need that is barely even recognized as a need, by presenting the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality. This teaching encompasses the reality of life in the Greater Community. Never has such a teaching been given in the world before because it was not needed before. Yes, there are many spiritual teachings that emphasize the way of Knowledge to a certain degree. But a Greater Community way of Knowledge has never been given in the world before. You need it now, however. It will not replace the world’s religions but instead give them a greater scope, a greater perspective, and a greater context in which to continue to grow, to exist and to evolve.</p>
<p>造物主回应了人类这个巨大的需求，一种几乎不被承认的需求，通过提出大社区精神性的教导来满足。这个教导涵盖了大社区生命的现实。世界上从来没有出现过这样的教导，因为以前并不需要。是的，确实有许多精神教导在一定程度上强调内识之路。但是，从未有过大社区的内识之路在这个世界上被传授。你们现在需要它。它不会取代世界上的宗教，而是给予它们一个更大的范围、一个更大的视角和一个更大的背景，在其中继续成长、存在和进化。</p>
<p>Yet it is curious that the world’s religious leaders will perhaps be the most resistant to learning a Greater Community Spirituality. To preserve their traditions, their authority and their power, they will perhaps deny the very thing that will give their tradition a future in the Greater Community. For without human freedom, there is no future. Without human self-determination, there is no future. And without an understanding of the Greater Community, there is no future for anyone here, not a future that you could embrace anyway.</p>
<p>然而，奇怪的是，世界上的宗教领袖也许是最抗拒学习大社区精神性的人。为了维护他们的传统、权威和权力，他们或许会否认将为他们的传统在大社区中提供未来的启示。因为没有人类的自由，就没有未来。没有人类的自决权，就没有未来。而没有对大社区的理解，这里的任何人都没有未来，无论如何，这都不是你能接受的未来。</p>
<p>You must see the relevance of this to yourself. All that you want out of life, all that you want to be, do and have, the Intervention could take it all away from you. Are you going to mindlessly pursue your personal goals and to hell with everything else, saying it doesn’t matter?</p>
<p>你必须看到这些内容与你自身的相关性。你想从生命中得到的一切，你想成为的一切，你想做的一切，你想拥有的一切，干预都可能将其夺走。难道你要无意识地追求个人目标吗？让其他一切都见鬼去吧，说什么都无所谓吗？</p>
<p>Even if the Intervention were not happening, the degradation of your natural resources and the growing population of the world would change what is available to you anyway. Some people say, “Well, I’m just going to go get what I want, and I’m not going to worry about anything else.” When people think like that, they are like locusts. Thrown upon the land, they are going to consume everything in sight. And they will leave a wasteland and move on until there is nowhere to move on to, and then they will all die out. Is this the promise for human advancement? To be like parasites that destroy the host and when the host dies, they all die too?</p>
<p>即使不进行干预，自然资源的退化和世界人口的增长也会改变你们能得到的资源。有些人说：”好吧，我只想得到我想要的，我不会担心其他事情。”当人们这样想的时候，他们就像蝗虫一样。它们被扔到土地上，就会吞噬眼前的一切。它们会留下一片荒地，继续前进，直到无处可去，然后全部灭绝。这就是人类对进步的承诺吗？就像寄生虫一样破坏宿主，当宿主死后，他们也会随之死去？</p>
<p>Now, most people would say, “Of course not! Absolutely not!” But if their behavior is self-seeking, then this is an appropriate analogy. Interestingly enough, those who are intervening in your world view humanity as a sort of destructive force in the world that is going to destroy this fabulous place. Their attitude is, “We’re going to get in there and stop them. And if they can’t use their world properly and preserve it, well, we’ll save it for ourselves. They can work for us.” This is exactly how they think. This is their perspective. This is how you would think if you were in their place. Even with all of humanity’s great idealism, you would think like this too. “We are not going to let them destroy this place! If they can’t benefit from it, we will!” This is exactly how a human government would respond. Perhaps this is how you personally would respond.</p>
<p>现在，大多数人会说：“当然不是！绝对不是！”但如果他们的行为是唯利是图的，那这就是一个合适的比喻。有趣的是，那些干预你们世界的集体视人类为一种破坏性力量，认为人类会毁掉这个美妙的地方。他们的态度是：“我们要进入这里，阻止他们。如果他们不能妥善利用和保护自己的世界，那我们就为自己保留它。让他们为我们工作。”这正是他们的想法。这是他们的视角。如果你处于他们的位置，你也会这样想。即使人类拥有伟大的理想主义，你也会这样想：“我们不会让他们摧毁这个地方！如果他们无法从中受益，我们就会！”这正是一个人类政府会做出的回应。也许这也是你个人会做出的回应。</p>
<p>Those intervening are not evil. They simply see the situation from a certain perspective. They are not guided by Knowledge or spirituality, or they would not be intervening here.</p>
<p>那些干预者并不邪恶。他们只是从一个特定的角度看待这种情况。如果他们受到内识或精神性的指导，他们就不会在这里进行干预。</p>
<p>There are people in the world who want the Intervention because they think that the alien races here will somehow save humanity from itself. They believe in the same perspective as the alien races themselves. Sometimes they reach this conclusion within themselves. Sometimes this thinking is encouraged through the Intervention. Yet the result is the same—loss of human freedom and self-determination, which will be very complete. If you think about this, you will realize that this is the worst possible scenario for you.</p>
<p>世界上有些人希望进行干预，因为他们认为这里的外星种族会以某种方式拯救人类本身。他们相信与外星种族本身相同的观点。有时他们在自己的内心也会得出这个结论，有时，这种想法会通过干预而得到鼓励。然而，结果是一样的——失去人类的自由和自决权，而这将是非常彻底的。如果你仔细想想，你会意识到这对你们来说是最糟糕的情景。</p>
<p>This is why the Creator is providing the preparation for the Greater Community. This is why it must be learned and taken to heart. This is why the awareness must be gained. People must face their fear and anxiety and realize the situation they are in. They must gain a new understanding of where they stand in the universe and their role and responsibility as the native peoples and stewards of this world. They must exercise the power that they have individually and collectively to preserve their own native grounds.</p>
<p>这就是为什么造物主要为大社区提供准备。这就是为什么必须学习它并将其铭记于心。这就是为什么必须获得这种觉知。人们必须面对自己的恐惧和焦虑，意识到自己所处的境地。他们必须对自己在宇宙中的位置，以及作为这个世界的原住民和管理者的角色和责任有一个新的理解。人类必须行使他们个人和集体所拥有的权力，以保护他们自己的原生地。</p>
<p>Your spiritual understanding needs to change for you to realize what God has given humanity to preserve the advancement of human freedom, understanding and cooperation. In the universe, these must be defended. You need to recognize that you have to outgrow your fantasies and your ideals, even your demands and expectations, to see the situation clearly. The Creator has asked the allies of humanity to be observers, to provide commentary and to present their message so that humanity can begin to gain a Greater Community perspective.</p>
<p>你的精神理解需要改变，才能认识到上帝赋予人类的使命，以维护人类自由、理解与合作的进步。在宇宙中，这些必须被捍卫。你需要认识到，要清晰地看待局势，就必须超越你的幻想、理想、要求和期待。造物主要求人类的盟友作为观察员，提供评述并提出他们的讯息，以便人类开始获得大社区的视角。</p>
<p>God has given a teaching about the mental environment and Knowledge. Learning the way of Knowledge is an individual spiritual journey for each person. Knowledge is the greater intelligence that lives within you. It knows how to deal with the Greater Community. Knowledge is not governed by human beliefs, assumptions, preoccupations, deceptions, ideals or ambitions. It is pure. It is the holy part of you. It knows. Your mind thinks. Knowledge knows. The gulf between them seems great, but they can be united together. And this is the ultimate goal of your spiritual development. This gift of Greater Community Spirituality is meant to give human freedom a real foundation, to empower the individual, to empower the group, to empower humanity, which is losing power every day to those who are intervening in the world.</p>
<p>上帝已经给出了关于心理环境和内识的教导。学习内识之路是每个人的个人精神旅程。内识是生活在你内心深处的更高智能。它知道如何应对大社区。内识不受人类信仰、假设、先入为主、欺骗、理想或野心的支配。它是纯粹的。它是你的神圣部分。它知道。你的心灵在思考。内识知道。它们之间的鸿沟似乎很大，但它们可以结合在一起。而这是你精神发展的最终目标。这份大社区精神性的礼物是为了给人类自由一个真正的基础，赋予个人力量，赋予集体力量，赋予人类力量，而人类每天都在被干预世界的集体剥夺力量。</p>
<p>We hope this discourse provides clarity, but it is really only the first step. Do not think you can read this discourse or read The Allies of Humanity Briefings and say, “Well, I understand now. I know what to do.” You do not yet know what to do. But you may be beginning to gain an understanding. If this stirs something within you deeply, then Knowledge within you is being activated. But there is much to learn ahead.</p>
<p>我们希望这次论述能提供一些明确性，但这其实只是第一步。不要认为你可以通过阅读这篇论述或人类的盟友简报就可以说：“好吧，我现在理解了。我知道该怎么做。”你还不知道该怎么做。但你可能已经开始获得一种理解。如果这能深深激起你内心深处的某种感受，那是你内心深处的内识正在被激活。但未来还有很多东西需要学习。</p>
<p>Humanity’s encounter with the realities of life beyond this world is a new threshold, perhaps the greatest threshold that humanity has ever faced. The learning will have to be rapid. Do not think you already know or understand. You do not. You may have an idea. You may experience a resonance with this message. You may feel it is important, but you still have to train and prepare. You don’t climb the highest mountain in the world because you love mountains. You don’t climb the highest mountain in the world because you have hiking boots. You have to train and prepare, or you won’t make it.</p>
<p>人类与这个世界之外的生命现实的相遇是一个新的门槛，也许是人类有史以来面临的最大的门槛。学习必须迅速进行。不要认为你已经知道或理解，你并不知道。你可能有一个想法。你可能会对这个讯息产生了共鸣。你可能觉得它很重要，但你仍然需要训练和准备。你不会因为喜欢大山而爬上世界上最高的山。你也不会因为你有登山鞋而爬上世界上最高的山峰。你必须训练和准备，否则你将无法成功。</p>
<p>This is the challenge of your time. This is the greatness of your time. This is where you will find your own greatness. You will never find your greatness in your individual pursuits, for there is no greatness there. You will only find your greatness in responding to a real need in the world and to the calling that lives within you even at this moment. This is the great situation that will bring out the greatness in you, if you can respond.</p>
<p>这是你们时代的挑战。这就是你们时代的伟大之处。你将在这里找到你自己的伟大之处。你永远不会在个人的追求中找到自己的伟大，因为这里没有伟大。你只有在回应世界的真实需求以及此时此刻生活在你内心深处的召唤时，才能发现自己的伟大。如果你能做出回应，这将是一个能激发你的伟大之处的绝佳环境。</p>
