We are the Allies of Humanity. This transmission is being made possible by the presence of the Unseen Ones, the spiritual counselors who oversee the development of intelligent life both within your world and throughout the Greater Community of worlds.</p>
<p>对我们来说，能够向所有有幸听到这个讯息的人介绍这些信息，是一种莫大的荣幸。我们是人类的盟友。这次传输是由不可见的存在促成的，他们是监督你们世界以及整个世界大社区智能生命发展的精神顾问。</p>
<p>We are not communicating through any mechanical device, but through a spiritual channel that is free from interference. Though we live in the physical, as do you, we are given the privilege to communicate in this way in order to deliver the information that we must share with you.</p>
<p>我们不是通过任何机械装置进行交流，而是通过一种免受干扰的精神通道。尽管我们和你们一样生活在物质世界中，但我们被赋予了以这种方式交流的特权，以便传递我们必须与你们分享的信息。</p>
<p>We represent a small group who are observing the events of your world. We come from the Greater Community. We do not interfere in human affairs. We have no establishment here. We have been sent for a very specific purpose—to witness the events that are occurring in your world and, given the opportunity to do so, to communicate to you what we see and what we know. For you live on the surface of your world and cannot see the affairs that surround it. Nor can you see clearly the visitation that is occurring in your world at this time or what it portends for your future.</p>
<p>我们代表着一个小型团体，正在观察你们世界的事件。我们来自大社区。我们不干涉人类事务。我们在这里没有任何机构。我们被派来是为了一个非常特定的目的——见证你们的世界正在发生的事件，并在有机会时，向你们传达我们所看到和所知道的事情。因为你们生活在世界的表面，无法看到围绕它的事态。你们也无法清晰地看到此时在你们世界中发生的访问，以及它对你们未来的预示。</p>
<p>We would like to give testimony to this. We are doing so at the request of the Unseen Ones, for we have been sent for this purpose. The information that we are about to impart to you may seem very challenging and startling. It is perhaps unexpected by many who will hear this message. We understand this difficulty, for we have had to face this within our own cultures.</p>
<p>我们希望对此作出见证。我们这样做是应不可见者的要求，因为我们是为了这个目的而来的。我们即将向你传达的信息可能看起来非常具有挑战性和令人震惊。对于许多听到这则讯息的人来说，这也许是意想不到的。我们理解这种困难，因为我们也曾在自己的文化中面临过这种情况。</p>
<p>As you hear the information, it may be difficult to accept at first, but it is vital for all who would seek to make a contribution in the world.</p>
<p>当你听到这些信息时，可能一开始难以接受，但对于所有想在这个世界上做出贡献的人来说，这至关重要。</p>
<p>For many years we have been observing the affairs of your world. We seek no relations with humanity. We are not here on a diplomatic mission. We have been sent by the Unseen Ones to live in the proximity of your world in order to observe the events we are about to describe.</p>
<p>多年来，我们一直在观察你们世界的事务。我们不寻求与人类建立关系，我们也不是为了外交任务而来。我们是受不可见者的派遣，驻留在你们世界的附近，以便观察我们即将描述的事件。</p>
<p>Our names are not important. They would be meaningless to you. And we shall not impart them for our own safety, for we must remain hidden in order that we may serve.</p>
<p>我们的名字并不重要。它们对你们来说毫无意义。为了我们自身的安全，我们也不会透露它们，因为我们必须保持隐蔽，以便我们可以服务。</p>
<p>To begin, it is necessary for people everywhere to understand that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life. Your world is being “visited” by several alien races and by several different organizations of races. This has been actively going on for some time. There have been visitations throughout human history, but nothing of this magnitude. The advent of nuclear weapons and the destruction of your natural world have brought these forces to your shores.</p>
<p>首先，世界各地的人们有必要理解，人类正出现在一个智能生命的大社区之中。你们的世界正受到几个外星种族和几个不同种族组织的“访问”。这种活动已经持续了一段时间。纵观人类历史，曾经有过类似的访问，但从未有过如此规模。核武器的出现以及你们对自然世界的破坏，将这些力量带到了你们的海岸。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today, we understand, who are beginning to realize that this is occurring. And we understand as well that there are many interpretations of this visitation—what it could mean and what it could offer. And many of the people who are aware of these things are very hopeful and anticipate a great benefit for humanity. We understand. It is natural to expect this. It is natural to be hopeful.</p>
<p>我们理解，当今世界上有许多人开始意识到这种情况正在发生。我们也理解，对于这次访问也存在着许多不同的解读——它可能意味着什么，以及它可能带来什么。许多察觉到这些事情的人充满着希望，并期待这会给人类带来的巨大益处。我们理解这一点。这种期望是自然的，充满希望也是自然的。</p>
<p>The visitation in your world now is very extensive, so much so that people in all parts of the world are witnessing it and are experiencing its effects directly. What has brought these “visitors” from the Greater Community, these different organizations of beings, is not to promote the advancement of humanity or the spiritual education of humanity. What has brought these forces to your shores in such numbers with such intention are the resources of your world.</p>
<p>现在你们世界中的访问非常广泛，以至于世界各地的人们都在目睹它，并直接感受到它的影响。将这些来自大社区的“来访者”，这些不同组织的生命吸引而来的，并不是为了促进人类的进步或人类的精神教育。是你们世界的资源，吸引着这些力量带着如此多的意图来到你们的海岸。</p>
<p>This we understand may be difficult to accept at first because you cannot yet appreciate how beautiful your world is, how much it possesses and what a rare jewel it is in a Greater Community of barren worlds and empty space. Worlds such as yours are rare indeed. Most places in the Greater Community that are inhabited now have been colonized, and technology has made this possible. But worlds such as yours where life has evolved naturally, without the aid of technology, are far more rare than you might realize. Others take great notice of this, of course, for the biological resources of your world have been used by several races for millennia. It is considered a storehouse for some. And yet the development of human culture and dangerous weapons and the deterioration of these resources have caused the alien Intervention.</p>
<p>我们理解，这一事实可能一开始很难接受，因为你们还无法真正欣赏到你们的世界是多么美丽，它拥有多少资源，以及在一个由贫瘠的世界和空旷的空间组成的大社区中，它是多么稀有的宝石。像你们这样的世界确实很稀有。在大社区中大多数被居住的地方现在都是通过殖民化实现的，科技使其成为可能。然而，像你们这样没有科技帮助，自然进化的世界，比你们想象的要稀有得多。当然，其他种族也对此非常关注，因为你们世界的生物资源数千年来一直被几个种族使用着。对一些种族来说，这被视为一个储藏室。然而，人类文化的发展、危险武器的出现以及这些资源的恶化，导致了外星的干预。</p>
<p>Perhaps you might wonder why diplomatic efforts are not established to contact the leaders of humanity. This is reasonable to ask, but the difficulty here is that there is no one to represent humanity, for your people are divided, and your nations oppose one another. It is also assumed by these visitors that we speak of that you are warlike and aggressive and that you would bring harm and hostility to the universe around you despite your good qualities.</p>
<p>你可能会想，为什么不通过外交途径来联系人类的领导者。这是一个合理的问题，但困难在于没有人能代表人类，因为你们的人民是分裂的，你们的国家彼此对立。这些来访者也认为你们是好战且具有攻击性的，尽管你们有良好的品质，但你们可能会给周围的宇宙带来伤害和敌意。</p>
<p>Therefore, in our discourse we want to give you an idea of what is occurring, what it will mean for humanity and how it is related to your spiritual development, your social development and your future in the world and in the Greater Community of worlds itself.</p>
<p>因此，在我们的论述中，我们想让你们了解目前正在发生的事情，它对人类意味着什么，以及它如何与你们的精神发展、你们的社会发展和你们在世界以及世界大社区本身的未来有何关系。</p>
<p>People are unaware of the presence of alien forces, unaware of the presence of resource explorers, of those who would seek an alliance with humanity for their own benefit. Perhaps we should begin here by giving you an idea of what life is like beyond your shores, for you have not journeyed afar and cannot account for these things yourself.</p>
<p>人们没有察觉到外星力量的存在，也没有察觉到资源勘探者的存在，更没有察觉到那些为了自身利益而寻求与人类结盟的存在。或许我们应该从这里开始，让你们了解你们海岸以外的生命是什么样的，因为你们还未曾远行，无法自行知道这些情况。</p>
<p>You live in a part of the galaxy that is quite inhabited. Not all parts of the galaxy are so inhabited. There are great unexplored regions. There are many hidden races. Trade and commerce between worlds are only carried on in certain areas. The environment that you will emerge into is a very competitive one. The need for resources is experienced everywhere, and many technological societies have outstripped their world’s natural resources and must trade, barter and travel to gain what they need. It is a very complicated situation. Many alliances are formed and conflicts do occur.</p>
<p>你们生活在一个相当繁盛的银河区域，并非整个银河系都如此繁盛。这里有广阔的未探索区域，也有许多隐藏的种族。世界之间的贸易和商业活动仅在特定区域进行。你们即将进入的环境是一个竞争激烈的环境。资源的需求在各处都很强烈，许多技术先进的社会已经耗尽了他们世界的自然资源，因此必须通过贸易、交换和旅行来获取所需。这是一个非常复杂的局面，许多联盟因此形成，冲突也时有发生。</p>
<p>Perhaps at this point it is necessary to realize that the Greater Community into which you are emerging is a difficult environment and a challenging one, and yet it brings great opportunity and great possibilities for humanity. However, for these possibilities and these advantages to be realized, humanity must prepare and come to learn what life in the universe is like. And it must come to understand what spirituality means within a Greater Community of intelligent life.</p>
<p>也许在这一点上，我们有必要认识到，你们即将进入的大社区是一个充满挑战且艰难的环境，但它同时也为人类带来了巨大的机会和可能性。然而，要实现这些可能性和优势，人类必须做好准备，学会了解宇宙中的生命是什么样的。同时，人类也必须理解，在一个由智能生命组成的大社区中，精神性的意义。</p>
<p>We understand from our own history that this is the greatest threshold that any world will ever face. It is not something, however, that you can plan for yourself. It is not something that you can design for your own future. For the very forces that would bring the Greater Community reality here are already present in the world. Circumstances have brought them here. They are here.</p>
<p>我们从自己的历史中了解到，这是任何世界都将面临的最大门槛。然而，这并不是你们可以自行规划的事情。你们无法为自己的未来自行设计这个过程。因为将大社区的现实带到这里的力量，已经存在于这个世界上。环境已经把它们带到了这里。他们就在这里。</p>
<p>Perhaps this gives you an idea of what life is like beyond your borders. We do not want to create an idea that is fearful, but it is necessary for your own well-being and for your future that you have an honest appraisal and can come to see these things clearly.</p>
<p>也许这能让你对边界之外的生命有个初步的理解。我们并不想创造一个令人恐惧的想法，但为了你们自己的福祉和你们的未来，你需要进行诚实的评估，才能清晰地看到这些事情。</p>
<p>The need to prepare for life in the Greater Community, we feel, is the greatest need there is in your world today. And yet, from our observation, people are preoccupied with their own affairs and their own problems in their daily lives, unaware of the greater forces that will change their destiny and affect their future.</p>
<p>我们认为，为大社区的生命做好准备是当今世界上最大的需求。然而，根据我们的观察，人们在日常生活中专注于自己的事务和自己的问题，没有察觉到将改变他们的天命和影响他们未来的更大力量。</p>
<p>The forces and groups who are here today represent several different alliances. These different alliances are not united with each other in their efforts. Each alliance represents several different racial groups who are collaborating for the purpose of gaining access to your world’s resources and maintaining this access. These different alliances are, in essence, competing with each other though they are not at war with one another. They see your world as a great prize, something they want to have for themselves.</p>
<p>如今来到你们世界的力量和团体代表着几个不同的联盟。这些联盟在其行动中并非彼此统一。每个联盟都代表了若干不同的种族群体，他们合作的目的是为了获取你们世界的资源，并维持对这些资源的访问权。这些不同的联盟本质上是在彼此竞争，尽管他们之间并不存在战争。他们视你们的世界为一个巨大的奖赏，想要将其占为己有。</p>
<p>This creates a very great challenge for your people, for the forces who are visiting you not only have advanced technology, but also strong social cohesion and are able to influence thought in the mental environment. You see, in the Greater Community, technology is easily acquired, and so the great advantage between competing societies is the ability to influence thought. This has taken on very sophisticated demonstrations. It represents a set of skills that humanity is only beginning to discover.</p>
<p>这给你们的人民带来了非常大的挑战，因为访问你们的势力不仅有先进的技术，而且还有强大的社会凝聚力，能够影响心理环境中的思想。你看，在大社区，技术很容易获得，因此，竞争社会之间的巨大优势是影响思想的能力。这种影响思想的能力已经展现出非常复杂和精妙的形式，它代表了一套人类才刚刚开始发现的技能。</p>
<p>As a result, your visitors do not come armed with great weapons or with armies or with armadas of vessels. They come in relatively small groups, but they possess considerable skill in influencing people. This represents a more sophisticated and mature use of power in the Greater Community. It is this ability that humanity will have to cultivate in the future if it is to contend with other races successfully.</p>
<p>因此，你们的来访者并未带着强大的武器、军队或舰队来到这里。他们是以相对较小的团体出现，但他们在影响人们方面具有相当高的技巧。这显示了在大社区中更加复杂和成熟的力量运用方式。如果人类要在未来成功地与其他种族抗衡，就必须在未来培养这种能力。</p>
<p>The visitors are here to gain humanity’s allegiance. They do not want to destroy human establishments or the human presence. Instead, they wish to use these for their own benefit. Their intention is employment, not destruction. They feel that they are in the right because they believe that they are saving the world. Some even believe that they are saving humanity from itself. But this perspective does not serve your greater interests, nor does it foster wisdom or self-determination within the human family.</p>
<p>这些来访者来到这里是为了获得人类的忠诚。他们不想摧毁人类的机构或人类的存在，相反，他们希望利用这些为他们自身谋利。他们的意图是使用，而非破坏。他们觉得自己是正确的，因为他们相信自己是在拯救世界，有些种族甚至认为他们是正在拯救人类本身。但这种观点并不符合你们更大的利益，也不会促进人类大家庭内部的智慧和自决。</p>
<p>Yet because there are forces of good within the Greater Community of Worlds, you have allies. We represent the voice of your allies, the Allies of Humanity. We are not here to use your resources or to take from you what you possess. We do not seek to establish humanity as a client state or as a colony for our own use. Instead, we wish to foster strength and wisdom within humanity because we support this throughout the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然而，因为在世界大社区中也存在着善的力量，你们是有盟友的。我们代表着你们盟友的声音，人类的盟友。我们在这里不是为了使用你们的资源，也不是为了从你们这里夺取你们所拥有的资源。我们并不寻求将人类建立为我们的附属国或殖民地。相反，我们希望在人类中培养力量和智慧，因为我们在大社区中支持着这样的自由。</p>
<p>Our role, then, is quite essential, and our information is very needed because at this time even people who are aware of the presence of the visitors are not yet aware of their intentions. People do not understand the visitors’ methods. And they do not comprehend the visitors’ ethics or morality. People think the visitors are either angels or monsters. But in reality, they are very much like you in their needs. If you could see the world through their eyes, you would understand their consciousness and their motivation. But to do that, you would have to venture beyond your own.</p>
<p>因此，我们的角色是相当重要的，我们提供的信息也非常必要，因为即使在这个时候，即使是那些已经察觉到来访者存在的人们，也尚未察觉到他们的意图。人们不理解来访者的方法，也不理解他们的道德或伦理。人们要么将来访者视为天使，要么视为怪物。但实际上，他们的需求和你们非常相似。如果你能通过他们的眼睛看待世界，你就会理解他们的意识和动机。但要做到这一点，你就必须冒险超越你自己。</p>
<p>The visitors are engaged in four fundamental activities in order to gain influence within your world. Each of these activities is unique, but they are all coordinated together. They are being carried out because humanity has been studied for a long time. Human thought, human behavior, human physiology and human religion have been studied for some time. These are well understood by your visitors and will be used for their own purposes.</p>
<p>为了在你们世界中获得影响力，来访者正在进行四项基本活动。每一项活动都是独特的，但它们都是相互协调的。这些活动之所以开展，是因为人类已经被研究了很长时间。人类的思想、人类的行为、人类的生理学和人类的宗教已经被研究了一段时间。这些都被你们的来访者很好地理解，并将被用于他们自己的目的。</p>
<p>The first area of activity of the visitors is to influence individuals in positions of power and authority. Because the visitors do not want to destroy anything in the world or harm the world’s resources, they seek to gain influence over those whom they perceive to be in positions of power, within government and religion primarily. They seek contact, but only with certain individuals. They have the power to make this contact, and they have the power of persuasion. Not all whom they contact will be persuaded, but many will be. The promise of greater power, greater technology and world domination will intrigue and incite many individuals. And it is these individuals with whom the visitors will seek to establish a liaison.</p>
<p>来访者的第一个活动领域是影响处于权力和权威地位的个人。因为来访者不想破坏世界上的任何资源或损害世界上的资源，他们寻求对那些他们认为有权力地位的人施加影响，主要是政府和宗教领域的领导者。他们寻求接触，但仅限于特定的个人。他们拥有进行这种接触的能力，而且他们具有说服的力量。不是所有与他们接触的人都会被说服，但很多人会被说服。更大的权力、更高的科技和统治世界的承诺将激起许多人的兴趣和野心。正是这些人，来访者将寻求与他们建立联系。</p>
<p>There are very few people in the governments of the world who are being so affected, but their numbers are growing. The visitors understand the hierarchy of power because they themselves live by it, following their own chain of command, you might say. They are highly organized and very focused in their endeavors, and the idea of having cultures full of free-thinking individuals is largely foreign to them. They do not comprehend or understand individual freedom. They are like many technologically advanced societies in the Greater Community who function both within their respective worlds and in their establishments across vast reaches of space, utilizing a very well-established and rigid form of government and organization. They believe that humanity is chaotic and unruly, and they feel they are bringing order to a situation that they cannot themselves comprehend. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not see its value. As a result, what they seek to establish in the world will not honor this freedom.</p>
<p>世界上只有少数政府官员受到了这样的影响，但他们的数量正在增加。来访者理解权力的等级制度，因为他们自己也生活在这个等级制度中，可以说，他们遵循自己的指挥链。他们在行动中高度组织和专注，对于拥有自由思想个体的文化，他们基本上感到陌生。他们无法理解或认同个人的自由。他们就像大社区中许多技术先进的社会一样，这些社会无论在各自的世界还是在跨越广阔空间的机构中，都依靠非常成熟且严格的政府和组织形式运作。他们认为人类是混乱和无序的，他们觉得自己正在为他们无法理解的情况带来秩序。对他们而言，个人自由是未知的，他们看不到它的价值。因此，他们试图在世界上建立的秩序将不会尊重这种自由。</p>
<p>Therefore, their first area of endeavor is to establish a liaison with individuals in positions of power and influence in order to gain their allegiance and to persuade them of the beneficial aspects of relationship and shared purpose.</p>
<p>因此，他们的第一个目标是与处于权力和影响力地位的个人建立联系，以获得他们的效忠，并说服他们相信建立关系和共同宗旨的益处。</p>
<p>The second avenue of activity, which is perhaps the most difficult to consider from your perspective, is the manipulation of religious values and impulses. The visitors understand that humanity’s greatest abilities also represent its greatest vulnerability. People’s longing for individual redemption represents one of the greatest assets the human family has to offer, even to the Greater Community. But it is also your weakness. And it is these impulses and these values that will be used.</p>
<p>第二个活动领域，从你们的角度来看，可能是最难以理解的，那就是对宗教价值观和冲动的操控。来访者知道，人类最大的能力也代表了其最大的弱点。人们对个人救赎的渴望是人类大家族所拥有的最伟大的资产之一，甚至对大社区来说也是如此。但这也是你们的弱点。而正是这些冲动和价值观将被利用。</p>
<p>Several groups of the visitors wish to establish themselves as spiritual agents because they know how to speak in the mental environment. They can communicate to people directly, and unfortunately, because there are very few people in the world who can discern the difference between a spiritual voice and the visitors’ voice, the situation becomes very difficult.</p>
<p>一些来访者群体希望将自己确立为精神代理人，因为他们知道如何在心理环境中说话。他们可以直接与人们交流，而不幸的是，因为世界上很少有人能分辨出精神的声音和来访者的声音之间的区别，所以情况变得非常复杂。</p>
<p>Therefore, the second area of activity is to gain people’s allegiance through their religious and spiritual motivations. Actually, this can be done quite easily because humanity is not yet strong or developed in the mental environment. It is difficult for people to discern where these impulses are coming from. Many people want to give themselves to anything they think has a greater voice and a greater power. Your visitors can project images—images of your saints, of your teachers, of angels—images that are held dear and sacred within your world. They have cultivated this ability through many, many centuries of attempting to influence each other and by learning the ways of persuasion that are practiced in many places in the Greater Community. They consider you primitive, and so they feel they can exert this influence and use these methods upon you.</p>
<p>因此，第二个活动领域是通过人们的宗教和精神动机来赢得他们的效忠。实际上，这相对容易实现，因为人类在心理环境中还不够强大或成熟。人们很难辨别这些冲动的来源。许多人想要把自己交给他们认为拥有更大声音和更大力量的精神。你们的来访者可以投射形象——你们的圣人、你们的老师、天使的形象——这些都是在你们的世界中被视为珍贵和神圣的形象。他们通过几个世纪的相互影响，以及学习大社区各地的说服技巧，培养了这种能力。他们认为你们是原始的，所以他们觉得自己可以施加这种影响并对你们使用这些方法。</p>
<p>Here there is an attempt to contact those individuals who are considered sensitive, receptive and naturally given to be cooperative. Many people will be selected, but a few will be chosen based upon these particular qualities. Your visitors will seek to gain allegiance with these individuals, to gain their trust and to gain their devotion, telling the recipients that the visitors are here to uplift humanity spiritually, to give humanity new hope, new blessings and new power—indeed promising the things that people want so dearly but have not yet found themselves. Perhaps you may wonder, “How can such a thing occur?” But we can assure you that it is not difficult once you learn these skills and abilities.</p>
<p>在这里，来访者试图接触那些被认为敏感、易接受并且天生愿意合作的人。许多人将被选中，但其中只有少数人会因这些特殊品质而被选中。来访者将试图赢得这些人的效忠，赢得他们的信任，并获得他们的奉献，他们会告诉这些受众，来访者是为了在精神上提升人类，为人类带来新的希望、新的祝福和新的力量——这的确是人们梦寐以求却尚未找到的力量。或许你会想，“这种事情怎么可能会发生呢？”但我们可以向你保证，一旦你学会了这些技巧和能力，这并不困难。</p>
<p>The effort here is to pacify and to reeducate people through spiritual persuasion. This “Pacification Program” is used differently with different religious groups depending upon their ideals and their temperament. It is always aimed at receptive individuals. Here it is hoped that people will lose their sense of discernment and will become wholly trusting of the greater power that they feel is being given to them by the visitors. Once this allegiance is established, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to discern what they know within themselves from what is being told to them. It is a very subtle but very pervasive form of persuasion and manipulation. We shall speak more on this as we proceed.</p>
<p>这里的努力是通过精神上的说服来安抚人们并重新教育人们。这种“绥靖计划”会根据不同宗教团体的理想和气质，以不同的方式使用。目标始终是那些易于接受的人。在这里，他们希望人们失去自己的辨别力，完全信任来访者赋予他们的更强大的力量。一旦这种忠诚建立起来，人们就很难将他们内心所知道的与被告知的区分开来。这是一种非常微妙但非常普遍的说服和操纵形式。我们将在后面对此进行更多讨论。</p>
<p>Let us now mention the third area of activity, which is to establish the visitors’ presence in the world and to have people become used to this presence. They want humanity to become acclimated to this very great change that is occurring in your midst—to have you become acclimated to the visitors’ physical presence and to their effect on your own mental environment. To serve this purpose, they will create establishments here, though not in view. These establishments will be hidden, but they will be very powerful in casting an influence on human populations that are near them. The visitors will take great care and time to make sure that these establishments are effective and that enough people are in allegiance to them. It is these people who will guard and preserve the visitors’ presence.</p>
<p>现在让我们提到第三个活动领域，即在世界范围内建立来访者的存在，并让人们习惯于这种存在。他们想让人类适应正在你们中间发生的这一巨大变化——让你们适应来访者的物理存在及以及他们对你们自身心理环境的影响。为了达到这个目的，他们将在这里建立机构，虽然不是在众目睽睽之下。这些机构将是隐藏的，但它们将对靠近它们的人群产生非常强大的影响。来访者将花费大量的时间和精力来确保这些机构是有效的，并且有足够多的人忠于他们。正是这些人将保护和维护来访者的存在。</p>
<p>This is exactly what is occurring in your world at this time. It represents a great challenge and unfortunately a great risk. This very same thing that we are describing has happened so many times in so many places in the Greater Community. And emerging races such as your own are always the most vulnerable. Some emerging races are able to establish their own awareness, ability and cooperation to the extent that they can offset outside influences such as these and establish a presence and a position in the Greater Community. Yet many races, before they even attain this freedom, fall under the control and influence of foreign powers.</p>
<p>这正是目前在你们的世界中发生的事情。它代表了一个巨大的挑战，不幸的是，也代表了巨大的风险。我们正在描述的这种事情已经在大社区的许多地方发生了很多次。像你们这样的新兴种族总是最脆弱的。一些新兴种族能够建立自己的觉知、能力与合作，以至于他们能够抵消像这样的外部影响，并在大社区中建立自己的存在和地位。然而，许多种族甚至在获得这种自由之前，就已经落入了外来势力的控制和影响之下。</p>
<p>We understand that this information may incite considerable fear and perhaps denial or confusion. But as we observe events, we realize that there are very few people who are aware of the situation as it actually exists. Even those people who are becoming aware of the presence of alien forces are not in a position and do not have the vantage point from which they can see the situation clearly. And being ever hopeful and optimistic, they seek to give this great phenomenon as much positive meaning as they can.</p>
<p>我们理解，这些信息可能会激起相当大的恐惧，也可能会引起否认或混乱。但是，当我们观察事件时，我们意识到，很少有人察觉到实际存在的情况。即使是那些开始察觉到外星力量存在的人，他们也不具备能够看清形势的位置和有利条件。他们总是充满希望和乐观，他们试图尽可能地赋予这种显著现象以积极的意义。</p>
<p>However, the Greater Community is a competitive environment, a difficult environment. Those who engage in space travel do not necessarily represent the spiritually advanced, for those who are spiritually advanced seek insulation from the Greater Community. They do not seek commerce. They do not seek to influence other races or to engage in the very complex array of relationships that are established for mutual trade and benefit. Instead, the spiritually advanced seek to remain hidden. This is a very different understanding, perhaps, but a necessary one for you to come to comprehend the great predicament that humanity is facing. Yet this predicament holds great possibilities. We would like to speak about these now.</p>
<p>然而，大社区是一个充满竞争的环境，一个艰难的环境。那些从事太空旅行的种族并不一定代表精神上先进的存在，因为那些精神上先进的种族寻求与大社区的隔离。他们不寻求商业，他们不寻求影响其他种族，也不参与为相互贸易和利益而建立的一系列非常复杂的关系。相反，精神上先进的种族寻求保持隐匿。这可能是一个非常不同的理解，但对于你理解人类所面临的巨大困境来说是一个必要的理解。然而，这个困境也蕴含着伟大的可能性。我们现在想谈谈这些可能性。</p>
<p>Despite the gravity of the situation that we are describing, we do not feel that these circumstances are a tragedy for humanity. Indeed, if these circumstances can be recognized and understood, and if the preparation for the Greater Community, which now exists in the world, can be utilized, studied and applied, then people everywhere of good conscience will have the ability to learn Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Thus, people everywhere will be able to find the basis for cooperation so that the human family can finally establish a unity that has never been established here before. For it will take the overshadowing of the Greater Community to unite humanity. And this overshadowing is occurring now.</p>
<p>尽管我们描述的情况十分严峻，但我们并不认为这些环境对人类来说是一个悲剧。事实上，如果这些情况能够被认识和理解，如果可以善用、研究和应用目前世界上存在的大社区的准备工作，那么各地有良知的人们将有能力学习大社区的内识和智慧。因此，各地的人们将能够找到合作的基础，从而使人类大家庭最终能够在这里建立一种前所未有的团结。因为需要大社区的阴影来团结人类。而这种阴影现在正在发生。</p>
<p>It is your evolution to emerge into a Greater Community of intelligent life. It will happen whether you are prepared or not. It must occur. Preparation, then, becomes the key. Understanding and clarity—these are the things that are necessary and needed in your world at this time.</p>
<p>这是你们的进化，要出现在一个智能生命的大社区之中。无论你们是否准备好，它都会发生。它必须发生。因此，准备就成了关键。理解和清晰——这些都是你们的世界在这个时候所必需和需要的准备。</p>
<p>People everywhere have great spiritual gifts that can enable them to see and to know clearly. These gifts are needed now. They need to be recognized, employed and shared freely. It is not merely up to a great teacher or a great saint in your world to do this. It must be cultivated by many more people now. For the situation brings with it necessity, and if necessity can be embraced, it brings with it great opportunity.</p>
<p>世界各地的人们都拥有伟大的精神礼物，能够让他们看得清楚，知道得明白。现在就需要这些礼物。它们需要被认识、运用并自由分享。这不仅仅是你们世界上的一位伟大老师或伟大圣人所能做到的。现在必须有更多的人来培养它。因为这种情况带来了必要性，而如果能够拥抱这种必要性，就会带来伟大的机会。</p>
<p>However, the requirements to learn about the Greater Community and to begin to experience Greater Community Spirituality are tremendous. Never before have human beings had to learn such things in such a short period of time. Indeed, such things have rarely been learned ever by anyone in your world before. But now the need has changed. The circumstances are different. Now there are new influences in your midst, influences that you can feel and that you can know.</p>
<p>然而，学习关于大社区的内识并开始体验大社区精神性的要求是巨大的。人类从未在如此短的时间内学习过内识。事实上，在你们的世界里，以前很少有人能学到内识。但现在的需求已经改变。情况不同了。现在有新的影响在你们中间，你可以感受到这些影响，你也可以知道这些影响。</p>
<p>The visitors seek to disable people from having this vision and this Knowledge within themselves, for your visitors do not have it within themselves. They do not see its value. They do not understand its reality. In this, humanity as a whole is more advanced than they are. But this is only a potential, a potential which must now be cultivated.</p>
<p>来访者试图使人们无法在自己的内心深处中拥有这种视野和内识，因为你们的来访者自身并不具备这些。他们看不到内识的价值，也不理解内识的现实。在这方面，人类整体上比他们更为先进。但这只是一种潜力，一种现在必须加以培养的潜力。</p>
<p>The alien presence in the world is growing. It is growing every day, every year. Many more people are falling under its persuasion, losing their ability to know, becoming confused and distracted, believing in things that can only weaken them and make them impotent in the face of those who would seek to use them for their own purposes.</p>
<p>外星存在在这个世界上的影响正日益增长。它每天、每年都在增长。更多的人正在被它说服，失去他们知道的能力，变得困惑和分心，相信那些只会削弱他们，使他们在面对试图利用他们为自身目的的外星存在时变得无能的事物。</p>
<p>Humanity is an emerging race. It is vulnerable. It is facing a set of circumstances and influences now which it has never had to face before. You have only evolved to compete with each other. You have never had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. Yet it is this competition that will strengthen you and will call forth your greatest attributes if the situation can be clearly seen and understood.</p>
<p>人类是一个新兴的种族。它是脆弱的。它现在正面临着一系列的情况和影响，这是它以前从未遇到过的。你们的进化只是为了相互竞争。你们从来没有与其他形式的智能生命竞争过。然而，如果情况能够被清晰地看见和理解，正是这种竞争将会加强你们，并将唤起你们最伟大的特质。</p>
<p>It is the role of the Unseen Ones to foster this strength. The Unseen Ones, whom you would rightly call angels, do not only speak to the human heart but to hearts everywhere who are able to listen and who have gained the freedom to listen.</p>
<p>不可见者的角色是培养这种力量。不可见者，你们可以正确地称之为天使，它不仅对人类的内心讲话，也对宇宙中每个能够倾听并获得倾听自由的生命的内心讲话。</p>
<p>We come, then, with a difficult message, but a message of promise and hope. Perhaps it is not the message that people want to hear. It is certainly not the message that the visitors would promote. It is a message that can be shared from person to person, and it will be shared because it is natural to do so. Yet the visitors and those who have come under their persuasion will oppose such an awareness. They do not want to see an independent humanity. That is not their purpose. They do not even believe it is beneficial. Therefore, it is our sincere desire that these ideas be considered without trepidation, but with a serious mind and a deep concern that are well justified here.</p>
<p>因此，我们带着一个困难的讯息而来，但却是一条充满承诺和希望的讯息。也许这不是人们想听到的讯息。但它肯定不是来访者会推广的讯息。这是一个可以在人与人之间传递的讯息，它会被分享，因为这样做是自然的。然而，来访者和那些受到他们影响的人将会反对这样的觉知。他们不希望看到一个独立的人类。那不是他们的目的。他们甚至不相信这样做是有益的。因此，我们真诚地希望这些想法能够被认真考虑，而不是带有恐惧，但却怀着严肃的心态和深切的关切来进行，在这里是完全合理的。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today, we understand, who feel that a great change is coming for humanity. The Unseen Ones have told us these things. Many causes are attributed to this sense of change. And many outcomes are predicted. Yet unless you can begin to comprehend the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life, you do not yet have the right context for understanding the destiny of humanity or the great change that is occurring in the world.</p>
<p>我们理解，当今世界上有许多人感觉到人类即将迎来一场巨大的变革。不可见者已经告诉我们这些事情。造成这种变化的原因有很多。而且还预测了许多结果。。然而，除非你开始理解人类正在进入一个智能生命大社区的现实，否则你还没有正确的背景来理解人类的天命或世界上正在发生的重大变化。</p>
<p>From our perspective, people are born into their time to serve that time. This is a teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, a teaching of which we are students as well. It teaches freedom and the power of shared purpose. It grants authority to the individual and to the individual who can join with others—ideas which are rarely accepted or adopted in the Greater Community, for the Greater Community is not the heavenly state. It is a physical reality with the rigors of survival and all that that entails. All beings within this reality must contend with these needs and issues. And in this, your visitors are more like you than you realize. They are not incomprehensible. They would seek to be incomprehensible, but they can be understood. You have the power to do this, but you must see with clear eyes. You must see with a greater vision and know with a greater intelligence, which you have the possibility to cultivate within yourselves.</p>
<p>从我们的角度来看，人们生来就是为这个时代服务的。这是大社区精神性的教导，我们也是这个教导的学生。它教导自由和共同宗旨的力量。它赋予个人权威，并赋予个人与他人联合的权力——这些想法在大社区中很少被接受或采纳，因为大社区并非天堂状态。它是一个物质的现实，有着生存的严酷性以及生存所带来的一切问题。在这个现实中，所有存在都必须面对这些需求和问题。在这一点上，你们的来访者与你们其实很相似。他们并非难以理解。虽然他们会试图让自己难以理解，但实际上是可以被理解的。你拥有这样做的力量，但你必须用清晰的眼睛去看。你必须用更高的视觉去看，并用更高的智能去知道，你有可能在自己的内心深处培养这种能力。</p>
<p>It is necessary for us now to speak more regarding the second area of influence and persuasion because this has great importance, and it is our sincere desire that you will understand these things and consider them for yourself.</p>
<p>现在，我们有必要更多地谈谈影响力和说服力的第二个方面，因为这一点非常重要，我们衷心希望你能够理解这些事情，并为自己思考。</p>
<p>The religions of the world hold the key to human dedication and human allegiance, more than governments, more than any other institution. This speaks well for humanity because religions such as these are often hard to find in the Greater Community. Your world is rich in this respect, but your strength is also where you are weak and vulnerable. Many people want to be divinely guided and appointed, to give over the reins of their own lives and to have a greater spiritual power direct them, counsel them and preserve them. This is a genuine desire, but within a Greater Community context, considerable wisdom must be cultivated in order for this desire to be fulfilled. It is very sad for us to see how people will give their authority away so easily—something they have never even fully had, they will give away willingly to those who are unknown to them.</p>
<p>世界上的宗教掌握着人类奉献和人类忠诚的关键，超过了政府和其他任何机构。这充分说明了人性的美好，因为像这样的宗教在大社区往往很难找到。在这方面，你们的世界非常丰富，但你们的力量也是你们的弱点和脆弱之处。许多人希望得到神圣的引导和任命，交出自己生活的缰绳，由更大的精神力量来指导他们，辅导他们，保护他们。这是一个真实的愿望，但在大社区的背景下，为了实现这种愿望，必须培养相当的智慧。看到人们如此轻易地放弃他们的权威，对我们来说是非常悲伤的——他们甚至从未完全拥有过权威，他们却心甘情愿地将它交给陌生的来访者。</p>
<p>This message is destined to reach people who have a greater spiritual affinity. Therefore, it is necessary that we elaborate on this subject. We advocate a spirituality that is taught in the Greater Community, not the spirituality that is governed by nations, governments or political alliances, but a natural spirituality—the ability to know, to see and to act. And yet this is not emphasized by your visitors. They seek to have people believe that the visitors are their family, that the visitors are their home, that the visitors are their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers. Many people want to believe, and so they believe. People want to give over their personal authority, and so it is given over. People want to see friends and salvation in the visitors, and so this is what they are shown.</p>
<p>这个讯息注定会传达给那些具有更高精神亲和力的人。因此，我们有必要详细阐述这个话题。我们倡导一种在大社区中传授的精神性，而非由国家、政府或政治联盟主导的精神性，而是一种自然的精神性——即知道、看见和行动的能力。然而，你们的来访者并没有强调这一点。他们试图让人们相信，来访者是他们的家人，是他们的家，是他们的兄弟姐妹，是他们的父母。许多人想要相信，因此他们相信。人们想要放弃个人的权威，于是权威就被放弃了。人们想在来访者身上看到朋友和救赎，所以这就是他们所要展示的。</p>
<p>It will take great sobriety and objectivity in order to see through these deceptions and these difficulties. It will be necessary for people to do this if humanity is to successfully emerge into the Greater Community and maintain its freedom and its self-determination in an environment of greater influences and greater forces. In this, your world could be overtaken without firing a shot, for violence is considered primitive and crude and is rarely employed in matters such as this.</p>
<p>为了看穿这些欺骗和困难，需要极大的清醒和客观。如果人类要成功地进入大社区，并在更大的影响和力量的环境中保持自由和自决，人们就必须这样做。在这一点上，你们的世界可以在不开一枪的情况下被接管，因为暴力被认为是原始和粗暴的，并且在此类事务中很少使用。</p>
<p>Perhaps you may ask, “Does this mean that there is an invasion of our world?” We must say that the answer to this is “yes,” an invasion of the most subtle kind. If you can entertain these thoughts and consider them seriously, you will be able to see these things for yourself. The evidence of this invasion is everywhere. You can see how human ability is offset by the desire for happiness, peace and security, how people’s vision and ability to know are hampered by influences even within their own cultures. How much greater these influences will be within a Greater Community environment.</p>
<p>也许你会问，“这是否意味着我们的世界正在遭受入侵？”我们必须说，这个问题的答案是“是的”，一种最微妙的入侵。如果你能接受这些想法并认真考虑，你将能够亲自看到这些事情。这种入侵的证据无处不在。你可以看到人类的能力如何被对幸福、和平和安全的渴望所抵消，人们的视野和知道的能力如何被自己文化中的影响所阻碍。在一个大社区的环境中，这些影响将会更为巨大。</p>
<p>This is the difficult message that we must present. This is the message that must be said, the truth that must be spoken, the truth that is vital and cannot wait. It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.</p>
<p>这是我们必须传达的困难讯息。这是必须要说的讯息，是必须说出的真相，是至关重要且不能等待的真相。现在，人们有必要学习更伟大的内识、更伟大的智慧以及更伟大的精神性，这样他们才能找到自己真实的能力，并能够有效地运用它们。</p>
<p>Your freedom is at stake. The future of your world is at stake. It is because of this that we have been sent here to speak for the Allies of Humanity. There are those in the universe who are keeping Knowledge and Wisdom alive and who practice a Greater Community Spirituality. They do not travel all about, casting influence over different worlds. They do not take people against their will. They do not steal your animals and your plants. They do not cast influence over your governments. They do not seek to breed with humanity in order to create a new leadership here. Your allies do not interfere in human affairs. They do not manipulate human destiny. They watch from afar and they send emissaries such as ourselves, at great risk to us, to give counsel and encouragement and to clarify things when that becomes necessary. We, therefore, come in peace with a vital message.</p>
<p>你们的自由正处于危险之中。你们世界的未来正处于危险之中。正因为如此，我们被派遣来到这里代表人类的盟友进行讲话。宇宙中有些种族保持着内识和智慧的活力，他们实践着大社区精神。他们不会四处游历，对不同的世界施加影响。他们不会违背人们的意愿而带走他们。他们不会偷窃你们的动物和植物。他们不会对你们的政府施加影响。他们不会寻求与人类繁衍，以便在这里创造新的领导者。你们的盟友不会干涉人类的事务。他们不会操纵人类的天命。他们在远方观望，并派遣像我们这样的使者，冒着极大的风险，来给予建议和鼓励，并在必要时澄清事情。因此，我们带着至关重要的讯息与和平而来。</p>
<p>Now we must speak of the fourth area in which your visitors seek to establish themselves, and that is through interbreeding. They cannot live in your environment. They need your physical stamina. They need your natural affinity with the world. They need your reproductive abilities. They also want to bond with you because they understand that this creates allegiance. This, in a way, establishes their presence here because the offspring of such a program will have blood relations in the world and yet will have allegiance to the visitors. Perhaps this seems incredible, yet it is so very real.</p>
<p>现在，我们必须谈论来访者试图确立自己存在的第四个领域，那就是通过杂交。他们无法在你们的环境中生存。他们需要你们的身体耐力。他们需要你们与世界的天然亲和力。他们需要你们的生殖能力。它们也想与你们建立纽带，因为他们知道这会产生忠诚。在某种程度上，这确立了他们在这里的存在，因为这种计划的后代将在世界上拥有血缘关系，但同时也会对来访者效忠。也许这听起来难以置信，然而它是如此的真实。</p>
<p>The visitors are not here to take your reproductive abilities away from you. They are here to establish themselves. They want humanity to believe in them and to serve them. They want humanity to work for them. They will promise anything, offer anything and do anything to achieve this goal. Yet though their persuasion is great, their numbers are small. But their influence is growing and their program of interbreeding, which has been underway for several generations, will eventually be effective. There will be human beings of greater intelligence but who do not represent the human family. Such things are possible and have occurred countless times in the Greater Community. You have only to look at your own history to see the impact of cultures and races upon one another and to see how dominating and how influential these interactions can be.</p>
<p>来访者在这里不是为了剥夺你们的生殖能力。他们在这里是为了建立自己。他们希望人类相信他们并为他们服务。他们想让人类为他们工作。为了实现这个目标，他们会承诺一切，提供一切，做一切。然而，尽管他们的说服力很强，但他们的数量却很少。但他们的影响力正在增长，他们已经进行了几代人的杂交计划，最终将取得成效。将会有一些具有更高智能的人类出现，但他们不代表人类大家族。这样的事情是可能的，而且在大社区中已经发生了无数次。你们只需要看看自己的历史，就能看到文化和种族对彼此的影响，以及这些互动如何具有统治力和影响力。</p>
<p>Thus, we bring with us important news, serious news. But you must take heart, for this is not a time for ambivalence. This is not a time to seek escape. This is not a time to concern yourself with your own happiness. This is a time to contribute to the world, to strengthen the human family and to call forth those natural abilities that exist in people—the ability to see, to know and to act in harmony with one another. These abilities can offset the influence that is being cast upon humanity at this time, but these abilities must grow and be shared. It is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>因此，我们带来了重要的消息，严肃的消息。但你们必须振作起来，因为这不是一个矛盾的时间。这不是一个寻求逃避的时间。这不是一个关注你自己幸福的时间。这是一个为世界做出贡献的时间，是强化人类大家庭的时间，并唤起存在于人们身上的那些自然能力——即彼此之间看见、知晓并和谐行动的能力。这些能力可以抵消当前对人类施加的影响，但这些能力必须得到增长并被分享。这是极其重要的。</p>
<p>This is our counsel. It comes with good intentions. Be glad that you have allies in the Greater Community, for allies you will need.</p>
<p>这就是我们的建议，它带着善意而来。庆幸你们在大社区中拥有盟友，因为你们将需要盟友。</p>
<p>You are entering a greater universe, filled with forces and influences that you have not yet learned how to counteract. You are entering a greater panorama of life. And you must prepare for this. Our words are but part of the preparation. A preparation is being sent into the world now. It does not come from us. It comes from the Creator of all life. It comes at just the right time. For this is the time for humanity to become strong and wise. You have the ability to do this. And the events and circumstances of your life create a great need for this.</p>
<p>你们正在进入一个更大的宇宙，充满了你们尚未学会如何对抗的力量和影响。你们正在进入一个更广阔的生命全景。你们必须为此做好准备。我们的话语只是准备工作的一部分。现在有一种准备正被送入世界。它并非来自我们，而是来自所有生命的创造者。它恰好在正确的时间到来。因为现在是人类变得强大且明智的时候。你们有能力做到这一点。而你们生活中的事件和环境也为此创造了巨大的需求。</p>
