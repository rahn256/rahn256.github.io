<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 9, 2011 in Boulder, CO<br>2011年4月9日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mind is weak. Beliefs are easily challenged. Emotions are easily aroused. In the face of travail, one can lose heart and be easily discouraged. This is why people run from the truth, not because what they are facing is untrue, but because they do not have the strength to abide with it.</p>
<p>心灵是脆弱的。信仰容易受到挑战。情绪很容易被激起。面对苦难，人们会失去信心，容易灰心丧气。这就是人们逃避真理的原因，不是因为他们所面对的是不真实的真理，而是因为他们没有力量去坚持真理。</p>
<p>Their plans, their goals, their preferences, their involvements, their previous investments, everything can become so easily challenged in the face of the new world—a world of environmental change and social, political and economic upheaval; a more difficult world where humanity will have to face the damage that it has done to the world and its ability to support humanity. This is an immense challenge, and there are very few people, even amongst the experts, who can really face this.</p>
<p>他们的计划、他们的目标、他们的喜好、他们的参与、他们以前的投资，一切在新世界面前都会变得如此容易受到挑战——一个环境变化和社会、政治、经济动荡的世界；一个人类必须面对自己对世界造成的破坏以及世界支持人类的能力的更加困难的世界。这是一个巨大的挑战，即使在专家当中，能够真正面对这个挑战的人也寥寥无几。</p>
<p>People either go away from this entirely, or they hope that it is not true. They assure themselves that everything will work out fine or that humanity can deal with anything and everything. By that, they mean someone else can deal with it for them.</p>
<p>人们要么完全远离这个问题，要么希望这不是真实的。他们向自己保证，一切都会好起来的，或者人类可以处理任何事情和一切。他们的意思是，其他人可以为他们处理好。</p>
<p>People cannot face reality because they are weak. They are governed by their thoughts, their feelings, their beliefs and the approval of others. So people follow each other around blindly, engage in long and meaningless conversations and indulge themselves in fantasies, hobbies and interests without ever reaching deeper within themselves or one another.</p>
<p>人们不能面对现实，因为他们是弱者。他们被自己的思想、感觉、信仰和他人的认可所支配。因此，人们盲目地跟随对方，进行冗长而无意义的谈话，沉溺于幻想、爱好和兴趣中，却从未深入自己或彼此的内心。</p>
<p>You can see what is real, for God gave you this ability. You can discern, in general terms, what is coming over the horizon because God has given you this ability. You can distinguish your deeper experience from your hopes, wishes and fears because God has given you this ability. It is these deeper abilities that are connected with the deeper Mind within you, the Mind We call Knowledge.</p>
<p>你可以看到什么是真实的，因为上帝赋予你这种能力。你可以大致分辨出地平线上即将出现的事件，因为上帝给了你这种能力。你可以把你更深层次的体验与你的希望、愿望和恐惧区分开来，因为上帝赋予了你这种能力。正是这些更深层次的能力与你内心深处更深层次的心灵相联接，这个心灵我们称之为内识。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not afraid of the world. Knowledge is permanent; it is forever. It was with you before you came here, and it will be with you after you leave. It is not threatened by the world. But it is here on a mission. And for that mission to be fulfilled, it must prepare the rest of you—your mind and your body—for a greater service and participation in the world.</p>
<p>内识不惧怕世界。内识是永久的；它是永恒的。在你来到这里之前，它就和你在一起，在你离开之后，它也会和你在一起。它不会受到世界的威胁。但它在这里是有使命的。为了完成这个使命，它必须为你的其余部分——你的心灵和身体——准备好更伟大的服务以及对世界的参与。</p>
<p>This requires that you face reality, both within yourself and around you out in the world. This, of course, requires a deeper honesty, beyond what you think of at this moment, an honest reckoning of your deeper experience and what Knowledge is really telling you that is happening in the world around you.</p>
<p>这要求你面对现实，无论是在自己的内心还是在你周围的世界（大社区）。当然，这需要一种更深层次的诚实，超越你此刻的想法，诚实地审视你更深层次的体验，以及内识真正告诉你周围世界正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>People look at difficult situations, and they hope for the best and assure themselves that it will be dealt with by someone, somehow, as if they were merely bystanders in life. But the man or woman of Knowledge looks and sees what is coming and sees if people have the courage and the will to prepare.</p>
<p>人们看着困难的情况，他们希望得到最好的结果，并向自己保证，会有人以某种方式处理它，好像他们只是生命中的旁观者。但是，有内识的男人或女人会看到即将发生的事情，看到人们是否有勇气和意志做好准备。</p>
<p>Here you face life clearly, objectively, with greater sobriety, but also with greater strength and compassion. As you learn to take the Steps to Knowledge, the deeper Mind within you, you begin to gain its sense of permanence and strength, certainty and determination. You see this lacking in others, and that is why they live such unfulfilling lives— chasing pleasures and dreams and fantasies, running away from anything that scares them or that challenges their ideas or notions.</p>
<p>在这里，你清楚地、客观地面对生命，有更大的清醒，也有更伟大的力量和同情心。当你学习开展内识进阶时，你会发现自己内心深处的更深层次的心灵，你开始获得它的持久性、力量感，确定性和决心。你看到其他人缺乏这种感觉，这就是为什么他们活得如此不充实——追逐快乐、梦想和幻想，逃避任何让他们害怕或挑战他们想法或观念的内识。</p>
<p>But the calling is for you. The world is a proving ground for you. Regardless of what other people do or do not do, or say or do not say, the challenge is for you. You must understand this, or you will defray your responsibility onto others. “Well,” you say, “what are people going to do? How can I share this with people? And how are people going to change?” That is trying to pass along the responsibility to someone else.</p>
<p>但这是对你的召唤。世界是你的试验场。无论其他人做什么或不做什么，说什么或不说什么，挑战都是为你而设。你必须理解这一点，否则你就会把自己的责任推卸给别人。“好吧，”你说：“人们会怎么做呢？我怎样才能与人们分享这些？人们又该如何改变呢？”这就是试图把责任推卸给别人。</p>
<p>If you think of the general public, you will become discouraged most assuredly. But that is not where your focus needs to be. For you need to prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world. You need to prepare for humanity’s emergence into a Greater Community of life in the universe. You need to prepare for the big events of your life, not just day-to-day affairs.</p>
<p>如果你想到一般公众，你肯定会变得灰心丧气。但这不是你需要关注的地方。因为你需要为即将到来世界的变革巨浪做准备。你需要为人类出现在宇宙中一个生命的大社区做准备。你需要为你生命中的大事件做准备，而不仅仅是日常的事务。</p>
<p>You need to prepare to build the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of your Relationships, the Pillar of your Work and Providership, the Pillar of your Health and the Pillar of your Spiritual Development. Like the four legs of a table, this is what upholds you and determines how great a life you can really live, and how much responsibility and wisdom you can really carry.</p>
<p>你需要准备建立你生命的四大支柱——你的关系支柱，你的工作和供养支柱，你的健康支柱和你的精神发展支柱。就像桌子的四条腿一样，这是支撑你的支柱，决定了你能真正过上多么伟大的生命，以及你能实际承载多少责任和智慧。</p>
<p>To begin to receive the New Revelation, you must have the courage and the will to prepare. This is not an ideology; this is not a belief system; this is not simply a host of ideas that you either like or dislike, agree with or disagree with. To think like this is to think foolishly and to not recognize the power and the meaning of the Revelation and what it calls for from you.</p>
<p>要开始接收新的启示，你必须拥有勇气和意志去准备。这不是一种意识形态；这不是一种信仰体系；这不是简单的一堆你喜欢或不喜欢、赞同或反对的一系列想法。以这种方式思考是愚蠢的，没有认识到启示的力量和意义，以及它对你的召唤。</p>
<p>This has to do with honesty so much and what you tell yourself. Here people do not realize how much their lives are built upon dishonesty and the falsehoods they tell themselves. They are not honest with themselves, really, and therefore that is what they communicate to everyone and the world around them. And they think they are being honest because they are expressing what they think and feel. But they are really perpetrating falsehoods.</p>
<p>这与诚实有很大关系，也与你告诉自己的话语有关。在这里，人们并没有意识到他们的生活在多大程度上建立在不诚实以及他们告诉自己的假话之上。他们对自己不诚实，真的，因此这就是他们传达给每个人和他们周围世界的信息。他们认为自己是诚实的，因为他们在表达自己的想法和感受。但他们实际上是在制造虚假的谎言。</p>
<p>People build relationships upon falsehoods and false assumptions. It happens all the time. People build lives and careers and invest themselves heavily in things that never really had promise to begin with and that do not represent their greater calling for being here. It happens all the time, all around you: a great investment in romance, the great investment in business, the great investment that people make in things that really have very little to do with who they are and why they are here and what they are capable of really giving and comprehending.</p>
<p>人们将关系建立在虚假的谎言和错误的假设之上。这种情况一直在发生。人们建立生活和事业，并将自己大量投资于那些从一开始就没有真正承诺的事情，这些事情并不代表他们在这里的更伟大召唤。这种情况无时无刻不在你周围发生：人们在浪漫关系上投入巨大精力，在事业上投入大量心血，在各种事务上倾注心力——而这些其实与他们是谁，他们为什么在这里，他们能够真正给予和理解什么，都没有多大关系。</p>
<p>The mind is weak. Your ideas and beliefs may be very firm, and you may defend them blindly, but it is still weak. It is a weakness to be fixed in your beliefs. It means you are not only foolish but arrogant on top of it.</p>
<p>心灵是脆弱的。你的想法和信仰可能非常坚定，你可能盲目地捍卫它们，但它仍然是软弱的。固定在你的信仰中是一种弱点。它意味着你不仅是愚蠢的，而且是傲慢的，在这之上。</p>
<p>You do not know who you are, you do not know why you are in the world, you do not know who sent you or what you are really here to do. All the pretense, all the admonitions, all the declarations that people make cannot conceal the fact that they are profoundly unaware of who they are, why they are here and what they are really doing.</p>
<p>你不知道你是谁，你不知道你为什么在这个世界上，你不知道谁派你来的，也不知道你在这里真正要做什么。人们所有的伪装、所有的告诫、所有的声明都无法掩盖这样一个事实，即他们对自己是谁、为什么在这里以及他们真正在做什么都浑然不觉。</p>
<p>People create very demanding lives and take on immense responsibilities before they have any notion of these greater things. And then they feel they must meet these responsibilities, which requires tremendous effort, of course, great suffering and struggle. But they never really have to think about the greater questions because they are too busy meeting their responsibilities.</p>
<p>人们在对这些更伟大的事情有任何概念之前，就创造了非常苛刻的生活，并承担了极大的责任。然后，他们觉得他们必须履行这些责任，这需要极大的努力，当然也有极大的痛苦和挣扎。但是他们从来没有真正思考过更大的问题，因为他们忙于应对各种责任，无暇顾及。</p>
<p>But their responsibilities are not really authentic. They were built without a knowledge and understanding of their deeper nature, their deeper calling and their deeper responsibility to the Source of their lives.</p>
<p>但是，他们的责任并不真正真实。他们是在不知道及不理解自己更深层次的自然、更深层次的召唤以及对生命之源更深层次的责任的情况下建立的。</p>
<p>That is why people are so grave, so unfulfilled, so conflicted, so confused. Oh, sure, they have great responsibilities, and they are being very responsible, and society admires that. But somehow they missed their calling in life, and now they are a slave to their responsibilities and expectations and the expectations of others.</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们如此严肃，如此不满足，如此矛盾，如此困惑的原因。哦，当然，他们有很大的责任，而且他们非常负责任，社会也很钦佩这一点。但不知何故，他们错过了生命的召唤，现在他们成了自己的责任和期望以及他人的期望的奴隶。</p>
<p>And so all the wonder goes out of them. Spontaneity goes out of them. The creativity goes out of them. They are like hollow inside, walking through life, meeting their responsibilities, establishing a position in society perhaps, maybe even leading a nation. But they are hollow inside, empty, missing.</p>
<p>因此，所有的奇迹都从他们身上消失了。他们的自发性消失了。他们的创造性消失了。他们的内心是空虚的，在生命中行走，履行他们的责任，也许在社会上建立一个地位，甚至可能领导一个国家。但他们的内心是空虚的，空的，缺失。</p>
<p>Knowledge for them is so distant, they would have to backtrack to find it. They would have to deeply explore beneath the surface of their mind to find it. But they are so committed on the outside that they dare not risk questioning their priorities and their responsibilities.</p>
<p>内识对他们来说是如此遥远，他们将不得不回溯去寻找它。他们必须深入探索他们的心灵表面之下才能找到它。但他们在表面上是如此坚定，以至于他们不敢冒险质疑他们的优先事项和责任。</p>
<p>So they do not want to know. And they do not want to know anything that would challenge or threaten their plans, goals or activities. And so they are living blindly and are not utilizing the greater Intelligence that God has given them to guide them, to protect them and to prepare them for a greater life.</p>
<p>所以他们不想知道。他们也不想知道任何会挑战或威胁到他们的计划、目标或活动的事情。因此，他们盲目地生活，没有善用上帝赋予他们的更高智能来指导他们，保护他们，为他们准备更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>So they are disassociated from themselves. They are disassociated from God. They are disassociated from the truth. For them, the truth is all about perspective and ideas, which can easily be questioned and dismissed. They are too afraid to deal with the truth that cannot be dismissed, that has nothing to do with perspective. It only has to do with honesty.</p>
<p>所以他们与自己脱节。他们与上帝脱节。他们与真理脱节。对他们来说，真理都是关于观点和想法，很容易被质疑和否定。他们太害怕处理那些不能被否定的真理，那些与观点无关的真理。它只与诚实有关。</p>
<p>You must realize your calling is a calling to prepare, for you are not ready for a greater life. You are not ready to understand and to follow Knowledge within yourself. You do not even know what it is yet. It is still a small and distant intermittent voice within you. You have not come into its proximity enough to understand its greater power and efficacy.</p>
<p>你必须认识到你的召唤是一个准备的召唤，因为你还没有准备好过更伟大的生命。你还没有准备好理解及遵循自己内心深处的内识。你甚至还不知道它是什么。它仍然是你内心深处一个微小而遥远的间歇性的声音。你还没有走近它，不足以理解它更伟大的力量和效力。</p>
<p>You see that it is a thousand times more powerful than your intellect. [Yet] you will think it is a tool of the intellect, a tool to help you get what you want and to avoid difficulty.</p>
<p>你看到它比你的智力强大一千倍。[然而]你会认为它是智力的工具，是帮助你获得你想要的东西和避免困难的工具。</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is there for almost everyone at the outset. They think God is their servant. God is going to give them what they want. God is going to help them with all their problems. God is going to enable them to fulfill their dreams and goals, thinking [this] comes from God.</p>
<p>这种错误理解几乎在每个人一开始就存在。他们认为上帝是他们的仆人。上帝会给他们想要的东西。上帝会帮助他们解决所有的问题。上帝将使他们能够实现他们的梦想和目标，认为[这]来自于上帝。</p>
<p>It takes so very long to unlearn these things and to have the honesty and the courage to question them, to walk around them and look at them objectively, to see if they are really true, if there is any truth there at all, and to break free of the social conditioning that makes you a slave to other people’s approval and expectations.</p>
<p>要忘却这些学习，并拥有诚实与勇气去质疑它们，环绕着它们并客观地审视，看看它们是否真的真实，是否存在任何真理。同时，挣脱那些使你成为他人认可和期望的奴隶的社会条件，这需要很长时间。</p>
<p>That is why God’s first purpose is to unburden you, for you are burdened with the unnecessary. You are struggling with things that can never be and have little promise. You are a slave to your culture, to your family, to your religion, to ideas and beliefs that are not founded upon Knowledge. And that which is founded upon Knowledge, you cannot easily discern.</p>
<p>这就是为什么上帝的第一个目的是解除你的负担，因为你被不必要的负担所连累。你正在为那些永远不可能实现的事情而挣扎，而且没有什么希望。你是你的文化、你的家庭、你的宗教的奴隶，是没有建立在内识之上的想法和信仰的奴隶。而建立在内识基础之上的关系，你又很难轻易辨别。</p>
<p>It is like the needle in the haystack, as people say. Well, you have to remove a lot of hay to find that needle. That is what your preparation is largely about—to remove that which is false, that which is unreal, that which you are bound to that you desire, that you do not really need. It is not necessary, and therefore it is a distraction and an obsession for you.</p>
<p>它就像人们所说的大海捞针。好吧，你必须清除很多干草才能找到那根针。这就是你的准备工作的主要内容——去除那些虚假的东西，那些不真实的东西，那些你所依赖但实际上并不需要的东西。这些并不是必要的，因此对你来说，它们只是一种干扰和执迷。</p>
<p>People fall in love with other people based upon images and personality and seductions—people that could never take the greater journey with them, not in a million years. And yet, oh, they are so devoted they give their life away. They are obsessed—personality obsession. They are obsessed, and they call that love. As if love were some kind of drug you become addicted to, and then you have to go through withdrawal, which is immensely difficult. There is substance addiction and personality addiction. It is not love. It is obsession.</p>
<p>人们在形象、人格和诱惑的基础上爱上他人——这些人永远不可能和他们一起踏上更伟大的旅程，一百万年也不会。然而，他们是如此执着，以至于愿意奉献出自己的生命。他们迷恋于人格，他们把这种痴迷称之为爱。仿佛爱是一种让人上瘾的毒品，之后你必须经历艰难的戒断期。无论是物质依赖还是人格依赖。它都不是爱。它是痴迷。</p>
<p>Knowledge will guide you to the people, the individuals, who really have promise for your life, who really have the possibility of becoming significant and meaningful relationships for you. We say “possibility” because they too have to prepare, for no one is really ready for the greater realities of life. That is like asking children to be ready to go out and work in the world like their parents. They are not ready for that.</p>
<p>内识会引导你找到那些真正对你的生命有承诺的人，那些真正有可能成为你的重要及有意义关系的人。我们说“可能性”是因为他们也必须做好准备，因为没有人真正准备好面对生命的更伟大现实。这就好比要求孩子们做好准备，像他们的父母一样去外面的世界工作。他们还没有准备好。</p>
<p>In like manner, you are not ready to live a life of a greater purpose. And so the preparation becomes the emphasis; your honesty becomes the emphasis; your patience and your determination become the emphasis.</p>
<p>同样地，你也没有准备好过一个有更伟大目的的生命。因此，准备成为重点；你的诚实成为重点；你的耐心和决心成为重点。</p>
<p>For, you see, only Knowledge brings you to Knowledge. All your other reasons—wealth, pleasure, peace, love, romance—all these things have to be set aside as you go along. You cannot take them up the mountain with you. They are far too heavy and unnecessary.</p>
<p>因为，你看，只有内识才能引领你走向你识。你所有其他的理由——财富、快乐、和平、爱、浪漫——所有这些理由都必须在你前进的过程中被搁置。你不能把它们带上山。它们太沉重了，而且没有必要。</p>
<p>So the student is in a process of undoing things they have already set in motion and breaking free of false expectations, goals, plans and desires. They do not become ascetic here; they simply become honest—basic, simple, deep honesty. It is not a lifestyle. You are not giving up all pleasures; you are not withdrawing from the world; you are not living a life of extreme abstinence. You are just becoming honest, to the point where you are no longer lying to yourself and to other people, and to the point where you can see your tendency to do this and can correct it and objectify it within your own experience.</p>
<p>因此，学生处于一个撤销他们已经设定的事情的过程中，挣脱错误的期望、目标、计划和渴望。他们在这里并没有成为禁欲主义者；他们只是变得诚实——基本的、简单的、深刻的诚实。它不是一种生活方式。你不是放弃所有的快乐；你不是退出世界；你不是过一种极端禁欲的生命。你只是变得诚实，达到不再对自己和他人撒谎的程度，达到你能看到自己有这种倾向的程度，并能在自己的经历中纠正它，使之客观化。</p>
<p>To prepare requires courage. You must face things you have not faced before. You must consider things you have not considered before. You must question your beliefs and your assumptions, and the beliefs and assumptions of your culture, your family and even your religion, if necessary.</p>
<p>做准备需要勇气。你必须面对你以前没有面对过的事情。你必须考虑你以前没有考虑过的事情。你必须质疑你的信仰和假设，以及你的文化、你的家庭、甚至你的宗教信仰和假设，如果有必要。</p>
<p>You find this courage because it is coming from a deeper place within you—beneath the surface of the mind; beneath the turbulent, confused and chaotic surface of your mind into a deeper place where there is certainty, wisdom and Knowledge.</p>
<p>你之所以能找到这种勇气，是因为它来自你内心深处一个更深层次的地方——在心灵的表面之下；在你心灵的动荡、困惑和混乱的表面之下，进入一个更深层次的地方，这里有确定性、智慧和内识。</p>
<p>People are so frightened and so driven and so compulsive, they cannot be still for five seconds. They close their eyes to begin meditation, and their mind is like a wild animal—going everywhere, like all the channels of your television running at once, going from here and there and everywhere.</p>
<p>人们是如此害怕，如此被驱使，如此被强迫，他们无法静下心来五秒钟。他们闭上眼睛开始冥想，而他们的心灵就像一只野兽——到处乱跑，它就像你电视机上的所有频道同时播放并来回切换，无处不在。</p>
<p>You must step back from this and not identify with this. It is just the mind, trying to process all of its impressions, information and problem solving—either reasonably and logically or in fantastic ways, as if you are in a dream.</p>
<p>你必须从这里退后，不要与心灵认同。它只是心灵在试图处理所有的印象、信息和问题的解决——要么是合理的、有逻辑的，要么是以奇幻的方式，就像你身处于梦中一样。</p>
<p>The courage comes from recognizing and feeling a deeper need within yourself. It is really responding to Knowledge, perhaps very faintly and intermittently at first, but Knowledge is calling you to respond.</p>
<p>勇气来自于承认和感受自己内心深处一种更深层次的需求。这确实是对内识的回应，也许一开始是非常微弱的、断断续续的，但内识在召唤你去回应。</p>
<p>This is how God speaks to you, you see. The clouds do not part and a great voice speaks, thundering through the mountains, calling your name. No, even for the saints and the great Messengers, the process is the same. Everything else is just storytelling, to induce belief and submission.</p>
<p>你看，这就是上帝对你说话的方式。云彩不会分开，一个伟大的声音不会在山间轰鸣，召唤你的名字。不，即使是圣人和伟大的信使，其过程也是一样的。其他一切都只是在讲故事，诱导人们的信仰和服从。</p>
<p>You feel the deeper need to respond. You feel the need to understand where you need to go in life. You do not want your life to end up like all the people you are seeing around you. You do not want to become a slave to your mind or to your culture. You do not want to have empty relationships. You do not want to work, slavishly, to build wealth.</p>
<p>你感受到有一种更深层次的需求需要回应。你觉得需要理解自己在生命中应该去的地方。你不希望你的生命像你周围所有的人一样结束。你不想成为你的心灵或文化的奴隶。你不想拥有空洞的关系。你不想像奴隶一样工作来积累财富。</p>
<p>So you have to really look at your life. What is available to you? What limits you, on the outside? And then, even more importantly, what limits you on the inside? Which is nothing more than your beliefs, assumptions, desires and fears—all those things that are vaporous and have little substance in reality.</p>
<p>所以你必须真正审视自己的生命。对你来说，什么是可用的？外部有什么限制你？然后，更重要的是，什么限制了你的内心？这些限制无非是你的信念、假设、欲望和恐惧——所有这些东西都是虚无缥缈的，在现实中几乎没有实质内容。</p>
<p>The moon still rises, the sun still shines, the seasons pass, the grasses grow, the birds fly, the fishes swim—so what difference do your thoughts make, except to either cloud or clarify your perception?</p>
<p>月亮依旧升起，太阳依旧照耀，四季交替，草木生长，鸟儿飞翔，鱼儿游动——因此，除了模糊或澄清你的感知，你的想法有什么区别呢？</p>
<p>It is not a question of creating your own reality, for people use that to build, they think, a better fantasy to replace the miserable one they are living in now. But fantasies are miserable if you attempt to live them because they are not in accordance with reality or Knowledge within yourself. And the more you invest, the more hazardous your life becomes and the more you are afraid of the world. You are afraid of change; you are afraid of loss; you are afraid of honesty.</p>
<p>这不是一个创造你自己现实的问题，因为人们利用这个想法来构建他们认为的更美好的幻想，以取代他们目前所生活的悲惨现实。但是，如果你试图生活在幻想中，就会很悲惨，因为这些幻想并不符合现实或你内心深处的内识。而你投入的越多，你的生命就变得越危险，你对这个世界的恐惧也就越大。你害怕改变；你害怕损失；你害怕诚实。</p>
<p>God asks you to be honest. From this, you can begin to discern a greater pathway for yourself, a greater calling in your life, a greater association beyond the visible realm and a new foundation for participating with others in ways that are marvelous and productive.</p>
<p>上帝要求你诚实。从这一点上，你可以开始为自己辨别一条更伟大的道路，你生命中更伟大的召唤，超越可见领域的更伟大关联，以及以奇妙和富有成效的方式与他人共同参与的新基础。</p>
<p>The will to prepare and courage…Courage is taking on difficult things without any kind of certain outcome. It is not following the easy path, where everything is laid out for you: You go and work in your father’s business, so you never have to think about what you are really here to do. You have children before you are ready so that they will determine the responsibilities of your life. You get married before you have any clue of what you are doing and the direction you need to go. Therefore, your marriage determines your life and ends up looking like everyone else.</p>
<p>准备的意志和勇气……勇气是在没有任何确定结果的情况下承担困难的事情。它不是遵循简单的道路，在那里一切都为你安排妥当。你去父亲的公司工作，这样你就不必思考自己真正要做的事情。你在尚未准备好的时候就有了孩子，这样他们就会决定你生命中的责任。在你对自己的工作和需要的方向有任何线索之前，你就结婚了。因此，你的婚姻决定了你的人生，最后看起来和其他人一样。</p>
<p>The world is the way it is based upon how many people are responding to their greater calling and purpose of their life. If the percentage is tiny, well, the world is always in a state of travail and conflict, at the edge of conflict, at the edge of breakdown.</p>
<p>世界是基于有多少人响应他们更伟大的召唤及他们的生命目的而形成的。如果这个比例微乎其微，那么，这个世界总是处于困苦和冲突的状态，处于冲突的边缘，处于崩溃的边缘。</p>
<p>People become slavish, like herds of animals—driven into war, driven into needless consumption, driven into political persuasions, driven into religious beliefs when they have no real sense of who they are or what they are doing.</p>
<p>人们变得奴颜婢膝，就像成群的动物，被驱赶到战争中，被驱赶到无谓的消费中，被驱赶到政治主张中，被驱赶到宗教信仰中，而他们对自己是谁或自己在做什么并没有真情实感。</p>
<p>People live at the surface of the mind, which is like the surface of the ocean—turbulent, swept by the winds of the world, one day calm, the next day stirred up, even violent. If you were to look at the surface from the side of a ship, the ocean would make no sense. You could not discern its greater movements. You could not discern that beneath the surface, waters are moving like a conveyor belt all over the world.</p>
<p>人们生活在心灵的表面，就像海洋的表面——动荡不安，被世间的风吹拂，一天风平浪静，第二天却波涛汹涌，甚至狂暴。如果你从船的一侧看向海面，海洋将毫无意义，你无法辨别它更深层的运动。你也无法察觉，在海面之下，水流正像传送带一样向世界各地流动。</p>
<p>You would not understand the life that lives within that ocean. You would not understand how organized, though complex, the system of the oceans and the climate and the Earth really are. You would just see turbulence and try to adapt to that, like those sailing a ship. They have learned to understand currents and patterns of wind over time, so they have a greater understanding because they had the need and the courage to prepare for that.</p>
<p>你不会理解生活在这片海洋中的生命。你不会理解海洋、气候和地球系统的有序性，尽管它们复杂无比。你只会看到海面的波动，并试图去适应它，就像那些航海者一样。他们经过时间的积累学会了理解水流和风的模式，因此拥有了更深入的理解，因为他们有这样的需求，并且具备准备的勇气。</p>
<p>The winds of the world are sweeping your mind around—drawing you in, upsetting you, overwhelming you, delighting you, intriguing you, terrifying you. How can you ever find yourself here? How can you ever discern the greater direction of your life here?</p>
<p>世间的风正吹动着你的心灵——将你卷入其中，让你不安，让你不知所措，让你高兴，让你好奇，让你害怕。在这里，你如何才能找到你自己？在这里，你如何才能辨识出生命的更伟大方向？</p>
<p>You must withdraw from these things, to a great degree, to have any possibility of coming into proximity to Knowledge within yourself. So you will feel the natural inclination to withdraw from social activities, from the media, from many things, for a period of time so that you can have the opportunity to discern your deeper experience.</p>
<p>你必须在很大程度上从这些事物中抽离出来，才有可能接近你自己内心深处的内识。因此，你会自然地倾向于暂时远离社交活动、媒体以及许多其他事物，以便你能有机会去觉察自己更深层次的体验。</p>
<p>The Lord of the universes has provided the Steps to Knowledge, a powerful preparation that you could not provide for yourself. You follow this, and as you do so, that which is true becomes stronger, and that which is false becomes weaker. As you follow this, you become more circumspect about your life and your decisions, more careful with your time and your involvements with others, more discerning of the world around you.</p>
<p>宇宙之主已经提供了内识进阶，这是你无法为自己提供的强大准备。你遵循这个准备，当你这样做时，真实的内识会变得更强，而虚假的东西会变得更弱。在你遵循这些步骤的过程中，你会对自己的生命和决定更加谨慎，对自己的时间和与他人的交往更加小心，并对你周围的世界更有辨别力。</p>
<p>As the mind becomes more quiet, you begin to perceive things you did not see before. You hear things you did not hear before. You begin to respond increasingly to Knowledge within yourself and to Knowledge within others. And you see how you can tell the difference between Knowledge and everything else.</p>
<p>随着心灵变得更加安静，你会开始感知到以前看不到的事物。你会听到以前听不到的声音。你开始越来越多地回应自己和他人内心深处的内识。并且你能分辨出什么是内识，什么不是。</p>
<p>The Angelic Presence watches to see who can respond to the calling and then see if they have the will to prepare and the courage to take the Steps to Knowledge, to climb this mountain, a mountain that they cannot discern and do not understand; [to see] who can take a real journey in life, a substantial and powerful journey. The Angelic Presence watches to see who can respond to Knowledge and who can prepare.</p>
<p>天使的存在正在观察，看谁能响应召唤，然后看他们是否有意志准备与勇气开展内识的进阶，去攀登这座大山，去攀登这座他们无法辨别、无法理解的高山；看谁能踏上生命真正的旅程，一段充实而有力的旅程。天使的存在观察着谁能对内识做出回应，谁能做好准备。</p>
<p>The preparation then becomes the proving ground. It does not matter if you have a great destiny to do something very significant in the world if you cannot prepare for that. And the preparation requires more unlearning than learning—breaking free, going through periods of profound confusion and uncertainty as you release your old ideas and approach a greater understanding.</p>
<p>这样，准备工作就成了试验场。如果你不能为此做好准备，那么即使你命中注定要在这个世界上做一些非常重要的事情，也无济于事。在准备过程中，你需要更多的不学习，而不是学习——挣脱束缚，经历深刻的困惑和不确定期，释放旧的想法，接近一种更伟大的理解。</p>
<p>Like the man on the trapeze—he must let go of one bar to reach the next. And so those intervals can be very empty for people. You are not who you used to be, but you have not yet become what you are meant to become, so you go through periods of emptiness and uncertainty. But that is natural and part of learning. That is an integral part of preparation.</p>
<p>就像在空中飞人一样，他必须松开这一杆才能到达下一杆。因此，这些间隔对人们来说可能是非常空虚的。你不再是过去的你，但你还没有成为你要成为的人，所以你会经历空虚和不确定的时期。但这是自然的，是学习的一部分。这是准备工作不可或缺的一部分。</p>
<p>What carries you through this is Knowledge, and your faith in Knowledge, and the evidence of Knowledge that you are beginning to live and have acquired thus far, and the evidence of Knowledge in the lives of people who inspire you.</p>
<p>支撑你度过这个阶段的是内识及你对内识的信仰，以及你开始体验并至今获得的内识证据，还有那些在你生活中激励你的人们所展现的内识。</p>
<p>You must go through this preparation. You are not yet where you need to be within yourself or even within your position in life yet to really comprehend and then respond to a greater calling.</p>
<p>你必须经历这种准备。你还没有达到你自己需要的位置，甚至还没有达到自己在生命中的位置，因此无法真正理解并响应更伟大的召唤。</p>
<p>So the calling is to prepare, and to prepare you must have deeper courage. And that deeper courage comes from your honesty. You are developing a deeper honesty. And the motivation for all of these things comes from Knowledge.</p>
<p>所以召唤是准备，为了准备，你必须有更深层次的勇气。而这种更深层次的勇气来自于你的诚实。你正在发展一种更深层次的诚实。而所有这些事情的动力来自于内识。</p>
<p>Knowledge will bring you to Knowledge. Knowledge will carry you through periods of uncertainty. Knowledge is permanent. Your experience of it may vary as your proximity to it varies, but it is constant. It is not confused. It is the master; you are the student.</p>
<p>内识将带你走向内识。内识将带你度过不确定的时期。内识是永久的。你对它的体验可能会随着你对它的接近程度的变化而改变，但它是恒久不变的。它不会被混淆。它是大师；你是学生。</p>
<p>But here you also need other teachers, students who are more advanced than you in learning and applying the New Revelation. You will need, if you can, to learn of the Messenger himself, who is in the world now. It is a great blessing that he is here and that you can learn from him. For when he is gone, then the Messenger will be gone.</p>
<p>但在这里，你也需要其他老师，那些在学习和应用新启示方面比你更先进的学生。如果可以的话，你将需要学习信使本人，他现在就在这个世界上。他在这里，你可以向他学习，这是一个伟大的祝福。因为当他离开时，信使也会离开。</p>
<p>People will have to then rely upon their comprehension, which is a very dangerous thing when people are not really well prepared. Mistakes can be made easily, and the Message can be altered, confused and diluted. Others can come to assume positions of power and leadership who were never really authorized to do this by the Greater Powers.</p>
<p>人们将不得不依靠他们的理解力，而当人们没有真正做好充分准备时，这是一件非常危险的事情。人们很容易犯错误，讯息也会被篡改、混淆和稀释。其他人可能会来担任权力和领导职位，而这些人从未被更伟大的力量真正授权这样做。</p>
<p>To live at the time of Revelation, to live at the time of the Messenger, is immensely important. You will not have a personal relationship with him—he does not have time to have personal relationships with hundreds and thousands of people—but you can learn from him. Be grateful that you are living at a time when he is here with you. He is an older man; he is not going to be here forever.</p>
<p>生活在启示的时期，生活在信使的时期，是极其重要的。你不会与他有个人关系，他没有时间与成百上千的人有个人关系，但你可以从他身上学习。要感谢你生活在一个与他同行的时期。他已经是一位年长的老人；他不会永远呆在这里。</p>
<p>You need powerful influences on the outside and on the inside to navigate the confusion, the complexity and even the deceptions that exist within you, and certainly to navigate a changing and increasingly unstable world.</p>
<p>你需要来自外部和内部的强大影响，来驾驭存在于你内心的混乱、复杂甚至是欺骗，当然也需要驾驭这个不断变化、日益不稳定的世界。</p>
<p>You need the power of Knowledge. You also need strong companions. And you need powerful examples from others to inspire you and to help you see if you are making a mistake in your comprehension or application.</p>
<p>你需要内识的力量。你也需要强大的同伴。而且你需要别人强有力的例子来激励你，帮助你看清自己在理解或应用中是否犯了错误。</p>
<p>Some people come to the New Revelation and just want to be blessed by it, and think that from now on the blessing will just take care of everything for them. They want to be on spiritual welfare, thinking God is just going to provide and provide and provide, and they just have to be accepting of the miracles they think will be coming to them. But, you see, this is dishonest.</p>
<p>有些人来到新启示面前，只想得到它的祝福，并认为从现在开始，祝福将为他们解决一切问题。他们想得到精神上的福利，认为上帝会不断地提供、提供、再提供，他们只需接受他们认为会出现在他们身上的奇迹。但是，你看，这是不诚实的。</p>
<p>To be in a genuine relationship requires real participation. It requires preparation. It requires effort. It requires an investment of time and energy. It involves change and adaptation.</p>
<p>要建立真正的关系，需要真正的参与。它需要准备。它需要付出努力。它需要时间和精力的投资。它涉及改变和适应。</p>
<p>You cannot just marry someone and think that they are just going to do what you think they should do, and you are not going to do anything for them; you are not going to have to change to be with them. People actually get married with this attitude. It is amazing. It is so profoundly ignorant, but it is sadly true.</p>
<p>你不能随便与人结婚，然后认为他们就会按照你认为他们应该做的方式去做，而你自己却不愿意为他们付出；你也不愿意为了和他们在一起而改变。人们实际上是以这种态度结婚的，它是不可思议的。它是如此深刻的无知，但却又是可悲的事实。</p>
<p>The calling is to respond. Then the calling is to prepare. And the preparation is significant. But even during the preparation, you will have the opportunity to contribute to others. That contribution will come out of whatever advancement you can make in your preparation. Even your demonstration of responding to Knowledge is a powerful teaching to others. Even your unwillingness to make certain compromises with yourself and others is a powerful demonstration.</p>
<p>召唤是为了回应。然后，召唤是准备。而准备工作是至关重要的。但即使在准备期间，你也会有机会为他人做出贡献。这种贡献将来自于你在准备过程中所能取得的任何进步。甚至你对内识回应的示范也是对他人的有力教导。即使你不愿意对自己和他人做出某些妥协，也是一个强有力的示范。</p>
<p>Here you teach, automatically, as you learn, if your learning is authentic. In fact, you teach anyway because you are always demonstrating what you value and what you believe in. So as you value something far greater and more significant, then that becomes part of your demonstration to others.</p>
<p>在这里，如果你的学习是自然而然地，你就会自动地教导，因为你在学习。事实上，无论如何，你都会教导，因为你总是在展示你的价值和你所相信的。因此，当你重视更伟大、更有意义的内识时，它便成为你向他人展示的一部分。</p>
<p>Here your relationships change. Old relationships can fall away, for they cannot take the journey with you, and new relations appear on the horizon.</p>
<p>在这里，你的关系发生了改变。旧的关系可能会消失，因为它们不能和你一起旅行，而新的关系出现在地平线上。</p>
<p>This is part of the miracle of your life, the miracle of Knowledge—the miracle of God’s Plan of redemption and restoration going on behind the scenes, going on beyond the realm of human activity, speculation, deception and belief.</p>
<p>这是你生命中奇迹的一部分，内识的奇迹——上帝的救赎和恢复计划在幕后进行的奇迹，在人类活动、猜测、欺骗和信仰的领域之外进行。</p>
<p>You have come to the world to assume a greater responsibility, a greater purpose, to give something specific to certain people in certain situations. You have no idea what this is, and so you must prepare. Knowledge must prepare you, and Knowledge must reveal where you must go and what you must do to achieve these things.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界是为了承担一个更伟大的责任，一个更伟大的目的，在特定情况下给特定的人提供特定的礼物。你不知道这是什么，所以你必须做好准备。内识必须让你做好准备，内识必须揭示你必须去哪里，你必须做什么来实现这些事情。</p>
<p>You have to govern your own mind and keep it supporting you. You have to exert authority over your thoughts and your behaviors. But you cannot determine the greater purpose of your life. For that you must follow a greater power, and the greater power is within Knowledge within you and within the Revelation itself.</p>
<p>你必须管理你自己的心灵，让它支持你。你必须对你的思想和行为施加权威。但你不能决定你生命的更伟大目的。为此，你必须遵循一种更伟大的力量，而这种力量存在于你内心深处的内识以及启示本身之中。</p>
<p>It is within all the world’s great religions if it can be discerned. But the world’s great religions have become so overlaid with conventions and beliefs and assumptions and associations that you would need a very skillful teacher to pass through all of this, to reach the essence of what these religions really mean and are indicating. They are all pathways to Knowledge, you see. But this is not really evident from the surface.</p>
<p>如果可以分辨的话，它就在世界所有的伟大宗教之中。但是，世界上的伟大宗教已经变得如此被惯例、信仰、假设和联想所覆盖，以至于你需要一位非常熟练的老师来穿过这一切，以达到这些宗教真正意义和指示的精髓。你看，它们都是通往内识的道路。但从表面上看，这并不明显。</p>
<p>This is part of the reason that the New Revelation is here and that We have come again, now, to speak to you as well as to the Messenger. We speak to you through the Revelation, and Our message for you is very great. And the time and the requirement is very great. And the change upon the world is very great.</p>
<p>这就是新启示在这里的部分原因，我们再次来到这里，与你和信使交谈。我们通过启示与你对话，我们的讯息对你而言是非常伟大的。而且时间和要求都非常苛刻。世界上的变化同样是极其巨大的。</p>
<p>It is time to become strong and courageous, honest, compassionate and determined. Then you are really being alive and not like a walking dead person. Then you are really creative. Then your mind is connected to Knowledge, and the Separation within you is beginning to end. Then your life becomes a demonstration of God’s Presence and Power in the world, not only by great things you might do, but by your simple activities and just by the way you are, what you do and what you do not do.</p>
<p>现在是时候变得强大和勇敢、诚实、富有同情心和决心。这样，你才能真正活着，而不是像一个行尸走肉的人。这样，你才真正具有创造力。然后，你的心灵与内识相连，你内心的分离开始结束。这样，你的生命就会在世界上展示上帝的存在和力量，不仅仅是通过你所做的伟大事情，还有你的简单活动，以及你的为人处世、所做所不做。</p>
<p>God saves you from the inside out. God reclaims the separated through Knowledge. Nations and worlds become stronger, more stable, more creative based upon how much Knowledge is being expressed and demonstrated within their own populations.</p>
<p>上帝从里到外拯救你。上帝通过内识找回分离的人。国家和世界变得更加强大、更加稳定、更加具有创造力，这取决于有多少内识在他们的人口中被表达和展示。</p>
<p>This is true here and throughout the universe. It is all beyond human comprehension and the realm and the reach of the intellect. But your intellect plays its part. It is a critical tool of communication and navigation in the world. But it must have a greater guide and power, or it tries to become God itself, with tragic consequences.</p>
<p>这里如此，整个宇宙也是如此。这一切都超出了人类的理解力，也超出了智力的领域和范围。但你的智力发挥着它的作用。它是在这个世界上沟通和导航的重要工具。但它必须有更伟大的指导和更伟大的力量，否则它就会试图成为上帝本身，从而带来悲剧性的后果。</p>
<p>You have been called. Now you must prepare. The preparation is within you, and it is being provided by the Lord of the universe. Now you must find the courage to take the Steps to Knowledge, and with this courage, the patience, and the perseverance, and the discretion and the discernment as over time you learn to discern what is true from what is false, what is really good from what only looks good.</p>
<p>你已经被召唤。现在你必须准备。准备就在你的内心深处，而且是由宇宙之主提供。现在你必须找到勇气，开展内识的进阶，有了这种勇气，就有了耐心，有了毅力，有了谨慎和辨别力，随着时间的推移，你要学会辨别什么是真实，什么是虚假，什么是真正的好，什么只是看起来好。</p>
<p>This is the journey. It is the most natural and essential journey in life. And you are blessed to learn of it and its gifts to you.</p>
<p>这就是旅程。它是生命中最自然和最重要的旅程。你是被祝福的，可以学习启示及其所带给你的礼物。</p>
