You will need this understanding now, for the world is changing and your future and destiny is before you. It is our privilege to share this greater wisdom with you. We can only hope that it can be comprehended correctly and applied correctly, for such things can be misconstrued and grave error can arise from them. Let us begin now.</p>
<p>我们很高兴能够回应这些问题，因为我们知道它们在帮助你们获得更大的理解方面非常重要。你们现在需要这种理解，因为世界正在改变，你们的未来和天命就在你们的面前。能够与你们分享这种更伟大的智慧是我们的荣幸。我们只能希望这些智慧能够被正确地理解和运用，因为这些智慧若被错误解释，可能会引发严重的错误。让我们现在开始吧。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How are you different from those forces who are intervening in the world today?”</p>
<p>“你们与那些干预当今世界的势力有什么不同？”</p>
<p>We represent those free races in your region of space who still value individual freedom and who have stayed out of the larger networks of trade and commerce conducted by nations that, though powerful, do not honor individual freedom and do not recognize the power of Knowledge in the individual as a blessing and as a great resource.</p>
<p>我们代表的是你们所在空间区域内那些仍然珍视个人自由的自由种族，并且不参与由国家所进行的更大规模的贸易和商业网络，这些国家虽然强大，但不尊重个人的自由，也不承认内识在个人中的力量是一种祝福和伟大的资源。</p>
<p>We come here not to intervene but to share our wisdom and perspective that humanity will need now to proceed with greater certainty and greater strength and understanding in its engagement with life in the universe. You cannot give yourself this education. It cannot be taught in your universities or centers of learning. Therefore, it must be given to you by others who value your presence in the universe and do not want to see you fall under the persuasion and domination of foreign powers.</p>
<p>我们来到这里并不是为了干预，而是为了分享我们的智慧和视角，人类现在需要以更大的确定性和更大的力量和理解来参与宇宙中的生命。你们无法自行给予自己这种教育，也无法在你们的大学或学习中心中获得它。因此，这种教育必须由那些珍视你们在宇宙中的存在、不愿看到你们沦为外来势力的说服和统治之下的种族给予你们。</p>
<p>Therefore, our intent is entirely different from that of the Intervention. Our societies are entirely different. Our focus and our wisdom are entirely different. If you can understand that humanity must unite itself and gather its own strength and wisdom without foreign control, then you will understand why we are not intervening in the world, but instead only offering our wisdom, perspective and guidance for you to use or not to use, as you so choose.</p>
<p>因此，我们的意图与干预者的意图是完全不同的。我们的社会是完全不同的。我们的关注和智慧也是完全不同的。如果你能理解人类必须团结起来，聚集自身的力量和智慧，而不受外部控制，那你就会理解我们为什么不干预这个世界，而是仅仅提供我们的智慧、视角和指导供你们选择使用或不使用，完全由你们决定。</p>
<hr>
<p>“What does the Intervention want here on Earth?”</p>
<p>“干预组织想要在地球上得到什么？”</p>
<p>The Intervention seeks to control this world and the world’s peoples. It does this not only to meet its own goals of wealth and resource acquisition, but to serve larger powers who secretly will use the Intervention to gain control of the world. These larger powers would not dare to enter the world as the Intervention is doing now, but they will use these more unscrupulous forces to achieve their own goals of influence and acquisition.</p>
<p>干预试图控制这个世界和世界上的人民。它这样做不仅是为了实现自己的财富和资源获取的目标，而且也是为了服务于那些暗中利用干预行动获得世界控制权的大国。这些大国不敢像干预组织现在这样直接进入世界，但它们会借助这些不择手段的势力来实现自身的影响和收购目标。</p>
<p>The Intervention wants a compliant humanity. It does not want a rebellious humanity, for it could not manage that. The Intervention wants humanity to work agreeably—believing in its goals, principles and promises. These, of course, are false and deceiving, and it would be the gravest of errors if humanity were to follow these mandates.</p>
<p>干预组织想要一个顺从的人类。它不想要一个叛逆的人类，因为它无法管理这样的局面。干预组织希望人类能够顺从地工作——相信它的目标、原则和承诺。当然，这些都是虚假的和欺骗性的，如果人类遵循这些指令，将犯下最严重的错误。</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that you now have competition from the universe—competition for the value and the resources of this world, its strategic position and those things that are secretly hidden here beyond human awareness, which are of immense value to those races in the universe who are aware of them.</p>
<p>因此，你要理解，你们现在面临着来自宇宙的竞争——对这个世界的价值和资源的竞争，对它的战略地位的竞争，以及对那些在人类觉知之外秘密隐藏在这里的宝藏的竞争，而这些宝藏对于宇宙中那些察觉到它们的种族来说具有极大的价值。</p>
<p>From this point forward, you will have to defend your world from intervention and from persuasion, which can be very powerful and very influential. These powers have been exerted in our worlds to the great detriment of our peoples, and we had to fight and struggle to regain our freedom and to ward off these influences and to keep them out of our districts. It is the price in the universe where freedom is rare.</p>
<p>从这一点上看，你们将不得不捍卫自己的世界不受干预，不受说服，因为这些干预和说服可以非常强大，非常有影响力。在我们的世界里，这些大国的存在对我们的人民造成了极大的伤害，我们不得不奋力抗争，才重新获得自由，并成功抵御这些影响，并将它们排除在我们的地区之外。这就是宇宙中自由稀少的代价。</p>
<p>Freedom requires vigilance. Freedom requires great care and great discernment. Humanity must develop these skills and these qualities if it is to survive in a diverse and influential universe, if it is to remain free and self-determined amidst the presence of other powerful forces.</p>
<p>自由需要警惕。自由需要伟大的关怀和伟大的辨别力。人类必须发展这些技能和品质，如果人类要在一个多样化和有影响力的宇宙中生存，如果它要在其他强大势力的存在中保持自由和自决。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Are any of the visitors beneficial to humanity?”</p>
<p>“有任何来访者对人类有益吗？”</p>
<p>No one who is visiting your world now or in recent times is beneficial to humanity. They all represent competing forces vying for power and influence here. They are all part of the Intervention, which is made up of more than one race. If you could understand your situation more thoroughly, then you would recognize that intervention in any form is detrimental to humanity and that such intervention is being carried out for self-interest to gain control and to gain domination.</p>
<p>目前或近期访问你们世界的任何种族都对人类没有益处。他们全都代表着竞争势力，争夺这里的权力和影响力。他们都是干预的一部分，而干预组织由多个种族组成。如果你能够更彻底地理解你们的处境，那你就会认识到，任何形式的干预对人类都是有害的，这种干预只是为了自身的利益而进行的，以实现控制和统治。</p>
<p>No true ally of humanity would be in the world trying to manipulate human awareness, trying to control human behavior, trying to steer human destiny to its own ends.</p>
<p>没有哪个人类的真实盟友会在这个世界上试图操纵人类的觉知，试图控制人类的行为，试图引导人类的天命以实现自身的目的。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are facing an unequivocal situation. You do not have the burden of trying to tell friend from foe amongst those who are intervening in the world. That would be very difficult for you to do, given the powers of persuasion that are being placed upon humanity at this time.</p>
<p>因此，你们所面临的局势是明确无误的。你们不必区分干预世界的种族中谁是朋友、谁是敌人而进行烦恼。考虑到此时大国置于人类身上的说服力，这对你们来说将是极其困难的事情。</p>
<p>You have the benefit of facing a clear and unequivocal situation. Those who are visiting your world are here to manipulate and to deceive. They feel that their goals are correct and that they more than you could rule humanity beneficially. But that is according to their values, which does not esteem in any way individual freedom, nor does it value the greater qualities of the human nature and the achievements of humanity.</p>
<p>你们正在面对的是一个清晰而明确的局面，这对你们是有益处的。那些正在访问你们世界的势力在这里是为了操纵和欺骗。他们觉得他们的目标是正确的，并且认为自己比你们更适合有益地统治人类。但这只是基于他们的价值观，这些价值观完全不尊重个人的自由，也不重视人类自然的伟大特质以及人类成就。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Will anyone from space come to save humanity?”</p>
<p>“是否会有来自太空的势力来拯救人类？”</p>
<p>No one will come to save humanity, and those who claim to be here for this purpose represent the Intervention itself. If humanity is ever to become strong and self-determined in the universe, it must save itself. What it needs from other races in the universe is the kind of wisdom and guidance we are providing through these sets of Briefings. This is what any other society in the universe who cares about humanity’s future and freedom could give in a world where a divided humanity is struggling with itself, despoiling its world and undermining the three basic achievements that are necessary for freedom: unity, self-sufficiency and discretion.</p>
<p>没有人会来拯救人类，那些声称为此目的而来的种族代表了干预本身。如果人类想要在宇宙中变得强大且自决，它必须自我拯救。人类所需要的是来自宇宙中其他种族的智慧和指导，我们正在通过这些简报提供这种智慧和指导。这是宇宙中任何关心人类未来和自由的其他社会所能给予的唯一帮助，在这个世界上，一个分裂的人类正在与自己斗争，掠夺它的世界，破坏自由所必需的三个基本成就：团结、自给自足和谨慎。</p>
<p>Do not think that others will come here to save humanity, for they will come here to save the world for themselves, and humanity will be but a resource they will use to achieve their own goals. Do not be foolish and naïve. Do not think that other races would expend the energy and invest themselves to such a great degree just to assure your freedom, for such an investment must be for their own purposes. This requires careful thought and consideration on your part, a very sober approach and a greater objectivity.</p>
<p>不要认为其他种族会来到这里拯救人类，因为他们会为了自己的利益而来拯救这个世界，而人类只是他们为实现自身目标所利用的资源。不要愚蠢和天真。不要认为其他种族会消耗极大的精力和资源，仅仅是为了确保你们的自由，因为这样的投入必然是为了他们自己的目的。这需要你们仔细思考、慎重考虑，采取非常冷静的态度，并具备更大的客观性。</p>
<hr>
<p>“If conquest is not allowed in this region of space, how can an Intervention occur and be successful?”</p>
<p>“如果在这个空间区域内不允许发生征服，那么干预如何进行并且成功呢？”</p>
<p>Conquest is not allowed in this region of space, so other means are sought through inducements, through the offering of gifts of technology and through persuading a native race that it alone cannot govern itself or assure its own future. It is these same persuasions that humanity places upon itself through its commercial and political persuasions.</p>
<p>在这个空间区域不允许征服，因此寻求其他手段，通过诱惑、提供技术礼物以及说服当地种族认为它自己无法治理自己或保障自己的未来。这种说服方式与人类在其商业和政治影响中对自身施加的那些说服力非常相似。</p>
<p>Humanity has a greater destiny and a greater potential. Humanity can establish a sustainable use of this world. It can establish this security and stability, but it will have to proceed very differently than it is proceeding now. Otherwise, it will think that others will come to give it gifts, to uplift its science and technology, to show it how to live in peace.</p>
<p>人类拥有更伟大的天命和潜力。人类可以建立对这个世界的可持续使用。它可以建立这种安全与稳定，但它必须以非常不同的方式进行，而不是现在正在进行的方式。否则，人类会认为其他种族是前来赠送礼物的，提升其科技水平，教导它如何和平地生活。</p>
<p>But this is where you are vulnerable and fall easily under foreign persuasion. For such a peace does not exist amongst those who are intervening in the world. And there is no free energy in the universe that is truly free.</p>
<p>但这正是你们最脆弱之处，最容易陷入外来说服的地方。因为那些干预世界的种族之间并不存在你们所期待的那种和平，宇宙中也不存在真正自由的能源。</p>
<p>They will come to exploit you and to take advantage of your expectations and your naiveté. Therefore, you must be very wary here and very cautious. It is these powers of persuasion and powers of influence in the mental environment that will have such a great impact upon human thinking, human expectations and human emotions.</p>
<p>他们会来剥削你们，利用你们的期望和天真。因此，你们在这里必须非常警觉，非常谨慎。正是这些在心理环境中的说服力和影响力，将对人类的思维、人类的期望和人类的情感产生如此大的影响。</p>
<p>Here you either make yourself available to such persuasion, or you recognize you must resist it. Here humanity’s approach will make all the difference, for truly a small non-military force could gain ascendancy in the world without the use of force. It could do this through the power of persuasion and by offering the native people things that they think they want. This is how native peoples have been seduced throughout human history by other intervening powers. Now you are facing intervening forces from the universe, whose persuasion is much more sophisticated and much more powerful. If you are in their proximity, they can control your thinking, your feelings and your perception. This is the power they have of influence in the mental environment.</p>
<p>在这里，你要么让自己受到这种说服，要么认识到你必须抵制它。在这里，人类的应对方式将决定一切，因为实际上，一个小型的非军事势力可以在不使用武力的情况下，获得对世界的统治。它可以通过说服的力量，通过向原住民提供他们认为自己想要的东西来做到这一点。在整个人类历史上，原住民就是这样被其他干预国家所诱惑的。而现在，你们正面临来自宇宙的干预势力，它们的说服方式更加复杂、更加强大。如果你处在它们的影响范围内，它们可以控制你的思维、情感和感知。这就是它们在心理环境中的影响力量。</p>
<p>You can withstand this power because of the presence of Knowledge within yourself, the Knowledge that the Creator of all life has placed within you. For it cannot be persuaded. It cannot be deceived. And it cannot be corrupted. You will need to gain access to this greater Knowledge if you are to remain free and to develop wisdom and maturity in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>你可以抵御这种力量，因为在你的内心深处有内识的存在，它是所有生命的创造者放置在你们内心深处的内识。因为它无法被说服、无法被欺骗、无法被腐蚀。如果你们想要保持自由，并在大社区中发展智慧与成熟，你们将会需要获得这种更伟大的内识。</p>

<p>“What role, if any, do our governments play in assisting the activities of the Intervention?”</p>
<p>“如果有的话，我们的政府在协助干预的活动中扮演了什么角色？”</p>
<p>Some governments have assisted the Intervention, only to find it is working against them, and that it is deceptive and untrustworthy. Major governments in the world today have had contact in the past and have made certain agreements to allow the Intervention to function here in exchange for certain kinds of technology. But this has given license to a very dangerous intrusion into the human world and into human societies. Its influence is considerable and is directed to those individuals who are deemed to be the most compliant and the most easily persuaded.</p>
<p>一些政府确实协助了干预活动，但他们最终发现，这些干预实际上在反对他们，且充满欺骗性与不可信任。当今世界的主要政府过去都曾有过接触，并达成了某些协议，允许干预在这里运作，以换取某些种类的技术。但是，这也给了一种非常危险的入侵人类世界和人类社会的许可。干预的影响力是相当显著的，主要针对那些被认为是最顺从、最容易被说服的个人。</p>
<p>But in recent times, there has been a shift to influence those in positions of leadership in commerce, for they are not accountable to the public. They are unelected and go largely unrecognized by the human population. They garner tremendous wealth, and they do not claim to have great scruples, such as your elected officials might proclaim. They can operate in secrecy, with very little accountability to anyone.</p>
<p>但在最近的时间里，已经出现了一个转变，即影响那些在商业中处于领导地位的人，因为他们不需要对公众负责。他们并非通过选举产生，也在很大程度上未被大众所承认。他们拥有巨大的财富，并且不像你们的民选官员那样声称具有道德原则。他们可以秘密地运作，几乎无需向任何人负责。</p>
<p>There has been a change, therefore, in the Intervention’s emphasis to move towards individuals in positions of leadership in commerce, particularly regarding resource acquisition and distribution. For these individuals hold great power in these arenas and are far more easily persuaded. Your people know not of what is occurring in your midst.</p>
<p>因此，干预的重点已经发生了改变，转向在商业中处于领导地位的个人，特别是在资源获取和分配方面。因为这些人在这些领域拥有巨大的权力，也更容易被说服。你们的民众对此几乎一无所知。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Are any of the world’s governments resisting the Intervention?”</p>
<p>“世界上有任何政府在抵制干预吗？”</p>
<p>Yes, the United States and Russia are resisting the Intervention. That is one of the reasons they have ceased their competition that was so destructive over many decades. They are more cooperative now, for they realize they need one another to be successful in offsetting the impacts and the persuasion that is being cast upon humanity.</p>
<p>是的，美国和俄罗斯正在抵制干预。这也是它们停止几十年来破坏性极大的竞争的原因之一。它们现在更加合作，因为它们意识到，要想成功抵消对人类的影响和说服，它们需要彼此合作。</p>
<p>There are smaller governments assisting now, but primarily it is these two greater powers that hold such great military strength and persuasion in the world. It is they who had fallen under alien deception, and it is they who have now turned against the Intervention. That is why our contact on Earth, Marshall Vian Summers, can receive this information and can receive our Briefings and counsel without fear of government suppression.</p>
<p>目前还有一些较小的政府也在提供帮助，但主要是这两个大国在世界拥有如此强大的军事力量和说服力。他们曾经也陷入外星势力的欺骗之中，但他们现在已经转向反对干预。这就是为什么我们在地球上的联系人马歇尔·维安·萨默斯可以收到这些信息，可以接受我们的简报和咨询，而不必担心政府的压制。</p>
<p>He is being watched, we are sure, though we cannot tell to what extent. He is providing a service not only to the peoples of the world, but also to those governments who are aware of the Intervention and who are now opposing its presence and its activities in the world.</p>
<p>我们确信，他被监视着，尽管我们无法确定监视的程度。他不仅在为世界各国人民提供服务，也在为那些察觉到干预并反对干预在世界上的存在和活动的政府提供服务。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Human scientists say that no one can travel faster than the speed of light. Therefore, how is it possible that the Intervention can come here or even that you could come here?”</p>
<p>“人类科学家说，没有人能比光速更快地旅行。因此，干预是如何到达这里的，甚至你们又是如何到达这里的呢？”</p>
<p>This premise is certainly one that limits human understanding. If you could not travel faster than these speeds, you could not travel in space at all, and that perhaps is the assumption of many who still think that this is a barrier that cannot be surpassed.</p>
<p>这个前提无疑是限制了人类的理解。如果你不能以比光速更快的速度旅行，那就无法进行任何太空旅行，这也许是许多人的假设，他们仍然认为这是一个无法超越的障碍。</p>
<p>Even before there were any human civilizations in the world, space travel was underway to a very large and sophisticated extent. You can travel faster than the speed of light and counteract its effect on time and aging, and this has been practiced far longer than any human civilization.</p>
<p>在世界上还没有任何人类文明之前，太空旅行就已经以非常大规模和复杂的程度进行着。你可以用超过光速的速度旅行，并抵消光速对时间和衰老的影响，这个技术远在任何人类文明之前就已经得到了实践。</p>
<p>But travel is not as fast as you might think or imagine. It still takes time to travel between solar systems—sometimes, in your estimation and time frame, days and weeks or even months, depending on the distance one has to traverse. This, of course, would be astoundingly fast according to your notion, but you are still crawling along at a slow pace while other nations have been engaged in commerce, trade and travel for hundreds of thousands of your years, even in your region of space.</p>
<p>但是，旅行并不像你们所想的或想象的那样快。太阳系之间的旅行仍然需要时间——有时在你们的估算和时间框架内，这可能是几天、几周，甚至几个月，取决于需要跨越的距离。尽管如此，根据你们的标准，这已经是惊人的速度了，但你们仍然以缓慢的速度前进，而其他国家在你们几十万年的时间里，甚至在你们所在的空间区域里，一直在从事商业、贸易和旅行活动。</p>
<p>You do not live in some newly developed part of the universe. There has been a long history in this region, longer even than we can account for—a history of early war, conquest and conflict. This has been surpassed by a greater unity, a great network of trade and a great network of control—which has suppressed war and conflict, but which has also suppressed freedom and self-determination amongst its participating nations.</p>
<p>你们并不生活在宇宙中新开发的区域。在这个区域中有着比我们所能追溯的还要悠久的历史——早期的战争、征服和冲突的历史。这些历史已被更大的统一、庞大的贸易网络以及控制网络所取代——虽然这些网络抑制了战争和冲突，但也抑制了参与国的自由和自决。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must consider that this barrier, called the speed of light, is something that humanity, in some distant future, will be able to overcome. Even on its own it will find a way to do this. But surely it cannot hold to such a limit as being defining. For we have come to be near the Earth, and now we are far away from the Earth, and the Intervention has come to intervene in the world, which it is doing now ever so greatly with each passing year. Trade and commerce is going on in many regions inside the galaxy, and we may only assume in other galaxies as well. So never think that technology in the universe is limited by human understanding or accomplishment.</p>
<p>因此，你必须考虑到，这个被称为光速的障碍，是人类在遥远的未来能够克服的。即使是人类自身也将找到方法来做到这一点。但显然，它不可能将这样的限制视为定义。因为我们已经来到了地球附近，而现在我们已经远离了地球，干预者已经来到这个世界，并且随着每年的过去，它正在以极大的方式进行干预。银河系内的许多地区都在进行贸易和商业活动，我们只能假设在其他星系也是如此。因此，绝不要认为宇宙中的技术会被人类的理解或成就所限制。</p>
<hr>
<p>“When will humanity be able to travel outside this solar system?”</p>
<p>”人类什么时候能在这个太阳系之外旅行？“</p>
<p>Your travel outside this solar system may be possible within the next two centuries, but we say “may be possible” because you will have to face the great environmental change that is occurring in your world, which has the power to undermine human civilization. And you also have to face the consequences of intervention in your world, which could usurp human authority here and place humanity under foreign control and domination. Either of these two events could alter the course of human destiny thoroughly, could stifle and control humanity’s accomplishments and its destiny as a free and self-determined peoples in the universe.</p>
<p>你们可能在未来两百年内有机会进行太阳系外的旅行，但我们说的是“可能”是因为你们必须面对地球上正在发生的巨大环境变化，这种变化有能力破坏人类的文明。你们还必须面对干预的后果，它可能会篡夺人类在地球上的权威，并将人类置于外来控制和统治之下。这两个事件中的任何一个都可能彻底改变人类的天命，扼杀和控制人类的成就和它作为宇宙中一个自由和自决的民族的天命。</p>
<p>Therefore, there are great dangers facing you now, and that is why our Briefings are so important and why we have been called by greater Spiritual Powers to come to the Earth to deliver our messages to a worthy world and a worthy people.</p>
<p>因此，你们现在正面临着巨大的危险，这就是为什么我们的简报如此重要，以及我们为什么被更伟大的精神力量召唤来到地球，向一个有价值的世界和值得的人民传递我们的讯息。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You speak of individual freedom being rare in the universe. Why is this so?”</p>
<p>“你说个人自由在宇宙中是罕见的。为什么会这样？”</p>
<p>Freedom is difficult to cultivate. It can be unruly and disorganized. It can lead to dangerous individual assertions. It can have disastrous consequences if it is not governed wisely and conscientiously. It is far easier for nations to exert control and to establish authority over their peoples and societies. That is why most nations choose this easier and more expedient path, even though it leads to a far less productive and creative outcome.</p>
<p>自由是很难培养的。它可能会变得不受约束且混乱。如果没有智慧和谨慎的管理，它可能会导致危险的个人主张，甚至会带来灾难性的后果。因此，国家更容易施加控制，确立对其人民和社会的权威。这就是为什么大多数国家选择了这种更容易、更便捷的道路，尽管它导致了较低的生产力和创造力。</p>
<p>Freedom is difficult to cultivate even on an individual level. It requires responsibility. It requires awareness. It requires wise governance and counsel. It requires a wise leadership and a willing and educated population. These things are all very challenging to establish, and that is why many nations choose the alternative route to stability.</p>
<p>即使在个人层面上，自由也是难以培养的。它需要责任感。它需要责觉知。它需要责明智的治理和咨询。它需要一个明智的领导和一个愿意接受教育的民众。这些都是非常具有挑战性的事情，这也是许多国家选择通过抑制自由来维持稳定的原因。</p>
<p>We believe, however, that the path of individual freedom leads to a stronger nation and to greater creativity and accomplishments amongst its citizens for the benefit of all. We believe that repressive societies, though they may be common in the universe, do not have this creativity and cannot benefit from the wisdom and the greater purpose that each person carries. Thus, their achievements are limited, and they tend to copy one another, for they are not creative. New technology, new wisdom and new ways of creative social governance are not established in these nations. They are conservative, and they resist progressive thinking and progressive accomplishments.</p>
<p>然而，我们相信，个人自由的道路会导致一个更强大的国家，并为其公民带来更大的创造力和成就，惠及所有人。我们相信，压制性的社会尽管在宇宙中普遍存在，但没有这种创造力，就无法从每个人所携带的智慧且更伟大的目的中获益。因此，这些社会的成就是有限的，倾向于互相模仿，因为它们缺乏创造力。新的技术、新的智慧以及新的创造性社会治理方式在这些国家中是无法建立的。他们是保守的，他们抵制进步的思想和进步的成就。</p>
<p>Here humanity must see that it has one of two pathways to follow in establishing greater security and stability in the world. It will either create a repressive regime that will enforce order and stifle the creativity and freedom of individuals. Or it will choose the more difficult path of establishing a freer, more creative and more productive society.</p>
<p>在这里，人类必须看到，在建立世界上更大的安全和稳定方面，它只有两条路可以选择。它要么建立一个压制性的政权，强制执行秩序，扼杀个人的创造力和自由；要么它会选择更艰难的道路，建立一个更加自由、更有创造力和更有生产力的社会。</p>
<p>It is our hope and wish that humanity will choose the path of freedom and build the freedom that it has already established in many parts of the world. It has, of course, a long way to go in doing this, and it is not an easy task. But now with the prospect of diminishing resources in the world and the presence of intervening, manipulative forces, humanity faces a great challenge in this regard.</p>
<p>我们希望并祝愿人类会选择自由的道路，并在世界上已经确立的许多地方进一步发展自由。当然，要做到这一点，它还有很长的路要走，这不是一项简单的任务。但现在，随着世界上资源的减少，以及干预、操纵性力量的存在，人类在这方面面临着巨大的挑战。</p>
<p>You can never take your freedom for granted in the universe. Freedom is a privilege and not merely a right. It must be built with strength and wisdom, and it must be protected with vigilance, always.</p>
<p>在宇宙中，你们永远不能认为自己的自由是理所当然的。自由是一种特权，而不仅仅是一种权利。它必须用力量和智慧来建立，并且需要时刻保持警惕来加以保护。</p>
<hr>
<p>“If you were caught by the Intervention, what would happen to you and would there be consequences for your own worlds?”</p>
<p>“如果你们被干预者抓住，会发生什么，会对你们自己的世界产生什么样的后果？”</p>
<p>If we were to be caught by the intervening forces, we would be tortured and exposed to cruel punishment to extract from us any information that we might have. Our home worlds would be discerned, and great external pressure would be brought to bear upon the leaders of our nations regarding our presence and influence here in the world. For our worlds have established agreements of non-interference in regions outside of our own, and this is what gives us our autonomy, an autonomy that is always fragile and under scrutiny for the possibility of revision.</p>
<p>如果我们被干预势力抓住，我们将遭受酷刑和残忍的惩罚，以便他们从我们身上提取出任何有用的信息。他们会查明我们的家园星球，并对我们的国家领导施加巨大的外部压力，要求他们对我们的存在和在地球上提供的影响做出解释。因为我们所在的世界已经签订了不干涉我们自己以外地区的协议，而正是这些协议赋予了我们自主权。然而，这种自主权始终是脆弱的，并且随时可能面临修订的风险。</p>
<p>According to our agreements, we are not allowed to be in the vicinity of your world giving such counsel, even if we are not directly intervening. But we are nearby, and our purpose is noble and worthy and guided by a greater Source. So certainly we would be tortured and destroyed, those of us who are gathered for this purpose. And our worlds would come under greater scrutiny and tremendous pressure, and our contracts guaranteeing our autonomy would be threatened and challenged.</p>
<p>根据我们的协议，我们不被允许在你们的世界附近提供这样的建议，即使我们并没有直接干预。但是我们确实在附近，我们的目的是崇高的、有价值的，并由一个更伟大的源头指引。所以，如果我们被抓住，毫无疑问，我们将遭受酷刑和毁灭，我们这群人为此目的聚集在一起的人将面临这种命运。而我们的世界将受到更严格的审查和极大的压力，我们保障自主权的合同将受到威胁和挑战。</p>
<p>This would be grave for our leadership. Therefore, we act with the greatest secrecy. That is why we do not describe our appearance. That is why we do not give our names, describe our worlds or tell you where our worlds reside. It is of the utmost importance to us that these things remain secret. We have not even revealed them to our contact here on Earth. Nor would we do so. For any human mind can be interfered with, and its understanding can be extracted by those intervening forces in the world now.</p>
<p>这对我们的领导层来说将是极其严重的后果。因此，我们的行动是最隐秘的。这就是为什么我们不描述我们的外表，不提供我们的名字，不描述我们的星球，也不告诉你们我们的世界位于何处。这对我们至关重要，这些信息必须保持绝对的秘密。我们甚至没有向我们在地球上的联系人透露这些信息，我们也不会这样做。因为任何人类的心灵都可能被干预入侵，它的理解可以被现在世界上的那些干预势力所提取。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must understand the importance of discretion. That is why it is one of the three requirements for establishing and maintaining freedom in the universe: unity, self-sufficiency and discretion. You are only at the beginning of learning about the power of the mental environment. You are only beginning to learn how other races can gain access to human wisdom and understanding. You are only beginning to realize how much your freedom will have to be guarded and protected if it is to be sustained in a universe where freedom is rare.</p>
<p>因此，你们必须理解谨慎的重要性。这就是为什么它是宇宙中建立和维持自由的三大要求之一：团结、自给自足和谨慎。你们只是刚刚开始学习心理环境的力量。你们刚刚开始学习其他种族如何获取人类的智慧和理解。你们才刚刚开始意识到，如果要在这个自由稀缺的宇宙中维持你们的自由，你们的自由是多么需要守护和保护。</p>
<hr>
<p>“The Briefings state that the Intervention is promoting human conflict. How does it do this? Can you give us an example of what you have seen so far?”</p>
<p>“简报提到干预在促进人类的冲突。它是如何做到的？你能给我们一个你们已经看到的例子吗？”</p>
<p>You have but to promote religious extremism and nationalism and to convince the leaders and persuasive individuals that other peoples represent their enemy and a threat. You have only to project the images of spiritual saints and emissaries proclaiming the need to overcome adversaries. This is how the Intervention can promote conflict in the world. The United States’ engagement and its war in the nation of Iraq is a very good example of leaders being persuaded to do something that is utterly foolish, to engage in an intractable conflict with no certain outcome, committing so much of its resources, even risking world opinion to engage in this manner. Other nations, particularly nations that are powerful and influential, will be engaged in this way through persuasion by the Intervention—to diminish their power, to diminish their influence, to diminish the morale of their own peoples and to diminish their economies. For the Intervention needs humanity to decline in order to present itself as truly beneficial to human destiny.</p>
<p>干预只需宣扬宗教极端主义和民族主义，并说服领导人和有说服力的人，其他民族代表他们的敌人和威胁。干预只需投射精神圣人和使者的形象，传递战胜敌人的信息。这就是干预在世界范围内促进冲突的方式。美国在伊拉克国家的介入和战争是一个非常好的例子，领导人被说服去做一些完全愚蠢的事情，去参与一个没有确定结果的棘手的冲突，投入如此多的资源，甚至冒着世界舆论的风险以这种方式介入。其他国家，特别是那些强大而有影响力的国家，也会在干预的说服下以这种方式参与进来——削弱它们的力量，削弱它们的影响力，削弱它们本国人民的士气，削弱它们的经济。因为干预需要人类的衰落，以显示自己真正有益于人类的天命。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Intervention will seek to weaken the strongest powers to degrade their influence in the world and to create an overall situation where the Intervention will be deemed truly valuable, and its counsel and its guidance will be attended to and followed.</p>
<p>因此，干预将试图削弱最强大的国家，以削弱它在世界上的影响力，并创造一种整体的局势，使干预行动被认为是真正有价值的，其建议和指导将被关注和遵循。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You also indicate that the Intervention is pacifying people. How can it pacify people and yet promote human conflict?”</p>
<p>“你还提到干预正在安抚人们。它怎么能在安抚人民的同时促进人类的冲突呢？”</p>
<p>The Intervention is pacifying certain populations—the young people, the educated, those who are spiritually inclined, those who could not be encouraged to wage war or conflict against others. Those who could be the greatest emissaries for the Intervention will be pacified and directed. They will believe in the new leadership. They will believe that the Intervention is here to save a struggling and declining humanity.</p>
<p>干预正在安抚特定的群体——年轻人、受过教育的人、那些有精神倾向的人，以及那些无法被鼓动去对他人发动战争或冲突的人。那些可以成为干预最佳使者的人将被安抚和引导。他们会相信新的领导层，他们会相信干预是为了拯救一个正在挣扎和衰退的人类。</p>
<p>Those who cannot be pacified can be encouraged to engage in their ancient animosities and their distrust of their neighbors, and to fortify their resistance and hostility towards their historic enemies. Lands can be contested. Resources will be contested increasingly. Even within nations, there will be groups who will arise, who will seek to destabilize and overtake those nations. Many groups will be governed by religious ideology, governed not only by the defaults of human nature, but also by the influence and guidance exerted by the Intervention itself.</p>
<p>对于那些无法被安抚的人，可以鼓励他们重拾宿怨和对邻国的不信任，并加强他们对历史敌人的抵抗和敌意。土地可以被争夺，资源的争夺将会日益加剧。即使在一个国家内部，也会有一些团体出现，他们会试图颠覆并接管这些国家。许多团体将受宗教意识形态的支配，不仅受到人类本性缺陷的影响，还受到干预本身施加的影响和引导。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Is the Intervention manipulating food production or any other industries here on Earth?”</p>
<p>“干预是否在操控地球上的粮食生产或任何其他行业？”</p>
<p>The Intervention does not need to manipulate food production, as it is declining as a result of humanity’s impact on your own environment. Other industries, such as the military industries—industries that supply and support military efforts and military adventures—these are certainly being encouraged. There are forces encouraging human conflict. This represents the impact of the Intervention. While there is an incentive for peace, there is also an incentive for conquest. That is why many nations are building their military capacity. At least they were when we were last in the vicinity of your world, and we must assume that this is continuing.</p>
<p>干预并不需要操纵粮食生产，因为人类对自身环境的影响正在导致粮食产量下降。至于其他行业，例如军事产业——提供和支持军事行动和军事冒险的产业——这些确实正在被鼓励。有一些势力在鼓励人类的冲突。这代表了干预的影响。在鼓励和平的同时，也在鼓励军事征服。这就是为什么许多国家都在增强军事力量。至少在我们上次靠近你们的世界时是这样的，我们必须假设这种情况还在继续。</p>
<p>This is not only the result of human mistrust and human fear. It also represents the impact of the Intervention. The Intervention is not threatened by your weapons. Only nuclear power and nuclear weapons threaten its existence here. And these things cannot be used without great consequence to the welfare and to the future of humanity.</p>
<p>这不仅是人类不信任和人类恐惧的结果，它也代表了干预的影响。干预行动并不受你们武器的威胁，只有核能和核武器才能威胁到它在这里的存在。如果使用这些武器，就会对人类的福祉和未来造成严重后果。</p>
<p>The Intervention is using power in the mental environment—the powers of persuasion, powers which humanity is only beginning to discern and to understand. Humanity still thinks that military power will determine its fate and its future, but in a universe of greater skill and greater influence, this will not prove to be effective. This represents a new threshold of learning and accomplishment for the human family.</p>
<p>干预正在使用心理环境中的能力——即说服的力量，这种力量人类才刚刚开始辨别和理解。人类仍然认为军事力量将决定其命运和未来，但在一个具有更大技能和更大影响的宇宙中，这将被证明是无效的。这代表了人类大家庭学习和成就的一个新门槛。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Can you reveal where the Intervention bases on Earth are so that we can shut them down?”</p>
<p>“你能透露干预在地球上的基地位置吗，以便我们能关闭它们？”</p>
<p>We do not have full knowledge of this. Certainly, the first bases were established in the oceans and shallow waters, away from the presence of human military forces—in the Arctic regions and in areas where there is no military establishment. Bases underground, which are far more difficult to establish, have been built in mountain regions. Transmitters have been established in mountain regions, which have cities at their base—transmitters to affect the mental environment and pacify the public. This represents one of the efforts of the Intervention.</p>
<p>我们对此没有完全的了解。最初的基地确实是在远离人类军事力量的地方建立的，位于海洋和浅水区——在北极地区和没有军事设施的地方。地下基地的建立要困难得多，他们已经在山区建立了这些基地。在山区建立了发射器，这些发射器的基地有城市，用于影响心理环境并安抚公众。这代表了干预行动的努力之一。</p>
<p>We do not know where all of these transmitters have been placed, but we do know they are being used. We do not know where all the bases have been established, particularly on land. We were never near enough to the surface of the Earth to be able to witness these things ourselves and can only understand their existence by deciphering the transmissions of the Intervention. Yet it is enough for you to know that such bases exist here and that there is a significant alien presence in the world. It is not a military presence. It represents the skillful use of commercial forces by those who have gained power and influence in the mental environment.</p>
<p>我们不知道这些发射器的全部位置，但我们知道它们正在使用中。我们也不知道所有基地的具体位置，尤其是在陆地上。我们从未足够接近地球表面亲眼见证这些基地的存在，只能通过破译干预的传输信息来理解它们的存在。然而，这足以让你们知道地球存在这样的基地，并且世界上有着显著的外星存在就足够了。它不是一种军事存在，它代表了那些在心理环境中获得力量和影响力的干预对商业势力的巧妙利用。</p>
<p>You will have to change your understanding of the use of power to realize how strong an influence this is and how much more effective it is towards establishing your goals and priorities than the exertion of military power. The exertion of military power is restrained in your world, and it is greatly suppressed in this part of the galaxy.</p>
<p>你将不得不改变你对力量使用的理解，才能意识到这是一种多么强大的影响，它在确立你们的目标和优先事项方面比使用军事力量要有效得多。在你们的世界，军事力量的运用受到限制，而在银河系的这一部分，它更是被极大地压制了。</p>
<hr>
<p>“If the Intervention is overcome, what should humanity do with all the individuals who are a result of the hybridization program?”</p>
<p>“如果干预被克服，人类应该如何处理所有作为杂交计划结果的个人？”</p>
<p>If the Intervention can be overcome, you will face future interventions. But regarding the presence of such individuals, you will have to reincorporate them into the human society, and that will require a great investment of time and energy. These individuals will actually be able to be beneficial participants in society, but their understanding and the influences upon them will have to change remarkably.</p>
<p>如果干预能够被克服，你们还将面临未来的干预。但是关于这些个体的存在，你们将不得不把他们重新纳入人类社会，这将需要投入大量的时间和精力。这些个体实际上能够成为社会中的有益参与者，但他们的理解和他们受到的影响必须发生显著的改变。</p>
<p>Some could become wise seers. But it is their allegiance to humanity that will have to be fully established, and they will have to learn to shield themselves from the effects of the Intervention, which can influence them even if the Intervention is not present in the world. For in space, influence in the mental environment can accrue over vast distances. Once influence has been established, this can take place.</p>
<p>有些人可能会成为明智的先知，但他们对人类的忠诚必须完全建立起来，他们必须学会保护自己不受干预的影响，即便干预不再出现在世界上，干预也会影响他们。因为在太空中，心理环境中的影响可以跨越巨大的距离。一旦影响建立起来，控制就可以发生。</p>
<p>This will be a challenge. These individuals can become beneficial to humanity if their allegiance can be placed here and if persuasions upon them can be minimized or eliminated.</p>
<p>这将是一个挑战。如果这些个体的效忠可以归属在人类这里，并且对他们的影响能够得到最小化或消除，他们就可以成为对人类有益的人。</p>

<p>“Inter-dimensional travel seems to be the fastest way to get around in space. Why is it not being used?”</p>
<p>“跨维度旅行似乎是宇宙中最快的交通方式。为什么它没有被使用？”</p>
<p>Inter-dimensional travel, though greatly promising, has proven to be disastrous, for you cannot control your reentry, and even if you could find one of the portals, which are constantly in motion, you would not be able to ascertain where you would emerge—into what kind of physical environment or physical condition you would find yourself. That is why so many craft that have attempted this transference have never returned.</p>
<p>跨维度旅行，尽管有很大的潜力，却被证明是灾难性的，因为你无法控制你的重返，即使你能找到那些门户——它们不断移动——你也无法确定你会在哪里出现——你会发现自己身处什么样的物理环境或身体状况。这就是为什么许多尝试过这种转移的飞船再也没有回来的原因。</p>
<p>The portals remain a mystery. Inter-dimensional travel remains a hypothesis. We know that certain races have been able to bridge the gulf between dimensions. They have been able to communicate from the other dimension, but they were not able to return, and contact with them was short lived, leading to an uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>这些门户依然是一个谜，跨维度旅行依然是一种假设。我们知道某些种族能够跨越维度之间的鸿沟，他们已经能够从另一个维度进行交流，但他们无法返回，而且与他们的联系是短暂的，导致不确定的结果。</p>
<p>Humanity hopes and believes that such things will be available to it so that it can travel anywhere it wants, to move across the galaxy in an instant, to emerge in any environment. But the reality of the Greater Community will change these notions, will temper your ambitions and will show you a very different reality than the one that you imagine for yourself.</p>
<p>人类希望并相信这样的技术将成为可能，这样它就可以去任何它想去的地方，在瞬间横跨银河系，出现在任何环境中。但大社区的现实将改变这些观念，抑制你们的野心，并展示与你们想象的完全不同的现实。</p>
<p>Even if you could emerge through such travel, you would end up in the vicinity of foreign worlds with whom you do not have relations or in physical environments that are entirely hazardous. You would have no way of charting a corridor route there unless you had allies existing in that region. And such alliances would be very difficult to establish, for no race wants to be intruded upon by races from afar in this manner. This would be a challenge to their security and to their network of local trade. They would be greatly threatened by the appearance of a foreign race with whom they had no history or relations.</p>
<p>即便你能够通过这种方式旅行，你最终也会出现在与你没有关系的外星世界附近，或者出现在完全危险的物理环境中。除非你在该地区有盟友的存在，否则你没有办法在那里绘制一条安全的通道路线。而这种盟友关系是很难建立的，因为没有哪个种族愿意被来自远方的种族以这种方式入侵。这将对他们的安全和当地的贸易网络构成挑战。他们会对出现的外来种族感到极大的威胁，尤其是一个与他们没有任何历史或关系的外来种族。</p>
<p>You have but to think of these things more carefully, more objectively, to see and to understand what we are conveying to you. This requires a serious consideration. Otherwise, you will continue to indulge in fantasies of high technology and instantaneous space travel. But you will have to face a very different reality as you emerge into a Greater Community of life.</p>
<p>你需要更仔细、更客观地思考这些事情，才能看清并理解我们传达给你的信息。这需要认真的思考，否则你会继续沉迷于高科技和瞬间空间旅行的幻想中。但是，当你们出现在一个生命的大社区中时，你们将不得不面对一个非常不同的现实。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Many people here on Earth would love to travel to other worlds and meet other races there, yet you indicate that this would be very limited. Why is this the case?”</p>
<p>“地球上的许多人都想去其他世界旅行，并在那里遇到其他种族，然而你表示这将是非常有限的。为什么会出现这种情况？”</p>
<p>Most nations do not welcome visitation unless it is from those who are its longstanding trading partners, and even here visitation will be limited, for societies do not want to be influenced by other societies. Certainly any free nation would not be welcome to visit a nation that is not free.</p>
<p>大多数国家并不欢迎访问，除非是来自长期的贸易伙伴，即使是这种情况，访问也是有限的，因为社会不希望受到其他社会的影响。当然，任何自由的国家都不欢迎访问一个不自由的国家。</p>
<p>Then there is the problem of biological contamination. We can think of no world where humanity would be welcome at all given the biological reality of your world and the tremendous threat it could impose upon a foreign world. They are not prepared to deal with the innumerable biological agents and influences that exist here, and to receive an emissary from Earth would be a very challenging prospect for them.</p>
<p>此外，还存在生物污染的问题。我们想不到有任何世界会欢迎人类的到来，考虑到你们世界的生物现实以及它对外星世界可能带来的巨大威胁。他们无法应对来自地球的无数生物因素和影响，接待来自地球的使者对他们来说将是非常具有挑战性的事情。</p>
<p>If they were not a free society, they would not be interested in your individual expressions. They would be threatened by your music and your art. They would not want these influences to be exerted upon their cultures. They would not want their own populations to witness you or to understand you, for in this, you would be a great threat to them and to all they have invested in establishing their highly controlled societies.</p>
<p>如果他们不是一个自由社会，他们就不会对你们的个人表达感兴趣。他们会受到你们的音乐和艺术的威胁。他们不希望这些影响被施加到他们的文化上。他们不希望自己的民众看到你们或了解你们，因为在这方面，你们会对他们构成巨大的威胁，并挑战他们为建立高度控制的社会所投入的一切。</p>
<p>You would not be able to reach other nations because you would have to cross territories owned by others. You would have to use trade routes governed by trading authorities. You would have to make agreements and compromises. You would have to come to terms with many other powers just to travel freely in this region of space. If you traveled outside these established routes, you would always face the danger of piracy. You would also face the danger of becoming lost.</p>
<p>你们也无法随意到达其他国家，因为你们需要跨越属于其他国家的领土，需要使用由贸易当局管理的贸易路线。你们必须达成协议，做出妥协。要想在这个空间区域自由旅行，你们必须与许多其他国家达成条款。如果你们偏离这些既定路线，随时都可能面临海盗的危险，还可能迷失在太空中。</p>
<p>Even amongst our worlds, we would not welcome human visitation at this time, for you are not yet wise enough, united enough or discerning enough for us to establish active relations with you. That is why no one should be intervening in the world. No one should be attempting to establish relations with the human family, and those that do are here for their own purposes, to establish their own quest for power and domination.</p>
<p>即使在我们的世界中，我们也不欢迎人类在这个时候来访，因为你们还没有足够的明智、团结和辨别力，无法与我们建立积极的关系。这就是为什么没有国家应该干预这个世界。任何国家都不应该试图与人类大家族建立关系，那些试图与人类大家族建立关系的国家都是为了他们自己的目的，为了建立他们自己对权力和统治的追求。</p>
<p>You, who are naïve and do not understand the realities of life and travel in the universe, have yet to see these things clearly. But if you think carefully about this, you will understand. There are nations even within your own world that you could not visit freely at this moment because they are not free, because they would not welcome your influence and your presence in their midst. Though such nations are few, their examples serve to illustrate what we are saying.</p>
<p>你们这些天真的人，你们对宇宙中的生命和旅行现实还缺乏理解，尚未清晰地看到这些事情。但如果你们仔细思考，你们就会理解。甚至在你们自己的世界里也有一些国家，你们此时不能自由访问，因为他们不自由，因为他们不欢迎你们的影响和你们在他们中间的存在。虽然这样的国家为数不多，但它们的例子说明了我们所表达的观点。</p>
<p>The universe is far more diverse, and its societies are far more different from one another than anything you have established here on Earth. Races are far more different from each other. And trust in relations can take a very long time to establish and is always maintained with great scrutiny and care. This represents the reality that you will face as you emerge into this larger arena of life.</p>
<p>宇宙远比地球多样化，各社会之间的差异远超你们在地球上所建立的一切。种族之间的差异更为显著。而信任关系的建立需要很长时间，且始终在严格的审查和谨慎中维持。这代表了你们在进入这个更大的生命舞台时将面临的现实。</p>
<hr>
<p>“It appears very likely that we will run out of at least some of our essential resources in the near future. How can human civilization continue if we do not receive technology and assistance from our neighbors in space?”</p>
<p>“看来我们很有可能在不久的将来至少会耗尽我们的一些基本资源。如果我们不从我们的太空邻居那里获得技术和援助，人类文明如何能够继续下去？”</p>
<p>If you seek to gain technology and assistance, you will be drawn into the persuasions, requirements and the commercial trade networks of other nations. They will limit your freedom. They will limit what you can do here on Earth. They will influence the kind of societies you will create in the future and will greatly limit the freedom allowed your citizens. You would give up so much for this technology and assistance. You do not yet realize what a great loss this would be and how much humanity would lose in the exchange.</p>
<p>如果你们寻求获得技术和援助，你们将被卷入其他国家的说服、要求和商业贸易网络。他们将限制你们的自由。他们将限制你们在地球上能做的事情。他们将会影响你们未来创建的社会结构，并极大限制你们公民的自由。为了获得这些技术和援助，你们将付出巨大的代价。你们尚未意识到这种交换会带来多大的损失，人类在交换中会失去多少。</p>
<p>You have enough here on Earth if humanity will govern itself wisely and if nations will cooperate sufficiently to preserve the resources of the world and to use them in a sustainable manner. You will need to build new technology, but even more than technology, you will need the will and the cooperation to do this.</p>
<p>如果人类能明智地管理自己，如果各国能充分合作以保护世界的资源并以可持续的方式使用它们，那你们在地球上就有足够的资源。你们将需要建立新的技术，但比技术更重要的是，你们将会需要意愿与合作来实现这个目标。</p>
<p>Over time, humanity will have to find beneficial and humane ways of limiting its population and limiting its consumption. It would be a very different world than the world you live in today, which is based upon the desire and the expectation of endless growth and expansion.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，人类必须找到有益和人道的方式来限制人口和消费。它将是一个与当今世界非常不同的世界，因为你们今天所生活的世界是建立在对无止境增长与扩张的渴望和期待之上的。</p>
<p>To be self-sufficient is one of the requirements for freedom. For humanity to be self-sufficient in this world would require a very different creation of society and a very different set of priorities for your leaders and your citizens.</p>
<p>自给自足是自由的要求之一。因为人类要在这个世界上自给自足，将需要一种非常不同的社会结构，以及对你们的领导人和公民有一套非常不同的优先事项。</p>
<p>What will bring about this great change but necessity itself? You are facing great change in the world—great environmental change, great change that all advancing technological societies have had to face or will have to face inevitably in their evolution. It is how you recognize and prepare for this, how you respond to this and what kind of society you build, whether it be free or repressive, that will determine the future of human existence in this world.</p>
<p>除了必要性本身，还有什么会带来这种伟大改变？你们正面临着世界的巨大变革——环境的巨大变化，这是所有先进技术社会在其进化过程中必然要面对的挑战。你们如何认识到这一点并为此做好准备，你们如何应对这一点，你们建立了一个什么样的社会，是自由的还是压抑的，这将决定人类在这个世界上生存的未来。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Are there many worlds such as ours in space?”</p>
<p>“在太空中有很多像我们这样的世界吗？”</p>
<p>There are many worlds that have been stripped of their natural resources and have become barren as a result. Certainly, terrestrial worlds such as yours are rare, maybe one out of five or six thousand planets contain the biological diversity that you enjoy and take for granted here in your world. That still accounts for many planets in the universe. But such planets are always occupied, are always valued and the native races always have to defend their rights, their privileges and their stewardship as they begin to emerge into the Greater Community.</p>
<p>有许多世界的自然资源已经被掠夺殆尽，变得荒芜。像你们这样的陆地世界是非常稀有的，也许五六千颗行星中只有一颗含有这种生物多样性，而你们在自己的世界里却享受着这种生物多样性，并认为这是理所当然的。这虽然仍然意味着宇宙中有很多这样的行星，但这些行星总是被占据的，总是备受珍视。本地种族在开始进入大社区时，总是要捍卫他们的权利、他们的特权和他们的管理权。</p>
<p>Terrestrial planets create biological hazards for visitors. And that is why colonization is usually attempted once the native race has either established a usable network that the visitors can use, such as is the case here on Earth, or have destroyed themselves through conflict and war, leaving an open door for intervention to occur, even military intervention. Military intervention is allowed in this region of space under such conditions. This represents part of the ethics of contact that are assumed and are practiced by many nations in this part of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>陆地行星会对来访者造成生物危害。因此，殖民通常是在原住种族已经建立起来访者可以利用的网络之后进行的，比如地球上的情况，或者是该种族通过冲突和战争自我毁灭，为干预甚至军事干预打开大门。在这样的情况下，军事干预在这片宇宙区域是被允许的。这代表了接触道德的一部分，这些道德是由大社区这部分的许多国家承担和实行的。</p>
<hr>
<p>“Many people conclude that the visitors are beneficial because they haven’t already attacked us and taken over. What would you say to this?”</p>
<p>“许多人认为，来访者是有益的，因为他们还没有攻击我们并接管地球。对此你怎么看？”</p>
<p>The Intervention is not here to attack humanity but to persuade humanity. The Intervention needs a compliant humanity to work for it and to engage with it to become part of its Collective. This assumption that humanity would be attacked and overtaken is entirely wrong. It is how you view gaining access to new lands and new resources.</p>
<p>干预并不是来攻击人类的，而是来说服人类的。干预需要顺从的人类为它工作，与它合作，成为它集体的一部分。这种认为人类会被攻击和征服的假设是完全错误的，这是一种将地球的观点套用在获取新领土和资源上的误解。</p>
<p>But even in your modern world, economic, more than military, forces are used to gain acquisition to resources, and this is what is happening to the world regarding its relations in space. You are encountering small, economic Collectives who are here to begin the process of acquisition that larger nations can assume later on, if the Intervention is successful in establishing its presence and its power in your world.</p>
<p>但是，即使在你们的现代世界中，经济力量也比军事力量更多地被用来获取资源，这就是世界在太空关系中正在发生的事情。你们遇到的是小型经济集体，他们在这里开始了获取资源的过程，如果干预成功地在你们的世界中建立了自己的存在和权力，那么以后就会有更大的国家用来获取资源。</p>
<p>To think that you would be attacked is wrong, and to think that because you have not been attacked that the forces that are here are beneficial is wrong. Both are based upon false assumptions. Therefore, the conclusions are incorrect.</p>
<p>认为你们会被攻击的想法是错误的，认为因为没有被攻击而相信这些力量是有益的也是错误的。这两种观点都基于错误的假设，因此得出的结论也是不正确的。</p>
<p>Humanity, living so long in isolation and being so warlike yourselves, is certainly likely to make such assumptions and to continue to believe in them and to uphold them. It is human ignorance that gives rise to such things, and human arrogance as well. For you may be preeminent in your own world, but you have no preeminence in the Greater Community, and you are not looked upon favorably by your nearest neighbors because of your warlike tendencies and destructive use of your environment.</p>
<p>人类长期过着与世隔绝的生活，本身又是如此好战，当然有可能做出这样的假设，并继续相信和坚持这些假设。正是人类的无知和傲慢导致了这些事情的发生。因为，你们在自己的世界里可能是出类拔萃的，但在大社区中，你们并无任何优势，而且由于你们的好战倾向和对环境的破坏性使用，你们并没有得到近邻的好感。</p>
<p>Those neighbors who are not free will look upon the freedoms that you have cultivated thus far with great anxiety and with great concern, not wanting these influences to be exerted within their own worlds. You have no idea what your music and your dance could evoke in such worlds and why they are viewed as a threat to those controlling powers that dominate them.</p>
<p>那些不自由的邻居会以极大的焦虑和担忧来看待你们迄今为止所培养的自由，不希望这些影响在他们自己的世界里产生。你们不知道你们的音乐和舞蹈在这些世界中可能引发什么样的反应，也不知道为什么这些音乐和舞蹈会被视为对主宰这些世界的控制势力的威胁。</p>
<hr>
<p>“How do free races maintain their autonomy and keep races that are not free from interfering?”</p>
<p>“自由的种族如何保持其自主性，并防止不自由的种族进行干预？”</p>
<p>Ah, this is the challenge! This is the challenge that awaits you if you are able to offset the Intervention that is occurring in the world today. The interest in your world will not cease, and attempts to influence you will continue. How would you keep such influences at bay? For free races living in larger neighborhoods of worlds that are not free, often this requires the signing of non-interference contracts, which stipulate generally that the free nations will not participate beyond their boundaries and areas or regions of influence. They will not try to exert or promote their freedom abroad. In exchange for this, other nations agree to stay out of their areas of influence and to not contact them directly.</p>
<p>啊，这就是挑战!这就是等待你们的挑战，如果你们能够抵消今天世界上正在发生的干预。对你们世界的兴趣不会停止，影响你们的企图也会继续。如何将这些影响排除在外呢？对于生活在不自由世界邻近区域的自由种族来说，这通常需要签订不干涉条约，通常规定自由国家不会参与其边界以外的事务，也不会在其他地区或影响范围之外推动他们的自由。作为交换，其他国家同意不进入他们的影响范围，也不直接与他们接触。</p>
<p>So various kinds of contracts like this are often made in highly inhabited regions of space, but such contracts are subject to change and reevaluation, and that is why the free nations do not travel beyond their districts or seek to promote freedom abroad. For that would violate their own autonomy and their own insulation from the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>因此，在人烟稠密的太空区域，常常会签订类似的条约，但这些条约可能会随着时间而改变和重新评估，这就是为什么自由国家不会走出自己的地区，也不会寻求在地区之外促进自由。因为这样做会侵犯他们自己的自治权和与大社区本身的隔离状态。</p>
<p>In areas where there is not a large concentration of nations, free nations will have to maintain their security through military means, aggressively challenging anyone who would come into their vicinity. This is less desirable, of course, but in sparsely populated regions in uncharted territories, this is definitely required. Everyone in the universe is looking for resources. Many in the universe want to have influence over other nations. Even in largely inhabited regions such as this, these desires and these needs continue.</p>
<p>在国家并不集中的地区，自由国家将不得不通过军事手段来维护自己的安全，咄咄逼人地挑战任何闯入其周边地区的存在。当然，这样做并不可取，但在人烟稀少的未知区域，这样做是绝对必要的。宇宙中的每个生命都在寻找资源。宇宙中的许多国家都想对其他国家施加影响。即使在像这样人口众多的地区，这些欲望和需求依然存在。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a tenuous balance that a free nation or a group of free nations must establish in order to keep the Greater Community out of their territories and to prevent the kind of intervention that is occurring in the world today.</p>
<p>因此，一个自由国家或一群自由国家必须建立一种脆弱的平衡，以便将大社区排除在他们的领土之外，并防止当今世界正在发生的这种干预。</p>
<p>Humanity still thinks the universe is a great empty place awaiting exploration, awaiting colonization, with infinite resources there for the taking, if only humanity can establish a sufficient technology to gain access to them. Yet these assumptions all stem from your isolation and your profound ignorance about the nature of life, commerce and interactions in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>人类仍然认为宇宙是一个巨大的空旷之地，等待着探索，等待着殖民，有无限的资源可以获取，只要人类能够建立足够的技术来获得它们。然而，这些假设都源于你们的孤立，以及你们对大社区的生命、商业和互动的性质的极度无知。</p>
<p>We understand this, and we do not condemn you for it, for we too had many of the same assumptions before contact with the Greater Community began for us, before intervention was attempted in our worlds. Since then, we have established greater autonomy, but it must be guarded carefully, both in the physical environment and in the mental environment.</p>
<p>我们理解这一点，我们也不会因此而谴责你们，因为在我们开始与大社区接触之前，在我们的世界受到干预之前，我们也曾抱有许多相同的假设。自那以后，我们已经建立了更大的自主权，但这种自主权必须在物质环境和心理环境中小心守护。</p>
<p>Other nations employ seers who try to see into our worlds, to see what kind of technology we are producing and to see where our power and our weakness reside. We must offset these intrusions in the mental environment with seers of our own, who are guided by Knowledge, who would obstruct this kind of intervention in the mental environment.</p>
<p>其他国家会雇佣预言家来窥探我们的世界，试图看到我们正在生产的技术，找出我们的力量和弱点所在。我们必须用我们自己的预言家来抵消这些对心理环境的入侵，这些预言家受内识的指导，会阻止这种对心理环境的干预。</p>
<p>This is all a new frontier to you and to human science and to human religion. Power in the mental environment in many ways can be equivalent to power in the physical environment, and the dangers and defenses that must be established here are significant. This is the price of freedom in the universe—constant vigilance, constant care and great responsibility.</p>
<p>这对你们的科学和宗教来说都是一个新的前沿。在许多方面，心理环境中的力量可以与物质环境中的力量相媲美，而这里的危险和防御措施同样重要。这就是宇宙中自由的代价——持续的警觉、持续的关注和伟大的责任。</p>
<hr>
<p>“You keep mentioning that Knowledge is the most powerful force in the universe. How can that be true when there are so many other powerful forces to deal with?”</p>
<p>“你们总是提到内识是宇宙中最强大的力量。当有这么多其他强大的力量需要处理时，这怎么可能是真的呢？”</p>
<p>Knowledge represents the power to see, to know and to act with certainty. It also represents the power to resist persuasion, deception and influence in the mental environment. The individual or the nation that has this strength has the power to resist intervention and to comprehend the intentions and the activities of other nations who might be threatening to its freedom or existence.</p>
<p>内识代表了看见、知道和确定行动的力量。它也代表了在心理环境中抵制说服、欺骗和影响的力量。拥有这种力量的个人或国家，有能力抵制干预，并理解可能威胁其自由或生存的其他国家的意图和活动。</p>
<p>It is the ultimate form of intelligence, you see, and seers who are guided by Knowledge are more powerful than seers who are not. Here you are able to discern the future and future events before they happen, with varying degrees of accuracy. Here you are able to discern the intentions of others and the capabilities of others without the use of technology. Here you can pretend to be weak when in fact you are really strong. Here you can appear to be non-aggressive when in fact you can be incisive in your inquiries. Here you can be well protected and well defended without requiring a great military force or infrastructure. Here you can make wise decisions regarding your relations with other nations even if their intentions are questionable or uncertain. Here you can engage in diplomacy with other nations with far more certainty than you would have otherwise.</p>
<p>这是一种终极形式的智能。你看，受到内识引导的预言家比那些没有这种引导的预言家更强大。在这里，你能够在未来和未来的事件发生之前，凭借不同程度的准确性洞察未来。在这里，你能够洞察他人的意图和能力，而不需要依赖技术。在这里，你可以假装软弱，而实际上却是强大的。在这里，你可以表现得不具攻击性，但实际上你可以问得精辟透彻。在这里，不需要强大的军事力量或基础设施，你就可以得到很好的保护和防御。在这里，即使其他国家的意图令人怀疑或不确定，你也能就与其他国家的关系做出明智的决定。在这里，你可以与其他国家进行外交活动，其确定性远远超过你在其他情况下所拥有的。</p>
<p>It is this power and this Knowledge that humanity will need if it is to gain the strength and commitment to establish greater unity amongst its nations and the wise and sustaining use of the world. This will overcome greed and avarice. This will overcome competition, conflict and war. This will overcome grievance and hatred and inequality.</p>
<p>人类需要这种力量和内识，才能获得足够的力量和决心，在各国之间建立更大的团结，并明智地、可持续地使用世界的资源。这样可以战胜贪婪和贪欲，克服竞争、冲突和战争，也能够战胜怨恨、仇恨和不平等。</p>
<p>That is why Knowledge is the greatest power in the universe. It is a power that the Intervention is not using, or it would not be here engaged in the activities it is undertaking. This is the power that will give humanity the power to offset intervention and to prevent future interventions. This is the power to give humanity the stability to establish a new world with far greater equanimity and equality, justice and freedom.</p>
<p>这就是为什么内识是宇宙中最伟大的力量。这是一种干预没有使用的力量，否则它就不会在这里从事它正在进行的活动。正是这种力量，它将赋予人类抵消干预并防止未来干预的力量。这种力量将赋予人类稳定性，以建立一个全新的世界，拥有更大的平静、平等、公正和自由。</p>
<p>Think upon these things.</p>
<p>请思考这些事情。</p>
