<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on February 25, 2008 in Boulder, CO<br>2008年2月25日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a certain point, you will come to realize that this New Revelation is here to give you a new life. It is not simply to make improvements, or to sweeten it with a sense of spiritual meaning, or to condone your thoughts and beliefs or past actions with some kind of blessing from above.</p>
<p>在某个时刻，你会意识到这个新启示是为了给你一个新的生命。它不是简单地进行改进，或用一种精神意义的感觉使之甜美，或用某种来自上面的祝福来宽恕你的感想、信仰或过去的行为。</p>
<p>At some point, you come to realize that the life you are living really is not appropriate for you. It is a compromise. And the compromise has been too great. It has been too thorough. It is a compromise with how you regard yourself, how you regard others and how you regard the world. And though this realization may be resisted, maybe it will be denied and further compromises will be sought, in actuality, it represents the beginning of a great hope for you.</p>
<p>在某些时刻，你会意识到你所过的生命确实不适合你。它是一种妥协。而这种妥协已经太大了。它已经太彻底。它是对你如何看待自己、如何看待他人和如何看待世界的妥协。尽管这个认知可能会被抵制，也许会被否认，并且会寻求进一步的妥协，但实际上，它代表了你伟大希望的开始。</p>
<p>For God knows that without Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence that has been placed within you, you would live a life of compromise. You would seek compromise for security, for approval, for wealth and advantage. You would seek compromise in order to avoid ridicule or criticism or condemnation or even social rejection. Compromise would permeate everything—your beliefs, your attitudes, your aspirations, your activities, your plans, your goals. This would increase to a point where you really had lost contact with who and what you are.</p>
<p>因为上帝知道，如果没有内识，如果没有放置在你内心深处的更深层次的智能，你将过着一种妥协的生命。你会为了安全、为了认可、为了财富和利益而寻求妥协。你会寻求妥协，以避免嘲笑、批评或谴责，甚至社会的排斥。妥协将渗透到一切——你的信仰、你的态度、你的愿望、你的活动、你的计划、你的目标。这将增加到一个地步，导致你彻底失去对你是谁以及你是什么的联系。</p>
<p>Now you have become a product of your society, a product of the expectations of society and a product of your own personal thinking. But you have lost contact with the deeper thread and meaning of your life. And even if you are successful and achieve your goals, it will be empty, and the joy will be short lived, and they will come at a great price of time, energy and effort. And the rewards will be momentary and fleeting.</p>
<p>现在你已经成为社会的产物，成为社会期望的产物，成为你个人思想的产物。但你已经失去了与你生命中更深层次的线索和意义的联系。即使你获得成功，实现了你的目标，那也是空虚的，快乐也是短暂的，而且这些成就将以大量的时间、精力和努力为代价。而这些回报也将是短暂的，转瞬即逝的。</p>
<p>This realization, which is so denied and avoided, is the beginning of a greater promise for you. Do not resist it. Do not argue against it. Do not complain that you may have to make great changes in your life. Of course you will because you are being given a new life—not a slightly better rendition of your old life, not simply new scenery or new faces or new forms of stimulation. This is not a cosmetic change. This is a change of a far greater importance and depth and meaning for you.</p>
<p>这种被如此否认和回避的认知，是你更伟大承诺的开始。不要抵制它。不要反对它。不要抱怨你可能不得不在你的生命中做出的巨大改变。你当然会这样做，因为你被赋予了一种新的生命——不是对你的旧生命稍作改进的演绎，不是简单的新风景或新面孔或新形式的刺激。这不是一个表面上的变化。这是一个对你来说更重要、更深刻、更有意义的改变。</p>
<p>This is the kind of change your heart has been yearning for for so long, for such a long time have you been laboring. And now it seems to come to nothing. It seems you have failed the expectations of your culture. You might even feel you are a failure, that you have not fulfilled the goals and expectations of your family, your culture and even your religion. But in this seeming failure is a promise of a greater success. The old life must fail you, or you must fail it, in order to have this new opportunity, this opening in your life, this new beginning.</p>
<p>这是你内心渴望已久的改变，你为之努力了如此之久。而现在，这一切似乎都成了泡影。你似乎辜负了文化对你的期望。你甚至会觉得自己是个失败者，没有实现家庭、文化甚至宗教的目标和期望。但在这看似失败的过程中，却蕴含着一种更大成功的承诺。旧的生命必须使你失败，或者说你必须让旧的生命失败，这样你才能获得新的机会，你生命中的这个开端，这个新的起点。</p>
<p>Many people simply want to have revelation as if it is some kind of appendage to their old life, [as if] spirituality is like a seasoning to the tastelessness of their life. It is something they are going to add on. Now they are going to be spiritual and do spiritual things and think spiritual thoughts and do activities that look edifying and uplifting.</p>
<p>许多人只是想拥有启示，好像启示是他们旧生命的某种附属品，[好像]精神性就像他们生命中无味的调味品。这是他们要添加的东西。现在，他们要做属灵的人，做属灵的事，思考属灵的思想，参与那些看起来有益和鼓舞人心的活动。</p>
<p>But again, this is all for approval. This is all to try to seek more pleasure, more comfort and more security. The motivation for it is no different from the motivation that guides one to seek wealth and pleasure and escape from life. It is not authentic. As a result, it does not yield an authentic result. We are speaking of something very different here.</p>
<p>但同样，这都是为了得到认可。这都是为了试图寻求更多的快乐、更多的舒适和更多的安全。它的动机与指导人们寻求财富和快乐以及逃避生命的动机没有什么不同。它不是真实的。因此，它不会产生一个真实的结果。我们在这里说的是非常不同的生命。</p>
<p>This new life, you do not know what it means yet. You do not know what it will look like yet because it is new. It is not your invention. It is not what you are accustomed to. And so you begin to turn this corner very slowly.</p>
<p>这种新生命，你还不知道它意味着什么。你还不知道它将是什么样子，因为它是新的。它不是你的发明。它不是你所习惯的。因此，你开始非常缓慢地转过这个角落。</p>
<p>Even if there are major events in your life that have brought this awareness to you, the journey has many steps to allow you time to learn and to adapt and to gain a deeper foundation of confidence within yourself so that your life may become inner directed as opposed to being outer directed, that you may become a person of power, strength and integrity instead of someone who is mimicking the values of their culture.</p>
<p>即使在你的生命中发生了一些重大事件，使你有了这种觉知，这个旅程也有许多步骤，让你有时间学习和适应，并在你的内心深处获得一种更深层次的自信基础，以便你的生命可以变得由内而外，你可以成为一个有能力、有力量和完整性的人，而不是一个模仿其文化价值观的人。</p>
<p>Here many things will have to be learned anew. They will have to be re-evaluated. Many of your thoughts will have to be reconsidered. Many of your firmly held beliefs will have to be questioned, and in some cases even set aside. This is the price of freedom. This is the price one pays for having the opportunity to live a greater life, an authentic life, a life that is in keeping with Knowledge within [oneself], a life that fulfills the destiny that [one was] sent into the world to fulfill.</p>
<p>在这里，许多事情都必须重新学习。它们将不得不被重新评估。你的许多想法将不得不被重新考虑。你的许多坚定信念将不得不受到质疑，在某些情况下甚至被搁置。这就是自由的代价。这是一个人为了有机会过上更伟大的生命而付出的代价，一个真实的生命，一个与[自己]内心深处的内识相一致的生命，一个完成[自己]被派到世界上所要完成天命的生命。</p>
<p>Until this turning point, you are only half alive. Yes, your heart is beating, and the blood is flowing through your veins, and your senses are reporting the world around you, and you are going through the motions of your life, meeting responsibilities and obligations and trying to seek some form of pleasure or reprieve. But it is an empty existence. The real meaning and value of your life has not yet been discovered.</p>
<p>在这个转折点之前，你只是一半活着。是的，你的心脏在跳动，血液在血管中流动，你的感官在报告你周围的世界，你在体验你的生命，履行责任和义务，试图寻求某种形式的快乐或缓和。但这是一种空洞的存在。你生命的真正意义和价值还没有被发现。</p>
<p>Up until this point, Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you to guide and protect you, will try to keep you from harm, will try to keep you and hold you back from making serious and long-lasting mistakes and commitments that will be in opposition to your ability to discover and to live a greater life in the future.</p>
<p>直到此时，内识，上帝放置在你内心深处指导你和保护你的更深层次的智能，会试图让你免受伤害，它会试图阻止你，使你无法犯下严重而持久的错误，做出与你未来发现和过上更伟大生命的能力相悖的承诺。</p>
<p>Here at this earlier stage Knowledge will seem latent within you, but really it is still trying to keep you out of trouble and to prevent you from giving your life away to another or to situations or to places, to people—to keep your life open.</p>
<p>在这个早期阶段，内识似乎潜伏在你的内心深处，但实际上，它仍在努力使你远离麻烦，防止你把自己的生命交给他人、环境、地方或人，以保持你生命的开放性。</p>
<p>Many people are in this earlier stage, of course. The emergence has not happened for them yet. When it will happen and how it will happen and even if it will happen is something that you cannot tell. It is a mystery.</p>
<p>当然，许多人处于这个早期阶段。内识的出现还没有发生。它何时发生，如何发生，甚至是否会发生，都是你无法判断的。它是一个谜。</p>
<p>You see, before this emergence, you really are just building a foundation to become a functional person in the world. You are building life skills. You are experiencing the pleasures and the pains of this world. You are seeking pleasure and avoiding pain and finding disappointment along the way.</p>
<p>你看，在内识出现之前，你真的只是在建立一个基础，成为这个世界上一个有用的人。你正在建立生活技能。你正在体验这个世界的快乐和痛苦。你在寻求快乐，避免痛苦，并发现一路上的失望。</p>
<p>This early preparation can be extremely important for what you will be able to realize, to accomplish and to communicate to others in the future. Even the most foolish mistakes you will make in this early phase can be very important in giving you wisdom—teaching you what is real, to value what is real, to help you discern what is good from what only looks good, to help you to discern your real inclinations from those impulses that represent your weakness and insecurity.</p>
<p>这种早期准备对于你将来能够实现什么、取得什么成就以及向他人传达什么都是极其重要的。即使是你在这个早期阶段会犯的最愚蠢的错误，也会在赋予你智慧方面起到非常重要的作用——教导你什么是真实，来珍惜真实的价值，帮助你辨别什么是好的，什么只是表面上看起来好的，帮助你辨别你真正的倾向，以及那些代表你的弱点和不安全感的冲动。</p>
<p>Perhaps in this earlier stage you will feel there is a Presence watching over you at times. You will sense that there is a Presence with you. And you will think from time to time that there probably is something greater for you to do in your life. But the realization has not really struck yet. It has not really rocked your foundation. It is only something you think about at the level of your intellect. It has not really penetrated your heart.</p>
<p>也许在这个较早的阶段，你会感觉到有一个存在时常在注视着你。你会感觉到有一个存在与你同在。而且你会不时地想到，在你的生命中可能有更伟大的事情要你去做。但是，这种认知还没有真正被打动。它还没有真正动摇你的根基。它只是你在智力层面上思考的想法。它还没有真正渗透到你的内心。</p>
<p>Your failures and your disillusionment here hold great promise for you. Your disappointment in yourself and in others and in the great pleasures for which you have paid such a great price—this paves the way for this realization. And this realization will not simply be a fleeting moment. It will be something that will change the course of your life. And you will not understand what has happened to you or the nature and purpose of the change until you have traveled afar in the second stage of your journey.</p>
<p>你在这里的失败和幻灭为你带来了伟大的承诺。你对自己和他人的失望，以及对你为之付出巨大代价的巨大快乐的失望——这些都为你的领悟铺平了道路。而这种领悟将不仅仅是一个短暂的时刻。它将会改变你的生命轨迹。而你不会理解发生在你身上的事情，也不会理解这种改变的性质和目的，直到你在第二阶段的旅程中走得很远。</p>
<p>The guidelines for how to live that will be given here relate to this second stage of the journey of your life. They do not really refer to people who have not passed through this great threshold, who have not experienced this turning point. To them it will seem beneficial, but confusing. It will seem restraining. It will challenge their idea of freedom. It will seem to require too much effort and responsibility because they are not yet ready to make this effort or to assume this responsibility.</p>
<p>这里所提供的生活指南是针对生命旅程的第二阶段而言的。它们并不真正适用于那些没有迈过这个伟大门槛、没有经历过这个转折点的人。对他们来说，这似乎是有益的，但却令人困惑。它似乎是一种限制。它将挑战他们对自由的想法。它似乎需要太多的努力和责任，因为他们还没有准备好做出这种努力或承担这种责任。</p>
<p>They are still trying to get out of life what they want. Beyond their basic needs, they are trying to get out of life what they want. They do not yet realize that they were sent into the world for a purpose. They have no memory of their Ancient Home, and so they think this life is all important, it is everything. They want to live for the moment, for themselves. So it is a very different awareness that one begins to gain after this great threshold. The guidelines for living here become not only helpful but essential for success.</p>
<p>他们仍在试图从生命中获得他们想要的东西。除了他们的基本需求之外，他们还试图从生命中获得更多。他们还没有意识到，他们被派到这个世界上是有目的的。他们对自己的古老家园没有记忆，因此他们认为这个生命是至关重要的，它是一切。他们想要活在当下、为自己而活。因此，在跨越这个伟大门槛之后，人们开始获得一种非常不同的觉知。在这里生活的指导方针不仅变得有帮助，而且对于成功来说是必不可少的。</p>
<p>The first requirement is to accept the great change that is happening and to leave the explanation open. You will not be able to understand it. Your intellect is referenced to your past and former life. It cannot account for what is occurring with you now and for the impulses that you feel now and for the orientation that is slowly emerging within you. Your intellect will try but will be unsuccessful at comprehending the meaning of this.</p>
<p>第一个要求是接受正在发生的巨大变化，并留下解释的余地。你将无法理解它。你的智力是以你的过去和以前的生命为参照的。它无法解释现在发生在你身上的事情，无法解释你现在感受到的冲动，也无法解释在你内心深处慢慢出现的方向。你的智力会尝试，但无法成功理解其中的含义。</p>
<p>Some people try to go backwards here. They want to go back to whatever they thought gave them a sense of security and stability and self-assurance. But unfortunately they have gone too far now, for those attempts will be seen as empty, only pulling them back to a former life that they found to be unfulfilling—lacking in meaning, purpose and value. Now they are embarking on a new kind of journey, and they cannot define it.</p>
<p>有些人试图在这里往回走。他们想回到他们认为能给他们带来安全感、稳定感和自我保证的地方。但不幸的是，他们现在已经走得太远了，因为这些尝试将被视为是空洞的，只会把他们拉回到以前的生命，他们发现这种生命是不满足的——缺乏意义、目的和价值。现在，他们正踏上一段新的旅程，但他们却无法定义这段旅程。</p>
<p>Therefore, allow this change to occur. Do not try to define it. Do not even use ideas from other spiritual traditions to try to define it. Allow it to be a mystery, for to you it will be a mystery.</p>
<p>因此，允许这种变化发生。不要试图去定义它。甚至不要使用来自其他精神传统的想法来试图定义它。允许它成为一个谜，因为对你来说它将是一个神秘。</p>
<p>Mystery exists beyond the realm of the intellect. Honor this. Accept this. The Mystery is now beginning to emerge in your life, whereas before it was held back. Before, there was nowhere in your life for it to come forth—to guide you, to bless you and to prepare you. Now the Mystery is beginning to emerge. Let this happen.</p>
<p>神秘的存在超越了智力的领域。尊重这一点。接受这一点。现在，神秘开始在你的生命中显现，而之前它被压制着。在此之前，你的生命中没有地方可以让它出现——来引导你、祝福你并为你做准备。现在，神秘正在开始显现。让这一切发生。</p>
<p>You will become confused about what to do regarding your relationships with people primarily, and secondarily your relationship with where you live, the work that you do, your activities, your hobbies, your interests and so forth. Let this confusion exist. It is healthy. It is natural. It is part of the transition.</p>
<p>你会变得困惑，不知道该如何处理你与人的关系，其次是你与你居住的地方、你做的工作、你的活动、你的爱好、你的兴趣等等的关系。让这种困惑存在吧。它是健康的。它是自然的。它是过渡的一部分。</p>
<p>You are building a bridge to a new life. You are not yet fully living that new life. You are building a bridge. You are in transition. Transitions are confusing because you are moving from one understanding to another understanding, from one experience of life to another experience of life. The transitions mean that you cannot go back, and you have not gone far enough to go fully forward, so you have to be on this bridge, going through this transition.</p>
<p>你正在建立一座通往新生命的桥梁。你还没有完全过上这种新的生命。你正在建造一座桥梁。你正处于过渡期。过渡是令人困惑的，因为你正从一种理解转向另一种理解，从一种生命体验转向另一种生命体验。过渡意味着你不能回头，你还没有走得足够远，不能完全向前走，所以你必须在这座桥上，经历这个过渡。</p>
<p>Leave your future open. Set aside plans beyond what you must do to simply maintain yourself in the world. Here you must have trust that clarity will come, and clarity will come when you feel you are prepared to move forward and are willing to move forward into new territory.</p>
<p>为自己的未来留有余地。在你必须做的事情之外，预留出计划，以便简单地在这个世界上维持你自己。在这里，你必须有信任，清晰会到来，当你觉得你准备好向前迈进并愿意向新的领域迈进时，清晰就会到来。</p>
<p>As long as you hesitate, the clarity will not come. As long as you are bargaining and trying to work out some kind of deal to keep something from your old life, the certainty will not come. The clarity will not come because you have not yet turned that corner. It is like the answer is around the side of the mountain, and you have to go around that mountain to find it.</p>
<p>只要你犹豫不决，清晰就不会到来。只要你在讨价还价，试图达成某种交易以保留你过去生命中的一些关系，确定性就不会到来。清晰感不会到来，因为你还没有转过这个弯。它就像答案在山的一侧，而你必须绕过这座山才能找到它。</p>
<p>This is confusing for the intellect. But now the intellect must yield to a greater power within you, the power that God has put within you to guide you and to bless you and to prepare you for this greater life. You will still have to be very responsible in what you do and what you commit yourself to, in what you assign yourself to in life, in how you use your time and energy and so forth, but there is something greater moving in you now.</p>
<p>这对智力来说是混乱的。但是，现在智力必须屈服于你内心深处的更伟大力量，它是上帝放置在你内心深处，来引导你、祝福你、为这个更伟大的生命做准备的力量。你仍然必须在你所做的事情和你所承诺的事情上非常负责任，包括你在生命中选择承担的角色，在你如何使用你的时间和能量等等方面，但现在有更伟大的内识在你内心流动。</p>
<p>Next, do not go tell all your friends and family, for they will not understand. Unless one of them has turned this corner, they will think you are being foolish, or they will think that something bad has happened to you, or that you have been influenced by something that they are suspicious of. They might even think that you have gone mad.</p>
<p>接下来，不要去告诉你所有的朋友和家人，因为他们不会理解。除非他们中有人转过这个弯，否则他们会认为你很愚蠢，或者他们会认为你发生了什么坏事，或者你被他们怀疑的东西所影响。他们甚至可能认为你已经疯了。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must keep this new experience to yourself as much as possible. If you are fortunate, there will be one person, either within your family currently or someone you will meet who will give you a sign to move forward.</p>
<p>因此，你必须尽可能地把这种新的体验留给你自己。如果你幸运的话，会有一个人，或者是你目前的家人，或者是你将遇到的人，他们会给你一个前进的信号。</p>
<p>You will want to share your new experiences and the strangeness and the wonder of those thoughts and ideas that are coming to you, and of the change that you are feeling that is liberating you from the past. But you must be very careful who you share this with, for others will not understand. And their lack of understanding and their criticism and condemnation will really hurt you and rob you of confidence.</p>
<p>你会想要分享你的新体验，分享那些正在向你涌来的感想以及想法所带来的陌生感和惊奇，以及你所感受到的从过去解放出来的变化。但你必须非常小心地与他人分享，因为其他人不会理解。而他们的不理解、批评和谴责会真正伤害你，并剥夺你的信心。</p>
<p>To move from being an outer-directed person to being an inner-directed person is a tremendous change, and you will feel very shaky at first. You will not feel very strong. You will be very uncertain of what you are doing. You will be like the little tender shoot in the great forest that must be protected until it gains enough strength to stand upon its own.</p>
<p>从一个外在导向的人转变为一个内在导向的人，是一个极大的变化，一开始你会感到非常颤抖。你将不会感到非常强大。你会对你正在做的事情感到非常不确定。你会像大森林里的小嫩芽一样，必须得到保护，直到它获得足够的力量，可以独立站立。</p>
<p>So there are dangers at this beginning, at this early part of your journey. Premature conclusions, indiscretion with others, self-doubt, the attempt to try to define your life—all these things are dangers because they can prevent you from proceeding onward. And once this journey begins, you must proceed onward. That is so important. Imagine that you are climbing a great mountain, well, once you begin to gain a little altitude, you do not want to have to go back. You need to go forward.</p>
<p>因此，在这个开始，在你旅程的这个早期部分，有一些危险。过早的结论、对他人的轻率、自我怀疑、试图定义你的生命——所有这些都是危险，因为它们会阻止你继续前进。而一旦这个旅程开始，你必须继续前进。这一点非常重要。想象一下，你正在攀登一座大山，好吧，一旦你开始获得一点高度，你就不想再走回头路了。你需要向前走。</p>
<p>The Knowledge that God has placed within you will urge you to go onward, to keep your eyes open, your ears open, to be very watchful, to be very careful. Do not think that God is going to protect you now from every form of harm, and prevent injury and disappointment and tragedy for you. You must be very careful. This is part of gaining a greater awareness.</p>
<p>上帝放置在你内心深处的内识会敦促你继续前进，睁大你的眼睛，打开你的耳朵，要非常警惕，非常小心。不要认为上帝现在会保护你免受各种形式的伤害，防止你受伤、失望和悲剧的发生。你必须非常小心。这是获得更大觉知的一部分。</p>
<p>Previously, you were not careful. You were reckless. You were foolish, impulsive. Now you must become watchful, discerning, patient, careful. In doing this, you will see how you have been wasting your life, your time, your energy, over meaningless pursuits and over thinking that would never lead to resolution; and self-doubt, self-recrimination, judgment of others and the immensely superficial conversation that most people continue to maintain around you.</p>
<p>以前，你并不小心。你是鲁莽的。你是愚蠢的，冲动的。现在，你必须变得警惕、有辨别力、有耐心、谨慎。在这样做的过程中，你将看到你是如何浪费你的生命、你的时间、你的精力，浪费在无意义的追求和永远不会导致解决的思考上；以及自我怀疑、自我责备、对他人的评判和大多数人继续在你周围保持的无比肤浅的谈话。</p>
<p>Next, you must gather your resources and conserve your energy so that you have time to be alone, to learn to be still and to listen. You will seek quiet now more than stimulation. You will find that the social activities around you will be aggravating and irritating to you, for you need something else now. You need to listen. You need to be quiet. You need to gain a greater connection to this emerging power within yourself.</p>
<p>接下来，你必须收集你的资源，保存你的能量，以便你有时间独处，学会静止和倾听。你现在将寻求安静而不是刺激。你会发现，你周围的社交活动会让你感到委屈和恼怒，因为你现在需要别的东西。你需要倾听。你需要安静。你需要获得与自己里面这种新兴力量的更大联系。</p>
<p>This will change your priorities. This will change your desires. This will affect your decisions. And you will find that you will no longer be interested in doing things with other people that you did before. Things which were never really very fulfilling, now you will just want to avoid. You will see their emptiness, and you will not want them, and they will be an aggravation to you. And the pettiness and superficiality of people’s conversations, and their habitual condemnation of others, you will find to be aggravating.</p>
<p>这将改变你的优先事项。这将改变你的欲望。这将影响你的决定。而且你会发现，你将不再对与其他人一起做的事情感兴趣，而你以前也是如此。那些从来没有真正满足的事情，现在你只想避免。你会看到他们的空虚，你会不想要他们，他们会成为你的负担。人们谈话中的琐碎和肤浅，以及他们对他人的习惯性谴责，你会发现是一种伤害。</p>
<p>This is natural. This is what it means to come home to yourself, to find your real values, your real priorities, your natural inclinations as opposed to everything that has been conditioned into you. You will seek time away from other people. You will seek time alone. You will not want to have constant stimulation. You will need the confidence to do this. Most people cannot sit still for more than five seconds before they are driven out of themselves again. Here you must sit and listen. Gaze at nature. Listen to the sounds of the world, the natural world.</p>
<p>这是很自然的。这就是回到自己身边的意思，找到你真正的价值，你真正的优先事项，你的自然倾向，而不是一切被灌输给你的条件。你将寻求远离其他人的时间。你将寻求独处的时间。你将不希望有持续的刺激。你将需要有信心做到这一点。大多数人不能静坐超过五秒钟，就会再次被赶出自己。在这里，你必须坐下来倾听。凝视着大自然。聆听世界的声音，自然界的声音。</p>
<p>You will see here how your energy—your mental energy and your physical energy—have been misappropriated in the past, and you will want to conserve them, for you need them now. You are gathering your strength. You are gathering your resources. You are not throwing your life away. You want to plug up all the holes where your ship is leaking, where you are losing ground to others or to situations—through habit or through the designs of others.</p>
<p>你将在这里看到你的能量——你的精神能量和你的身体能量——在过去是如何被挪用的，你将想要保存它们，因为你现在需要它们。你正在收集你的力量。你正在收集你的资源。你不是在丢弃你的生命。你想堵住所有你的船漏水的洞，堵住你因习惯或因他人的设计而输给他人或情况的地方。</p>
<p>The New Message will speak to you here, for it is imbued with the Power and the Mystery of God. And it is this Power and Mystery that are drawing you now. For what is really happening in your life is God is moving in you. God is moving you.</p>
<p>新讯息将在这里对你说话，因为它充满了上帝的力量和神秘。而现在正是这种力量和神秘在吸引你。因为在你的生命中真正发生的事情是上帝在你里面运动。上帝正在移动你。</p>
<p>But this movement is a freedom from things at the outset. You have to disengage. You cannot take an old life into a new life, and so you are going through an incremental disengagement. Part of this disengagement is physical. It has to do with your activities and involvements with others. But much of it is internal. It is your ideas. It is your compulsions. It is what you think you should do, who you think you should be, what you should have or how you should be with others. For this is where the social conditioning really takes place.</p>
<p>但这种运动在一开始就是对事物的一种自由。你必须脱离。你不能把旧生命带入新生命，所以你正在经历一个渐进的脱离。这种脱离的一部分是身体上的。它与你的活动和与他人的关系有关。但大部分是内在的。它是你的想法。它是你的强迫症。它是你认为你应该做什么，你认为你应该是谁，你应该拥有什么或你应该如何与他人相处。因为这是社会调节真正发生的地方。</p>
<p>And every day you move forward, you break these chains. They have less and less power over you. As you move up the mountain, the draw and the attraction of the lowlands are left behind, and you become freer and lighter and less burdened with the expectations of others and with your own needs that were never genuine to begin with.</p>
<p>而你前进的每一天，你都在打破这些枷锁。它们对你的影响力越来越小。当你往上爬的时候，低地的吸引力就会被抛在后面，你会变得更自由、更轻盈，对他人的期望和自己的需求的负担也会更少，而这些需求从一开始就不是真正的。</p>
<p>During this time, limit your exposure to the media. Do not read a lot of books. Do not go to movies unless they are really inspirational, for you are gathering your strength. You are calling your strength to you. You are conserving your energy. You are paying attention to the inside now more than to the outside. You are moving away from the racket of the world. Allow this. Follow this. Strengthen this. For this is a natural inclination.</p>
<p>在这段时间，限制你对媒体的接触。不要阅读大量的书籍。不要去看电影，除非是真正鼓舞人心的电影，因为你正在聚集你的力量。你在召唤你的力量。你在保存你的能量。你现在关注内心比关注外部更多。你正在远离世界的喧嚣。允许这一点。遵循这一点。加强这一点。因为这是一种自然的倾向。</p>
<p>If there are longstanding friendships and they cannot follow you now, you will have to let them go, lovingly. They will fall away from you, for they cannot go this far up the mountain yet. You are going further than they can go yet. You have turned a corner they have not turned.</p>
<p>如果有长期的友谊，而他们现在不能跟随你，你将不得不让他们离开，充满爱意地。他们会离你而去，因为他们还不能在山上走这么远。你正在走得比他们能走的更远。你已经转过了一个他们没有转过的角落。</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in the early stages is people’s obligation to others—to their friends, their family. The only exception to this obligation is the raising of your children, which you must do until they reach adulthood. But to all others, your relationship is now put into doubt. There are circumstances where you will have to care for an elderly or infirm parent, and that is appropriate. But beyond this, you are building your allegiance to God, and that will challenge your allegiance to others and their hold upon you. For many people, this is the most difficult challenge, the first great threshold in their preparation.</p>
<p>在早期阶段，最困难的事情是人们对他人的义务——他们的朋友，他们的家人。这种义务的唯一例外是养育你的孩子，你必须做到这一点，直到他们长大成人。但对所有其他人来说，你的关系现在被置疑了。在有些情况下，你将不得不照顾年老或体弱的父母，这是很恰当的。但除此之外，你正在建立你对上帝的忠诚，这将挑战你对其他人的忠诚以及他们对你的控制。对许多人来说，这是最困难的挑战，是他们准备工作中的第一个大门槛。</p>
<p>Do not explain yourself to others. Just say that there are deeper currents in your life and you are trying to follow them. There is deeper movement within your heart and you are trying to follow that. Tell them that you need time alone, time of quiet, time of retreat, time of re-evaluation. And do not feel you must respond to their persistent questions. You do not have to give them answers. Spare yourself the agony of trying to do this.</p>
<p>不要向他人解释你自己。你只需说，你的生命中有更深层次的潮流，你正在努力追随它们。在你的内心深处有更深层次的运动，你正在努力追随它。告诉他们，你需要独处的时间，安静的时间，撤退的时间，重新评估的时间。不要觉得你必须回应他们喋喋不休的问题。你没有必要给他们答案。不要让自己承受尝试这样做的痛苦。</p>
<p>At some point, it will be necessary for you to begin to study the pathway that the New Message has provided: to take the Steps to Knowledge, to read the Wisdom from the Greater Community and to learn about Greater Community Spirituality. This will be like food to you, food for your heart, food for your soul.</p>
<p>在某些时候，你有必要开始研究新讯息所提供的途径：开展内识的进阶，阅读来自大社区的智慧，学习大社区的精神性。这对你来说就像食物一样，是你内心的食物，是你灵魂的食物。</p>
<p>You will need this now because this will give you strength and will confirm the greater movement of your life. It will give it greater clarity, greater definition, and will show you that this corner that you have turned represents your destiny and is not simply an accident in life. It is life itself, moving within you now. And the New Message will resonate with your deeper nature, a nature that is now slowly emerging within you. And this will bring new people into your life, people who also are turning a corner and have begun a greater journey.</p>
<p>你现在就需要这样做，因为这将给你力量，并确认你生命的更伟大运动。它将使你的生命更加清晰，更加明确，并向你表明，你所转过的这个弯代表了你的天命，而不仅仅是生命中的一个意外。它是生命本身，现在就在你的内心深处运动。而新讯息将与你更深层次的自然产生共鸣，这种自然现在正在你内心深处慢慢显现。这将为你的生命带来新的人，他们也在转角处，开始了更伟大的旅程。</p>
<p>It is important here that you not have firm beliefs. You do not need to accept firm beliefs. You are looking for a deeper experience now. The experience will be your foundation, not firm beliefs. You are escaping firm beliefs. You are venturing into a greater realm of revelation and natural experience. Everyone at the bottom of the mountain is entertaining firm beliefs, but firm beliefs do not enable you to get up this mountain and do not enable you to gain a higher elevation where you can see the truth of life around you as it will become evident.</p>
<p>这里很重要的一点是，你不要有坚定的信仰。你不需要接受坚定的信仰。你现在正在寻找一种更深层次的体验。体验将是你的基础，而不是坚定的信仰。你正在逃离坚定的信仰。你正在冒险进入一个更伟大的启示和自然体验的领域。在山下的每个人都在接受坚定的信仰，但是，坚定的信仰并不能让你登上这座山，并不能让你站在更高的地方，在这里你可以看到你周围生命的真理，因为它将变得显而易见。</p>
<p>Do not adopt firm beliefs. If you feel insecure, if you are unsure of yourself, it is fine; it is natural. Let the explanation be open. Do not attach yourself to a whole new set of beliefs. That is like going from one prison cell to another. Oh, it is a new place, but it is the same condition. Oh, it is new and exciting and reassuring, but it is the same old condition.</p>
<p>不要采用坚定的信仰。如果你感到不安全，如果你对自己没有信心，没有关系；这是自然的。让解释变得开放。不要将自己固定在一整套新的信仰上。它就像是从一个监狱牢房转移到另一个牢房。哦，这是一个新的地方，但条件却是一样的。哦，它是新的、令人兴奋的和令人安心的，但它是同样的旧条件。</p>
<p>Allow the steps to reveal to you what the journey really is. It is not a journey that is understood by theorists or pundits or philosophers, idealists, academics or the general public. It is more of a mystical path, a deeper journey.</p>
<p>允许这些步骤向你揭示旅程的真谛。它不是一个理论家、评论家、哲学家、理想主义者、学者或公众能够理解的旅程。它更像是一条神秘的道路，一段更深层次的旅程。</p>
<p>Its revelations will happen beyond the intellect, for it is not an intellectual journey. Your intellect will grow to accommodate it. And you will learn over time to gain a greater perspective and greater wisdom about many things. But an intellectual journey it is not.</p>
<p>它的启示将发生在智力之外，因为它不是一段智力的旅程。你的智力将增长以适应它。随着时间的推移，你将学会对许多事情获得更大的视角和更大的智慧。但这不是一段智力的旅程。</p>
<p>For the intellect is a human invention. What created you and sent you into the world is not a human invention. What will reveal the greater life that you are destined to live and to fulfill is not a human invention. But it requires human participation, human wisdom, human ability, human trust and human discernment in order to manifest.</p>
<p>因为智力是人类的发明。创造你并让你来到这个世界的内识不是人类的发明。揭示你注定要过的生命以及要实现的更伟大生命的内识不是人类的发明。但它需要人类的参与、人类的智慧、人类的能力、人类的信任和人类的辨别力，才能显现出来。</p>
<p>Here you do not give all your power away to God, thinking that God is going to guide you in everything. That is ridiculous. Here you give yourself greater authority within yourself that is not of your own making. But this authority requires that you become responsible, that you become honest, that you become self-determined. It will require you to follow things that are mysterious, but most of the time you will have to be doing very practical things.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能把所有的力量都交给上帝，认为上帝会在所有事情上指导你。这是荒谬的。在这里，你在自己的内心深处赋予了自己更大的权威，而这种权威并不是你自己创造的。但这种权威要求你变得负责任，变得诚实，变得自决。它将要求你遵循那些神秘的事情，但大多数时间你必须要做非常实际的事情。</p>
<p>If you are in a relationship and you have children, do not make any sudden moves in your life. Build the strength first. Build the connection to Knowledge within yourself. Learn to listen. Take retreat. Follow your natural inclinations. Share only part of the mystery with your husband or wife, for they may not be able to understand. Ask that they give you this time and this confidence, for things are emerging within your heart.</p>
<p>如果你正处于一段关系中，并且有了孩子，不要在你的生命中做出任何突然的举动。先建立力量。在你的内心深处建立与内识的联接。学会倾听。采取隐退的方式。遵循你的自然倾向。只与你的丈夫或妻子分享部分神秘，因为他们可能无法理解。要求他们给你这个时间和这个信心，因为内识正在你的内心深处浮现。</p>
<p>Maintain your duties and responsibilities, but take time to be with the presence of Knowledge within yourself. Take time to take the Steps to Knowledge, to study the Steps to Knowledge and to place yourself in a position where they can reveal their greater truth to you.</p>
<p>保持你的职责和责任，但要花时间与你内心深处的内识同在。花时间开展内识的进阶，研究内识的进阶，并把自己放置在一个学生的位置上，使它们能够向你揭示更伟大的真理。</p>
<p>Tell your children that there is a greater power within them that will guide and protect them if they listen. Share with them your insights. But do not go too far in trying to share everything, for you are trying to build strength, and if you try to share everything, you are giving your strength away.</p>
<p>告诉你的孩子，如果他们倾听，他们内心深处有一种更伟大的力量，会引导和保护他们。与他们分享你的洞察力。但不要过分地试图分享一切，因为你正试图建立力量，如果你试图分享一切，你就会把你的力量给予出去。</p>
<p>Do not try to take care of other people beyond your children or an elderly parent here, for you are gaining strength within yourself. You are learning to conserve your energy. You are fasting now, holding yourself back from giving yourself away everywhere, holding yourself in reserve.</p>
<p>不要试图在这里照顾你的孩子或年迈的父母之外的其他人，因为你正在获得自己内心深处的力量。你正在学习保存你的能量。你现在正在禁食，阻止自己到处付出，把自己保留起来。</p>
<p>Do not make any sudden decisions about your primary relationships if you are married with children, for in most cases it will be premature. A marriage here will be greatly challenged. Whether it can proceed will be determined by many things, which you may not be able to ascertain in the moment.</p>
<p>如果你已经结婚有了孩子，不要对你的主要关系做出任何突然的决定，因为在大多数情况下，它将是不成熟的。这里的婚姻将受到极大的挑战。它是否能继续下去将由许多事情决定，你可能无法在当下确定这些事情。</p>
<p>Your task is to follow the emergence of Knowledge within yourself, to be true to that, to be the recipient, to pull yourself in, to take the time it takes for a great emergence to happen within you. And do not be impatient, for it will emerge in its own time. You do not yet realize the magnitude of what is happening or how great its possibilities for the future will be.</p>
<p>你的任务是追随自己内心深处内识的浮现，忠于它，成为接受者，把自己拉进去，花时间让一个伟大的浮现在你的内心深处发生。不要不耐烦，因为它将在它自己的时间里出现。你还没有意识到正在发生的事情的规模，或者它对未来的可能性有多大。</p>
<p>Limit the influences around you. Be silent with those who proclaim themselves, who have great judgments upon the world. Do not enter into debate at this point. Do not contend with others. Do not argue the issues. Do not assert your ideas. That is not important now and will be counterproductive for you.</p>
<p>限制你周围的影响。对那些宣称自己，对世界有重大判断的人要保持沉默。在这一点上不要进入辩论。不要与他人争论。不要争论这些问题。不要宣扬你的想法。现在这并不重要，对你来说会产生反作用。</p>
<p>The power and the presence of Knowledge is emerging within you. That is the most important thing. You are learning to become strong and inner directed within yourself. That is the most important thing. Maintain your duties. Provide for your children. But hold this as the most important thing. For ultimately your greatest relationship is with God. Your greatest responsibility is to the Knowledge that God has placed within you to respond to, to follow and to express. This is an unparalleled freedom, but it requires great inner strength and forbearance.</p>
<p>内识的力量和存在正在你内心深处浮现。这是最重要的事情。你正在学习如何在内心变得强大并自我引导。这是最重要的事情。保持你的职责。供养你的孩子。但要把这作为最重要的事情。因为最终你最大的关系是与上帝的关系。你最大的责任是对上帝放置在你内心深处的内识做出回应，遵循和表达。这是一种无与伦比的自由，但它需要伟大的内在力量和忍耐力。</p>
<p>These are guidelines for the beginning steps. Beyond this, you must learn to build the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. You must learn of the Greater Community. You must learn about the mental environment. You must learn about relationships and higher purpose. This is all awaiting you. But first you must build the foundation, for without this foundation, you will not be able to penetrate the greater meaning, importance and application of these revelations that are contained within the New Message from God.</p>
<p>这些是起始步骤的准则。除此之外，你必须学会建立你生命的四大支柱——关系支柱、工作支柱、健康支柱和精神发展支柱。你必须学习大社区。你必须学习心理环境。你必须学习关系和更高宗旨。这一切都在等待着你。但首先你必须打好基础，因为没有这个基础，你将无法渗透包含在上帝新讯息中的启示的更伟大意义、重要性和应用。</p>
<p>The foundation is so very important and requires great patience and forbearance. It is this patience and forbearance that will shift your allegiance away from your intellect and the admonitions of others to a greater power within you—the power of Knowledge, the power of God. You will never comprehend this power fully. You can never claim it for yourself. You will never be a master of it. You can never use it to try to be better than others. You cannot use it to get what you want. You cannot use it to gain wealth and power and pleasure. You can only learn to follow it and learn of the great journey up the mountain that was always prepared for you.</p>
<p>这个基础非常重要，需要极大的耐心和忍耐。正是这种耐心和忍耐将把你的效忠从你的智力和他人的告诫转移到你内心深处的更伟大力量——内识的力量，上帝的力量。你永远无法完全理解这种力量。你永远无法为自己要求它。你永远不会成为它的主人。你永远不能用它来试图比别人更好。你不能用它来获得你想要的东西。你不能用它来获得财富、权力和快乐。你只能学会跟随它，学习那条一直为你准备的伟大上山之旅。</p>
