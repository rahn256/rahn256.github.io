<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on January 26, 2008 in Estes Park, CO<br>2008年1月26日，在科罗拉多州埃斯蒂斯公园(Estes Park, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important in understanding the nature of the New Revelation that it was given to someone who was sent into the world for the purpose of receiving it. He is a man. He is not perfect. He is not magnificent according to people’s expectations, but he is the one destined to receive the New Message, and his life has been orchestrated to make this possible.</p>
<p>在理解新启示的性质时，很重要的一点是，启示被交给了信使，而信使就是为了接收启示而被派遣来到这个世界上的。他是一个人。他并不完美。他并没有按照人们的期望而变得华丽，但他是注定要接收新讯息的人，他的生命已经被精心安排，使这成为可能。</p>
<p>He has been guided to prepare for this for a very long time without really knowing what it was for. And he had to prove himself without realizing that he was proving himself for something very significant. He had to pass tests without knowing the nature of those tests or the meaning of success and failure.</p>
<p>指导他为此做了很长时间的准备，尽管他并不真正知道这是为了什么。他必须证明他自己，却没有意识到他是在为非常重要的事情证明他自己。他必须通过考验，却不知道这些考验的性质，也不知道成功和失败的意义。</p>
<p>Born into a conventional family, educated at the university, he showed few signs of the greatness of his future life. However, the restraint he felt from committing himself to any kind of specialized career, the restraint he had to exercise regarding his relationships with others and his commitment to things in the world was with him from the start.</p>
<p>他出生在一个传统的家庭，在大学里接受教育，几乎没有迹象表明他未来的生命会有多么伟大。然而，他从一开始就感受到一种克制，这种克制使他无法专注于任何特定的职业生涯，也使他在与他人的关系和对世间事务的承诺上始终保持克制。</p>
<p>His journey is inexplicable to anyone living in the world, for living in the world is only a partial experience of your complete reality. No matter how thorough your explanation or your theory might be, it will be by definition incomplete.</p>
<p>对于生活在这个世界上的任何人来说，他的旅程都是无法解释的，因为生活在这个世界上只是你对完整现实的部分体验。无论你的解释或你的理论多么透彻，根据定义，它都是不完整的。</p>
<p>Marshall was given certain tasks to cultivate: inner listening, discernment of others, an understanding of human nature, human relationships, and a direct experience of the natural world. He was allowed to make mistakes and to experiment as a young man. He was able to experience the condition of humanity and taste the pleasures and sorrows of a more affluent life.</p>
<p>马歇尔被赋予了一些需要培养的任务：内心的倾听、对他人的辨别、对人性的理解、人际关系以及对自然世界的直接体验。作为一个年轻人，他被允许犯错误和进行试验。他能够体验人类的状况，品尝到更富裕的生命的快乐和悲伤。</p>
<p>His relationships helped him to learn how to be with other people effectively, to partner with other people, to live with other people. But he was kept from becoming a completely worldly person—a person whose whole focus and emphasis is on achievement within the world. For this, he experienced restraint—[was] offered opportunities which he had to decline, given encouragement which he could not accept, experiencing inducements that he had to deny.</p>
<p>他的关系帮助他学习如何有效地与他人相处，与他人合作，与他人生活。但他被阻止成为一个完全世俗的人——一个把全部精力和重点都放在世俗成就上的人。为此，他经历了种种限制——接受了他必须拒绝的机会，得到了他不能接受的鼓励，经历了他必须否认的诱惑。</p>
<p>He made mistakes, oh, yes, but none that would cost him his preparation for his future life. His imperfections are acknowledged. He recognizes them. His role does not require him to meet the expectations of others who think that if there was a New Message from God, it would be delivered by some kind of super person, a super man or a super woman—someone who is without flaw, someone who is magnificent and can perform miracles. These kinds of expectations are inherent in human perception, for people do not understand the nature and Purpose and Plan of God. Even the scriptures themselves cannot reveal this fully.</p>
<p>他犯过错误，哦，是的，但没有一个错误会让他失去对未来生命的准备。他承认并认识到自己的不完美。他的角色并不要求他满足其他人的期望，这些人认为如果有来自上帝的新讯息，它将是某种超凡的人，一位超人或一位女超人来传递——一个没有缺陷的人，一个宏伟的人，可以创造奇迹。这类期望是人类认知中固有的，因为人们不理解上帝的自然、目的和计划。甚至连经文本身也无法完全揭示这一点。</p>
<p>So Marshall had to travel as a young man, living without definition in the context of society. He had to maintain a focus on developing certain kinds of qualities: the quality of observation, the quality of evaluation and compassion for others, even concerning very grievous situations.</p>
<p>因此，马歇尔在年轻时必须旅行，生活在社会背景下没有明确定位的状态中。他必须保持专注，发展某些品质：观察的品质、评估的品质以及对他人的同情心，即使是在面对非常严重或痛苦的情况时。</p>
<p>But at the same time, he was kept out of war and conflict. He was kept out of marriage and parenthood. He was kept out of career, his goals always being moderated by the presence of Knowledge, the deeper intelligence within him. Patience, perseverance, self-confidence, humility, compassion, friendliness, but reserved—these are the qualities that he had to cultivate way before he could have any sense of his greater purpose and calling in the world.</p>
<p>但与此同时，他被排除在战争和冲突之外。他被挡在了婚姻和亲子关系之外。他被挡在事业之外，他的目标总是被内识的存在所制约，即他内心深处的更深层次的智能。耐心、毅力、自信、谦逊、富有同情心、友善但不失稳重——这些都是他必须培养的品质，在他能够对他在这个世界上的更伟大目的和召唤有任何感觉之前。</p>
<p>It is true that the Message must be given to one person to maintain its purity, and this person must be the right person, the one chosen. This person must have assistance and companionship. For this, Marshall was sent a woman of great strength and integrity to be his wife and companion. And he was given a son who would help him fulfill his great mission in the world. And others were sent to assist him, some staying with him only for a while and others continuing with him even to this day. For the Messenger cannot travel alone. The Messenger must have assistance in receiving and bringing such a great Teaching into the world. And his companions must be strong and courageous, flexible and unassuming. Their connection with Marshall must be deep, profound and pre-established, you see.</p>
<p>诚然，讯息必须交给一个人，以保持其纯洁性，而这个人必须是正确的人，是被选中的人。这个人必须有援助和陪伴。为此，为马歇尔派来一位具有伟大力量和完整性的女性，作为他的妻子和伴侣。他还得到了一个儿子，他将帮助他完成他在这个世界上的伟大使命。其他人也被派来协助他，有些人只和他呆了一段时间，有些人甚至一直和他在一起，直到今天。因为信使不能独自旅行。信使必须得到他人的协助，才能接收并将如此伟大的教导带到这个世界上。而他的同伴必须是强大而勇敢的，灵活而不张扬的。你看，他们与马歇尔的联接必须是深厚的、深刻的和预先建立的。</p>
<p>For he will not win people over with charm and charisma or intellectual brilliance. He will not captivate people by fulfilling their expectations of grandeur or power or strength. His power is in the New Message and in his capacity to receive and to carry the New Message and to be its first student and its primary representative.</p>
<p>因为他不会用魅力和人格魅力或智慧的光辉来赢得人们。他不会通过满足人们对宏伟、权力或力量的期望来吸引他们。他的力量在于新讯息，在于他有能力接收和传递新讯息，成为新讯息的第一位学生和主要代表。</p>
<p>People’s notions of power are so distorted, are so incorrect, that people look for the wrong things here. Grace and humility, perseverance, trustworthiness, patience, silence—these are the qualities of a powerful individual. Yet this is not what your cultures and your nations celebrate as demonstrating a real power or efficacy. Only the willful are so recognized, only the adventurous, only the ambitious, only those who use force to gain what they claim for themselves. But that is not the power of Grace. That is not the power that God emphasizes within the individual. And that is not the power of the Messenger.</p>
<p>人们对力量的概念是如此扭曲、如此不正确，以至于人们在这里寻求错误的力量。恩典与谦逊、毅力、值得信赖、耐心、沉默——这些才是一个有力量的个体所具备的品质。然而，这并不是你们的文化和国家所推崇的真正的力量或功效。只有意志坚强的人才能得到认可，只有勇于冒险的人才能得到认可，只有野心勃勃的人才能得到认可，只有那些用武力为他们自己争取利益的人才能得到认可。但这不是恩典的力量。这不是上帝在个人内心强调的力量。这也不是信使的力量。</p>
<p>It would be a long time, even with his companions, before the reality of his great endeavor would be revealed to him. This was done to prevent any error on his part or the risk of denial and avoidance. For if the timing is not correct here, a person can feel overwhelmed and withdraw—even according to something they are destined to do, that is meant for them to do, that they have come into the world to do.</p>
<p>即使有同伴在身边，这个过程依然漫长，直到他伟大事业的现实被揭示给他。这样做是为了防止他的任何错误或否认和回避的风险。因为如果这里的时机不对，一个人也可能会感到不堪重负而选择退缩——即使这件事是他们注定要做的，是他们来到这个世界要完成的使命。</p>
<p>Those who create their roles, those who advertise themselves in their self-created roles do not have this quality, you see? And they do not possess the gifts of the Messenger.</p>
<p>你看，那些创造他们角色的人，那些在他们自己创造的角色中宣传他们的人不具备这种品质？他们也不具备信使的礼物。</p>
<p>The Revelation of the New Message will be astonishing to the Messenger. He will hardly be able to believe it, given his human perspective, given his long acclimation to the world. He has developed a personal identity, a set of habits and self-orientations, so the Revelation was striking, and he did not welcome it. He did not want it.</p>
<p>新讯息的启示将使信使感到惊讶。鉴于他的人类视角，鉴于他对世界的长期适应，他将很难相信它。他已经形成了一种个人身份，一套习惯和自我定位，因此，启示是惊人的，他并不欢迎它。他也不想要它。</p>
<p>All the great Messengers that have been sent into the world have experienced the very same thing, and once the truth of their mission was revealed to them, they were very reluctant. It looked impossible. It looked improbable. It looked overwhelming. It looked dangerous. It looked beyond their abilities. It was inconsistent with how they viewed themselves. It spoke of a strength they barely knew they had. And it denied all other claims that that individual might have for themselves as to who they were and what they must have and do and so forth.</p>
<p>所有被派往世界的伟大信使都经历过同样的事情，一旦他们的使命的真理被揭示出来，他们都感到非常不情愿。它看起来是不可能的。它看起来是难以实现的。它看起来是压倒性的。它看起来是危险的。它看起来超出了他们的能力。它与他们看待他们自己的方式不一致。它谈及了一种他们几乎不知道他们拥有的力量。而且它否定了那个人可能对他们自己的所有其他要求，即他们是谁，他们必须拥有什么，必须做什么，等等的所有其他主张。</p>
<p>So it was not until late in receiving the New Message that Marshall was told what it really was. All those years of receiving the Revelation had to be conducted without the certainty of what it meant, what it was for, what it was to serve and to do and how it could be expressed and explained. He had to undertake this without knowing really what it was for and what it really was, you see. He had to take this journey, and others had to take it with him, only knowing that the journey they were on was vital and important and essential, but beyond that, it remained mysterious and confounding.</p>
<p>因此，直到接收新讯息的后期，马歇尔才被告知它真正的角色。在接收启示的这些年里，他必须在不确定其意义、目的、服务对象和表达方式的情况下进行所有的接收工作。你看，他必须在不知道启示的真正目的和真正意义的情况下开展这项工作。他必须踏上这段旅程，而其他人也必须和他一起踏上这段旅程，他们只知道他们所踏上的旅程是至关重要的、意义深远的、必不可少的，但除此之外，它仍然是神秘的、令人困惑的。</p>
<p>Once the Revelation was given as to the real nature of what he had been receiving and learning and attempting to communicate, that began a whole other stage in his preparation. Now he had to transcend his former idea of himself to meet the requirements that his mission placed upon him.</p>
<p>一旦启示揭示了他所接收到、学习并试图传达的真正性质，这就开始了他准备工作的另一个阶段。现在，他必须超越他先前对他自己的想法，以满足使命对他所提出的要求。</p>
<p>Now instead of being just a person who was given something important to do, he had to become a vessel for the greater gift that he was bound and destined to receive and to give. And he had to overcome his self-doubt and his reluctance, all the while knowing that what he was doing was beyond his comprehension and likely beyond even his capacity to understand.</p>
<p>现在，他不再只是一个被赋予重要任务的人，而是必须成为一个容器，来承载他注定要接收和给予的更伟大礼物。他必须克服他的自我怀疑和不情愿，同时知道他正在做的事情超出了他的理解范围，甚至可能超出了他的理解能力。</p>
<p>Throughout history, the great Messengers that have come into the world have not been understood, and their Messages were often misinterpreted and misapplied. Such is the difficulty of bringing something pure into a world and to a humanity that are impure, that are full of grievance and conflict, ambition and degeneration.</p>
<p>纵观历史，来到世界上的伟大信使都没有被理解，他们的讯息往往被曲解（错误的解释）和误用。要把纯洁的启示带到一个不纯洁的世界，带给充满怨恨和冲突、野心和堕落的人类，难度可想而知。</p>
<p>People do not understand the nature of the mission, nor the great burden that the Messenger would have to assume. Instead, stories were invented to capture the public imagination, to sell the Teaching, to amplify its significance to the unknowing, to give it a power that people wanted it to have instead of the power that it really possessed. In many cases, the Message was never written down correctly. It was contained within the Messenger, demonstrated by the Messenger.</p>
<p>人们不理解这个使命的性质，也不理解信使必须承担的重任。相反，人们编造了一些故事来捕捉公众的想象力，推销教导，向不知情的人放大它的意义，赋予它一种人们希望它拥有的力量，而不是它真正拥有的力量。在许多情况下，讯息从未被正确写下。它被包含在信使中，由信使进行展示。</p>
<p>But in this situation, it was necessary that the Message be rendered, recorded, transcribed and published so people would have access to the pure Message and the pure Teaching. Should anything happen to the Messenger, the real Message would not be lost. Also, [this was done] to preserve the Message in its pure form so it does not undergo radical alterations or adaptations in the future, so it is not allied with other things for the convenience of people’s understanding or for the advantage of governments or the state.</p>
<p>但在这种情况下，有必要对讯息进行渲染、记录、转录和出版，以便人们能够获得纯净的讯息和纯粹的教导。如果信使发生意外，真正的讯息也不会被丢失。此外，这样做也是为了保留讯息的纯正形式，以便它在未来不会发生根本性的改变或调整，因此，它不会为了人们理解的便利或政府或国家的利益而与其他事物相结合。</p>
<p>Therefore, Marshall had to receive the Message before he could communicate the Message. He had to put it into a permanent form, sometimes having to alter the words to make them more comprehensible, but delivering [the Message] in as pure a form as possible with the assistance of those who were sent to help him.</p>
<p>因此，马歇尔在传播讯息之前，必须先收到讯息。他必须把讯息转化为一种永久的形式，有时不得不改变词语，使其更加易于理解，但在那些被派来帮助他的人协助下，他尽可能以最纯粹的形式传递这个讯息。</p>
<p>In this way, should anything happen to the Messenger, the Message is here. People will have to deal with the Message itself instead of just repudiating the Messenger. They will have to struggle with the Message itself and all that it challenges in people and all that it acknowledges that is true.</p>
<p>这样一来，如果信使发生任何意外，讯息就在这里。人们将不得不处理讯息本身，而不仅仅是否定信使。他们将不得不与讯息本身作斗争，以及讯息对人们的所有挑战和它承认的所有真实。</p>
<p>You are seeing for the first time here the real nature of Revelation, the real nature and purpose of a true Messenger in the world. You are seeing here for the first time how God gives great Messages into the world to serve the world at that time and for the times to come, and how the successive Messages given over a long period of time have built upon each other and met new and changing conditions. You are seeing for the first time here how God works in the world beyond the stories from the past, beyond the proclamations and the traditions, whether they be true or false. You are seeing the nature of Revelation.</p>
<p>你在这里第一次看到了启示的真正性质，一位真实的信使在这个世界上的真正性质和目的。你在这里第一次看到上帝是如何将伟大的讯息赐予世界的，服务于当时以及未来的时代，以及在很长一段时间内所给予的连续讯息是如何建立在彼此之上并满足新的和不断变化的环境。你在这里第一次看到上帝是如何在这个世界上工作的，超越了过去的故事，超越了宣言和传统，无论它们是真还是假。你正在看到启示的本质。</p>
<p>This is important to see because if the process of Revelation is not understood, the Revelation itself will not be understood. If the burden of the Messenger is not recognized, then the Messenger will not be recognized.</p>
<p>看到这一点很重要，因为如果不理解启示的过程，启示本身就不会被理解。如果不承认信使的负担，那信使也不会被认出。</p>
<p>Should you not recognize the Messenger, it will be to your great disadvantage, for he brings with him an awareness and a preparation for great dangers facing humanity and great opportunities for human unity and cooperation. He brings with him the blessings of purpose and integrity in one’s individual life and the meaning of relationships at a higher, more complete level. He brings with him a promise of humanity’s future within a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe and what humanity will have to do to face a world of declining resources and growing human conflict.</p>
<p>如果你认不出信使，这将对你非常不利，因为他带来了对人类正面临的巨大危险的觉知和准备，以及人类团结与合作的伟大机会。他带来了对一个人生命的目的和完整性的祝福，以及在一种更高、更完整层面上的关系的意义。他带来了人类在宇宙智能生命大社区中的未来的承诺，以及人类面对资源日益减少、人类冲突日益加剧的世界所必须采取的行动。</p>
<p>The Messenger has brought the Message. It is in a form that people can read. It is not some later interpretation. It is not something that has been kept secret by hidden parties or inner circles alone. It has been given to the people during the process of Revelation itself. This has never been done before. Now living in a world where things can be published and writings can be transcribed and translated into other languages and presented electronically, that gives the opportunity for the written word to be given everywhere. Phenomenal it is, so important now, for you do not have much time.</p>
<p>信使已经带来了讯息。它是以人们可以阅读的形式呈现的。它不是后来的解释。它不是由隐秘的党派或内部圈子单独保密的信息。它是在启示的过程中传递给人们的。这在以前是从来没有过的。现在生活在一个讯息可以被出版，著作可以被转录和翻译成其他语言并以电子方式呈现的世界之中，提供了将书面文字传遍各地的机会。它是惊人的，现在如此重要，因为你们没有多少时间了。</p>
<p>The world is changing too fast, and the dangers are coming—the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world. You do not have decades and centuries to try to figure out what this is or try to translate or have it pass just from person to person in some kind of oral tradition. There is no time for that now, you see, and that is why the Revelation has been given in this way.</p>
<p>世界变化得太快，危险即将来临——变革的巨浪即将席卷世界。你们没有数十年、数百年的时间来试图弄清楚启示是什么，也没有时间去翻译，更没有时间让它以某种口耳相传的方式从一个人传到另一个人。你看，现在已经没有时间了，这就是为什么启示是以这种方式给出的。</p>
<p>Marshall’s progress and preparation has been delayed by the failures of certain people to come and assist him. He has been held back by circumstances. Certain others were called but did not respond, and some who responded could not fulfill their destiny here—all this holding back the Revelation of the New Message at a time when it was needed, slowing the whole process down. This then is the hazard of bringing a Revelation from God into the world. There is so much that can hold it back, that can thwart it, that can even prevent it from being received and communicated.</p>
<p>马歇尔的进展和准备工作由于某些人未能前来协助他而被推迟。他一直受到环境的制约。还有一些人被召唤，但没有回应，而一些回应的人却不能在这里完成他们的使命——所有这些都在需要新讯息的时候阻碍了新信息的启示，使整个过程缓慢下来。这就是把上帝的启示带到世界上的危险。有太多的事情可以阻碍它，可以阻挠它，甚至可以阻止它被接收和传达。</p>
<p>This New Message is not just for one nation, for one group, for one religion. It is for the whole people of the world. It is a Revelation for the world. It is not meant to replace the world’s religions, but to call for their unity and their strength, to emphasize their common truth, to end the ceaseless conflict between them and to unite them so they may serve humanity in its time of great need.</p>
<p>这个新讯息不仅仅是为一个国家、一个群体、一种宗教而设。它是为整个世界的人民而设的。它是对世界的一种启示。它不是要取代世界上的各种宗教，而是要呼唤它们的团结和力量，强调它们的共同真理，结束它们之间无休止的冲突，并将它们联合起来，以便在人类最需要的时候为其服务。</p>
<p>It will be very challenging for people to receive the Message and the Messenger. He will point to the New Message, for you must deal with the New Message first. But his presence and the meaning and the great substance of his Divine communication is something that will be very challenging to face and to take on. It will take much time to learn and to comprehend.</p>
<p>对人们来说，接纳讯息和信使将是非常具有挑战性的。他将指向新讯息，因为你必须首先处理新讯息。但是，他的存在、他的神圣沟通的意义和伟大的实质，都将是非常具有挑战性的事情。它将需要很多时间来学习和理解。</p>
<p>People will think they understand it, but they will not understand it. People will claim that it is easy to comprehend, but they have not comprehended it. People will associate it with other things, things they are familiar with, other things that have been learned and taught in the world, but there has been nothing like this ever brought into the world: Knowledge and Wisdom from the Greater Community. Teaching about spirituality at the level of Knowledge has only been known to very few people in the history of the world and never presented as a Message for humanity itself.</p>
<p>人们会认为他们理解它，但他们不会理解它。人们会声称它很容易理解，但他们并没有理解它。人们会把它与其他事物联系在一起，与他们所熟悉的事物联系在一起，与世界上所学和所教的其他事物联系在一起，但从来没有像这样的讯息被带到这个世界上。来自大社区的内识和智慧。在世界历史上，只有极少数人知道关于内识层面的精神性教学，而且从未作为人类本身的讯息被呈现。</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge will be for the recipient—for you and for all those who are so fortunate to receive the New Message at the earliest time possible. For it will bring clarity and purpose and power to your life, and you need that right now. But its gift to the world is even greater than what it will do for your life.</p>
<p>因此，挑战将在于接收者——你和所有有幸尽早收到新讯息的人。因为它将给你的生命带来清晰、目的和力量，而你现在就需要这些。但是，它带给世界的礼物甚至比它对你的生命的影响更大。</p>
<p>To know this you must have a relationship with the New Message. You cannot stand apart from it and judge it and criticize it and evaluate it. That is hopeless. It is foolish. What you will encounter are your own prejudices, your own limitations, your own assumptions and preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>要知道这一点，你必须与新讯息建立起关系。你不能站在它之外，评判它，批评它，评估它。那是没有希望的。它是愚蠢的。你将遇到的是你自己的偏见、你自己的局限、你自己的假设和先入为主的想法。</p>
<p>You have to come to this with an open mind to see what the New Message can reveal to you. If you come fearfully or thinking it will upset your beliefs or invalidate your traditions, then you will not be able to penetrate it. You will just judge it blindly. You will not be able to receive its grace, its power and its vision of the future.</p>
<p>你必须以开放的心灵来接触这个新的讯息，看看新讯息能向你揭示的启示。如果你带着恐惧来，或者认为它会颠覆你的信仰或使你的传统失效，那你就无法穿透它。你将只是盲目地判断它。你将无法接收到它的恩典、力量和它对未来的展望。</p>
<p>The Messenger now will need great assistance from others to bring this New Message into the world. It is not something one person can do. It is not something a small group of individuals—committed as they are, devoted as they are—can really do. It is going to take the assistance of others. It is going to take people learning The Way of Knowledge, learning the New Message, living the New Message and seeing its complete relevance to the world that you see and its complete relevance to the world you have not yet seen.</p>
<p>信使现在需要其他人的大力协助，把这个新讯息带入世界。它不是一个人可以做到的事。它也不是一小群个人——尽管他们坚定不移，尽管他们有奉献——能够真正做到的。它将需要其他人的帮助。它将需要人们学习内识之路，学习新讯息，生活在新讯息之中，看到它与你所看到的世界的完全相关性，以及它与你尚未看到的世界的完全相关性。</p>
<p>The Messenger will need protection. He will need true students. He will need supporters. And he will need others to simply bear witness to this great event in human history.</p>
<p>信使将需要保护。他将需要真实的学生。他将需要支持者。他还需要其他人来见证人类历史上的这个伟大的事件。</p>
<p>It will seem incredible, incomprehensible. People will not believe it. They will think it is impossible: “God gave all God’s Revelations so long ago. It is in the sacred texts.” Many people will not be able to accept that God has spoken again, that there is a New Revelation in the world—as if they could assume to know the Mind and Will of God, as if they could insist that they knew God’s Plan and God’s Truth for themselves. This is foolish and arrogant, of course, but many people take this position without question.</p>
<p>它将显得不可思议，无法理解。人们将不相信它。他们会认为这是不可能的：“上帝早已将所有的启示赐予世人。它就在神圣的文本中。”许多人将无法接受上帝再次讲话，无法接受世界上有一个新的启示——就好像他们可以假定他们知道上帝的心灵和意志，仿佛他们可以坚持认为他们自己知道上帝的计划和上帝的真理。这当然是愚蠢和傲慢的，但许多人却毫不怀疑地采取了这种立场。</p>
<p>To know the New Message, you must witness it. You must learn of it. You must let it provide clarity and meaning for your life. That is the only way you will know its Source, its truth and its relevance to the world and to your life.</p>
<p>要知道新讯息，你必须见证它。你必须学习它。你必须让它为你的生命提供清晰度和意义。只有这样，你才能知道它的来源、它的真理以及它对世界和你的生命的意义。</p>
<p>It represents a Divine relationship, and it is a relationship you can bring into your spiritual and religious tradition—allowing the New Message to add another dimension to your religious practice and study, letting it fulfill what was preserved and presented before.</p>
<p>它代表着一种神圣的关系，你可以将这种关系带入你的精神和宗教传统——允许新讯息为你的宗教实践和研究增加另一个维度，让它实现之前所保留和呈现的内识。</p>
<p>For humanity is facing a new set of circumstances that it has never faced before. And a New Revelation has been given to prepare humanity, to warn humanity and to strengthen humanity so that it may unite in the face of these Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>因为人类正面临着一系列新的环境，这是它以前从未面对过的环境。而新的启示已经被给予，以便为人类做准备，警告人类，并加强人类，使其能够在面对这些变革的巨浪时可以团结起来。</p>
<p>God knows what humanity needs even though humanity remains confused. God knows what is coming for the human family even though the human family is obsessed with its past. God knows that humanity must unite in the face of great danger even though people continue their conflicts and continue their admonitions against one another. What God knows and what people believe are not the same.</p>
<p>上帝知道人类需要内识，尽管人类仍然困惑。上帝知道人类大家庭将面临的事情，尽管人类大家庭还沉迷于它的过去。上帝知道，面对巨大的危险，人类必须团结起来，尽管人们继续他们的冲突，继续他们的相互告诫。上帝所知道的和人们所相信的并不一样。</p>
<p>This makes the translation and the presentation of the New Message difficult, but such a Message must be given. It must reach those who can hear, who can see, who can know, whose approach is pure, who do not come here with condemnation, who come here to receive clarity and power and purpose and the meaning of relationship. They come to be blessed by the New Message and empowered by it and confronted by it.</p>
<p>这使得新讯息的翻译和介绍变得困难重重，但这样的讯息也必须被给予。它必须传达到那些能够听见、能够看见、能够知道的人，那些心态纯净的人，那些不是带着指责而来的人，而是来寻求清晰、力量、目的和关系意义的人。他们来是为了被新讯息所祝福，被它赋予力量，并面对它的挑战。</p>
<p>What humanity does with this New Message will be up to humanity. God cannot control humanity’s response. God cannot control the outcome of humanity’s response. If you understood the nature of God’s relationship with the world and with humanity, this would be very clear to you. But if you do not understand, it will seem confusing and confounding and upsetting perhaps.</p>
<p>人类如何对待这个新讯息将取决于人类自己。上帝无法控制人类的反应。上帝无法控制人类反应的结果。如果你理解上帝与世界和人类的关系的自然，这对你来说将是非常清晰的。但如果你不理解，它就会显得混乱，令人困惑，甚至令人不安。</p>
<p>But God has placed within each person the power of Knowledge: the ability to see and know the truth beyond deception, beyond personal preference. This Knowledge must come to the fore for many people now, for the world to have a future, for humanity to be able to continue and to set a new course.</p>
<p>但是，上帝在每个人的内心深处都放置了内识的力量：超越欺骗、超越个人喜好，看见并知道真理的能力。现在，为了世界的未来，为了人类能够继续前进并设定新的航向，这种内识现在必须出现在许多人的面前。</p>
<p>The New Message does not have a political agenda. It is here to inspire right action and the recognition and the necessity of cooperation in the face of real change and events in the world.</p>
<p>新讯息没有政治议程。它在这里是为了激励正确的行动，促使人们认识到在面对世界上真正的变化和事件时，合作的必要性。</p>
<p>It will teach you how to listen, and to learn what God wants you to do in your life, and what is meant for you, and where your true strengths and success lie, beyond all of the persuasions and deceptions of the world.</p>
<p>它将教你如何倾听，学习上帝希望你在生命中做的事情，什么是为你而设的，在哪里你能找到真实的力量和成功，超越这个世界的所有诱惑和欺骗。</p>
<p>The Messenger now is in the world. He is even now continuing to bring the New Message into the world. He has done his great task of receiving the majority of the New Message. It will be complete. He is not here to proclaim himself as a ruler or a leader or a great power. He is here simply to bear witness to the New Message and to be its primary advocate. He is not here to claim political power or economic power, or to displace other people, or to overthrow anyone. His presence here is to serve as a demonstration and as a presentation of the Wisdom and the Love of God and the great challenges now facing the human family, for which humanity is not prepared.</p>
<p>信使现在就在这个世界上。他现在甚至还在继续将新讯息带入世界。他已经完成了接收大部分新讯息的伟大任务。它将是完整的。他在这里不是为了宣称他自己是一位统治者或领导者或一种伟大的力量。他在这里只是为新讯息做见证，并成为其主要倡导者。他在这里不是为了索取政治权力或经济权力，也不是为了取代其他人，或推翻任何人。他在这里是为了展示和呈现上帝的智慧和上帝之爱，以及人类大家庭现在面临的巨大挑战，人类还没有准备好应对这些挑战。</p>
<p>Therefore, receive the Messenger and support him in whatever way you can. Allow your heart to tell you what must be done. Recognize and receive the blessings of the New Message, which is now becoming available to the world for the very first time.</p>
<p>因此，请接纳信使，并尽你所能支持他。让你的心告诉你必须做什么。认识并接收新讯息的祝福，它现在是第一次向世界提供。</p>
<p>Take time to consider it. Take time to be with it. Take time to struggle with it. Take time to allow it to reveal things to you that have never been shown to you before. Allow it to confirm what you have always known to be true and to reveal the thread of truth that has been in your life all along. Allow it to illuminate your religious traditions—to reveal their purity, to reveal their core truth, to reveal that they have all come from God, to reveal the One Spirituality of humanity, and to reveal humanity’s great threshold of facing a universe full of intelligent life and learning to reverse the great decline that is taking place in the world today.</p>
<p>花时间去思考它。花时间与它相处。花时间去与它挣扎。花时间让它向你揭示以前从未向你展示过的内识。允许它证实你一直知道的真实，并揭示一直存在于你生命中的真理之线。让它照亮你的宗教传统——揭示它们的纯洁性，揭示它们的核心真理，揭示它们都来自上帝，揭示人类的唯一精神性，以及揭示人类正面临充满智能生命的宇宙的伟大门槛，并学习如何扭转当今世界正在发生的巨大衰退。</p>
<p>The burden is on the recipient. The Messenger has taken a long and difficult journey, even to this point. The burden is on the recipient now. It is the integrity and the honesty and the desire of the heart that will count and enable you to receive the New Message for yourself and to understand its importance for the world.</p>
<p>负担在接收者身上。信使已经走过了漫长而艰难的旅程，甚至走到了这一步。现在，负担落在了接收者身上。完整性、诚实和内心的渴望才是最重要的，才能让你自己接收到新讯息，并理解它对世界的重要性。</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>
<p>让这成为你的理解。</p>
