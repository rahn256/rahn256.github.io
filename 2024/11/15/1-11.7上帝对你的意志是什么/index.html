<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 21, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年10月21日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have come into the world for a greater purpose, a greater purpose that was given you before you came here. This greater purpose is held sacred within the deeper Intelligence within you, the deeper Intelligence that God has given you called Knowledge.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的，一个在你来这里之前就被赋予的更伟大的目的。这个更伟大的目的是由你内心深处的更深层次的智能所神圣守护的，上帝赋予你的更深层次的智能被称为内识。</p>
<p>You were sent into the world first to learn how to live in the world, to learn how to communicate and associate successfully with other people and to adapt to living in a state of Separation—a state where you had a separate reality and identity that were distinct from others, a reality where you were unknown and unrecognized, except perhaps by a very few people.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界，首先是为了学习如何生活，学习如何与他人成功沟通和交往，并适应生活在一种分离的状态中——在这种状态中，你拥有一种不同于他人的分离现实和身份，在这种现实中，除了极少数人，你是不为人知、不被认可的。</p>
<p>This reality in the world is so very different from where you have come from, and it takes a long time to develop here. It takes a long time to learn how to be in the world with even a basic set of skills.</p>
<p>这个世界的现实与你来自的地方是如此的不同，需要很长时间才能在这里发展。学习如何在这个世界上生存，哪怕是掌握一套基本的技能，也需要很长的时间。</p>
<p>Your greater purpose is kept sacred within you beyond the reach of your intellect, held sacred there until you could reach a point in your life where you would feel a deeper stirring within you, a deeper need emerging within you—the deeper need to know who you are and why you are here and what you must accomplish.</p>
<p>你的更伟大目的在你的内在被神圣地保留着，超越你的智力所能触及的范围，神圣地保存在你的内心深处，直到你的生命达到一个阶段，你会感受到内心深处更强烈的悸动，更深层次的需求在你的内心深处涌现——更深层次的需求就是要知道你是谁，你为什么在这里，你必须完成什么。</p>
<p>This greater purpose is not what you think, and rarely will it ever reflect your personal goals or aspirations. But the fact that you are seeking for it is real and consistent, and that you are searching for those individuals who will enable you to discover this purpose and to help you fulfill it and express it.</p>
<p>这个更伟大目的并非你所想的那样，它很少会反映你的个人目标或抱负。但事实上你在寻求它，这是真实而始终如一的，你在寻找那些能让你发现这个目的并帮助你实现和表达这个目的的个人。</p>
<p>You have come here for a greater purpose, but it is being carried like a secret cargo within you, a secret cargo that you have yet to discover. But you have signs and clues. Your mind is oriented and designed in a unique way for this purpose, and you have experienced deeper inclinations at various points in your life.</p>
<p>你来到这里是为了一个更伟大的目的，但它就像你内心的一种秘密货物，一种你尚未发现的秘密货物。但你有迹象和线索。你的心灵以一种独特的方式被引导和设计来达到这个目的，你在生命中的各个阶段经历了更深层次的倾向。</p>
<p>When you reach a state of greater maturity, you will feel a deeper stirring within yourself. You will begin to have a deeper kind of experience—an experience that will alter very slightly, but profoundly, your view of yourself, your view of the world, your values, your interests and so forth—as if you have reached a kind of threshold beyond which you undergo a kind of inner change.</p>
<p>当你达到更成熟的状态时，你会感觉到你自己内心深处的一种更深层次的激荡。你将开始拥有一种更深层次的体验——这种体验会非常细微但深刻地改变你对你自己的看法、你对世界的看法、你的价值观、你的兴趣等等——仿佛你已经到达了一种门槛，越过这个门槛，你就会经历一种内在的改变。</p>
<p>No longer satisfied with the seeming pleasures and distractions of the world, you look for something deeper. You look for something that reflects your deeper nature and the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>你不再满足于世间表面的快乐和纷扰，而是寻找更深层次的内识。你寻求一种能够反映你更深层次的自然以及将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的的内识。</p>
<p>Before, while you were highly critical of the world around you and highly critical of other people and perhaps yourself, now you begin to see a connection between the state of the world, the state of people, your own state and the purpose and meaning of your greater contribution to others. This connection can seem very faint at the outset, very partial, but eventually you will come to find that you were sent to serve the very world that you see around you, but only a unique aspect of it, or a certain problem, or a certain need.</p>
<p>以前，你对周围的世界、对其他人，甚至对你自己都持高度批评态度，但现在你开始看到世界的状况、人们的状况、你自己的状况与你为他人做出更伟大贡献的目的和意义之间存在着联接。这种联接一开始可能看起来很微弱，很片面，但最终你会发现，你被派来服务你周围的世界，但只是服务于这个世界的一个独特方面，或特定的问题，或特定的需求。</p>
<p>There is a problem in the world that has your name on it, a need in the world that calls to you beyond all other things. You have clues already because there are certain things that you encounter that excite intense reaction within you. Perhaps it is a critical reaction, but it seems to stand out far and beyond other things that might irritate you or excite you.</p>
<p>世界上有一个问题与你有关，世界上有一种需求比所有其他事物都更能吸引你。你已经有了线索，因为你遇到的特定事情会激起你内心的强烈反应。也许这是一种批判性的反应，但它似乎比其他可能让你恼火或兴奋的事情更突出。</p>
<p>It is a clue. It is not an answer yet, but it is a clue. And that you are oriented in a certain way and have certain skills or inherent strengths—these are clues as well.</p>
<p>这是一条线索。虽然还不是答案，但这是一条线索。而且你有特定的倾向，有特定的技能或固有的优势——这些也是线索。</p>
<p>Here instead of looking at what you want, you look at your natural orientation. And part of the discovery of this purpose is a process of elimination of other things. You come to terms with things that you should not do, could not do, and this begins to narrow your range of choice.</p>
<p>在这里，你不是看你想要什么，而是看你的自然取向。而发现这个目的的一部分就是排除其他事物的过程。你开始接受你不应该做、不能做的事情，这开始缩小你的选择范围。</p>
<p>It is like a process of elimination where you come to accept your limitations; you come to accept that there are certain things you cannot do, ways of living that would not work for you, relationships that would be inappropriate for you, and you begin to limit your choices. Here the discovery of your greater purpose is the result of a process of elimination more than it is having endless choices to do whatever you think you might want to do.</p>
<p>它就像一个排除法，你会接受你的局限性；你会接受有些事情你不能做，有些生活方式不适合你，有些关系不适合你，然后你开始限制你的选择。在这里，你会发现更伟大的目的更多的是排除法的结果，而不是拥有无限的选择去做任何你想做的事情。</p>
<p>Life, through the experience of disappointment and sometimes shocking disillusionment, will help you in this regard. For you cannot be whatever you want to be, do whatever you want to do, adapt yourself to any set of circumstances or to any relationship that might be attractive. If you are being really honest with yourself, you see that so many of these options and choices would be completely wrong for you. This is an important step in your self-awareness and in building wisdom in the world.</p>
<p>生命会通过失望和有时令人震惊的幻灭来帮助你。因为你不可能成为你想成为的人，做你想做的事，适应任何可能有吸引力的环境或关系。如果你对你自己非常诚实，你会发现很多这些选择对你来说都是完全错误的。这是你自我觉知和建立世界智慧的重要一步。</p>
<p>People spend their entire lives trying to be something that they could never be, living in fantasy about themselves, seeing themselves in a role that really is not their destiny. People can pursue endlessly and doggedly a set of goals that does not represent the deeper need of their soul.</p>
<p>人们终其一生都在努力成为他们永远无法成为的人，生活在对他们自己的幻想中，看到他们自己扮演的角色其实并不是他们的天命。人们可以无休止地、执着地追求一系列目标，但这些目标并不代表他们灵魂更深层次的需求。</p>
<p>Here the more determined you are can end up casting you even further into a path with no future and no fulfillment. It is a misappropriation of your skills and talents, based upon a misunderstanding of your true direction.</p>
<p>在这里，你越是坚定，最终可能会把你推向一条没有未来、没有满足感的道路。这是对你技能和才能的滥用，是基于对你真实方向的错误理解。</p>
<p>That is why this deeper turning point is so important. People can become lost in the world and disheartened and disillusioned and feel empty and depressed because they have not reached this turning point within themselves. Perhaps they have exhausted their ambitions and through disappointment and dismay, they have been cast back upon themselves, but they have not reached this turning point where something deeper begins to emerge within them.</p>
<p>正因为如此，这个更深层次的转折点如此重要。人们可能迷失在世界上，灰心丧气，幻灭不已，感到空虚和沮丧，因为他们没有达到他们自己内心的这个转折点。或许他们已经耗尽了他们的野心，通过失望和沮丧，他们又回到了他们自己，但他们还没有达到这个转折点，在这个转折点，更深层次的内识开始在他们内心深处显现。</p>
<p>Do not judge people in this state. It is a very difficult state, and if it is prolonged, it can be a tragic state. Everyone is struggling to survive, and beyond this struggle to survive, they are struggling to find the truth about their lives. This struggle can lead people into many mistaken paths, can lead so many people astray, can lead to a kind of spiritual destitution.</p>
<p>不要评判处于这种状态的人。这是一种非常困难的状态，如果这种状态持续下去，可能会成为一种悲剧。每个人都在为生存而挣扎，除了这种生存的挣扎之外，他们还在努力寻找生命的真理。这种挣扎会把人们引向许多错误的道路，会让许多人误入歧途，会导致一种精神上的贫困。</p>
<p>For even if you are successful in reaching your material goals, even if you have achieved what your culture esteems to be a success, if you have not discovered your real purpose, then your soul’s need has gone unmet. And the feeling of emptiness, the feeling of unfulfillment, will haunt you. Achieving more goals or purchasing more things or conquering other people will not satisfy this deeper need of the soul.</p>
<p>因为即使你成功地实现了物质目标，即使你取得了你所在文化所认为的成功，如果你还没有发现你的真正目的，那么你灵魂的需求就得不到满足。空虚感、不满足感将困扰着你。实现更多目标、购买更多东西或征服其他人都无法满足灵魂的这种更深层次的需求。</p>
<p>That is why when some people reach a point of material success, they can fall into a great and seemingly endless depression, a kind of vacant state, where they are feeling the emptiness of their lives at a deeper level.</p>
<p>这就是为什么当有些人达到物质成功的程度时，他们就会陷入巨大的、似乎无休止的沮丧之中，一种空虚的状态，他们在更深层次的层面上感受到生命的空虚。</p>
<p>Here the only way out is through service, through a kind of selfless service. They recognize a need, and they support that need—using their assets, using their personal strength—and this becomes a path of redemption for them. Here every wealthy person must become a benefactor, not just giving some small portion of their wealth, but committing their wealth to serving a real need in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，唯一的出路是通过服务，通过一种无私的服务。他们认识到一种需求，并支持这种需求——使用他们的资产，使用他们的个人力量——这成为他们的救赎之路。在这里，每个富人都必须成为一位施恩者，不仅仅是捐出他们财富的一小部分，而是将他们的财富用于满足世界上的一种真正需求。</p>
<p>So the question arises: What does God will for me? Perhaps even if you are not religiously oriented or have not grown up in a religious family or environment, you might ask this question in some way. The question could be asked in many ways: What am I really here to do? What is my true path in life? Or What does God will for me? It is all the same question, you see.</p>
<p>因此，问题就出现了：上帝对我的意志是什么？即使你不是宗教信仰者，或者没有在宗教家庭或环境中长大，你也可能会以某种方式问这个问题。这个问题可以用很多方式来问：我在这里真正要做什么？我真实的生命道路是什么？或者上帝对我有什么旨意？你看，这些问题本质上是相同的。</p>
<p>People who have grown up in a religious environment will ask this question more immediately. And they will try to interpret their answer, perhaps, based upon their religious beliefs or the practices or trends of their tradition. But the answer reaches far deeper than this and is in a sense far more simple to comprehend.</p>
<p>在宗教环境中长大的人会更直接地提出这个问题。他们可能会试图根据他们的宗教信仰或传统习俗或趋势来解释他们的答案。但答案远比这深刻，而且从某种意义上来说更容易理解。</p>
<p>If you were sent into the world for a greater purpose, then God wills for you to find this purpose, to experience it, to accept it and to fulfill it. People think they must praise and worship, fall down on their knees and prostrate themselves to please God. Perhaps as a demonstration of humility, these forms of worship are appropriate as a sign of yielding one’s will to a greater Will. These forms of worship can be quite beneficial, but they do not please God.</p>
<p>如果你被派到这个世界上是为了一个更伟大的目的，那么上帝希望你找到这个目的，去体验它，接受它并实现它。人们认为他们必须赞美、敬拜、跪下、匍匐才能取悦上帝。也许作为一种谦逊的表现，这些形式的崇拜是适当的，作为将自己的意志顺从于更伟大意志的标志。这些崇拜形式可能非常有益，但它们并不能取悦上帝。</p>
<p>God does not need to be worshipped and acclaimed. God is not driven by the same kinds of needs of recognition that people, in a state of Separation and insecurity, tend to want for themselves. God does not need to be validated, for God is not insecure. God does not need to be worshipped because God does not suffer from a kind of low self-esteem. God does not need to be praised. What God needs is for you to fulfill what you came here to do. That is really the matter.</p>
<p>上帝不需要被崇拜和赞美。上帝并不被那些处于分离状态和不安全感状态的人们所渴望的那种认可需求所驱动。上帝不需要被认可，因为上帝并不缺乏安全感。上帝不需要被崇拜，因为上帝并不缺乏自尊。上帝不需要被赞美。上帝所需要的是你去实现你来到这里的目的。这才是真正的问题所在。</p>
<p>Even if you were not religious, even if you had no religious tradition or practice, if you could do that, from a position and attitude of service, you would fulfill your destiny here. You would break through the wall of Separation. You would follow the deeper Knowledge that God has given you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you forward.</p>
<p>即使你不信教，即使你没有宗教传统或实践，如果你能做到，从服务的立场和态度出发，你就能实现你在此的天命。你将突破分离之墙。你将遵循上帝赋予你的更深层次的内识，来指引你、保护你并引领你前行。</p>
<p>Even if you claimed you did not believe in God or were not religious, if you could do this in the spirit of service, following Knowledge within yourself, breaking free of personal self-obsession and addiction to serve in this way with courage, compassion and determination, you would fulfill your destiny here. And you would find a kind of satisfaction, and a rightness with yourself, and a deeper level of fulfillment that cannot be found in any other way.</p>
<p>即使你声称你不相信上帝或不信教，如果你能本着服务的精神做到这一点，遵循你内在的内识，摆脱个人的自我痴迷和沉迷，以这种方式带着勇气、同情心和决心去服务，你就会在这里实现你的天命。你会找到一种满足感，一种自我正确性，以及一种无法通过任何其他方式找到的更深层次的满足感。</p>
<p>God does not need a vast army of believers, all saying the same thing, all marching in step, all performing the same or similar acts of devotion. Fundamentally, God needs for you to discover Knowledge, to follow Knowledge, for this is what God has put within you—to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater life in the world and to a greater set of relationships that will enable you to find and to fulfill this purpose.</p>
<p>上帝不需要一支庞大的信徒大军，所有人都说着同样的话，所有人都步调一致，所有人都做着相同或相似的奉献行为。从根本上说，上帝需要你发现内识，遵循内识，因为这是上帝放置在你内心深处的内识——指引你、保护你、引领你走向你在世界上的更伟大生命以及一套将使你能够找到并实现这个目的的更伟大关系。</p>
<p>Here you are not redeemed by just believing in God, for belief is just a position of the mind. It is not deep enough to really establish the fulfillment and completion that you were sent here to establish and to fulfill.</p>
<p>在此，你不会因为相信上帝而得到救赎，因为信仰只是心灵的一种立场。它不够深刻，无法真正建立你被送到这里来实现和完成的那种圆满与成就。</p>
<p>Besides, God knows you could never get everyone to believe in the same things and that if you try, you will just end up oppressing people and punishing people, leading to a kind of self-righteous cruelty. This will be done in the name of God. People will be punished and executed in the name of God. And this is an abomination. This is such a great distortion.</p>
<p>此外，上帝知道你永远不可能让每个人都相信同样的事情，如果你尝试这样做，你最终只会压迫人民、惩罚人民，导致一种自以为是的残忍。这一切都是以上帝的名义进行的。人们将以上帝的名义受到惩罚和处决。这是一种令人憎恶的行为。这是一种巨大的扭曲。</p>
<p>God does not will punishment or death for anyone. God wills that all Beings in the world be redeemed and knows that the separated are reclaimed through Knowledge and through service.</p>
<p>上帝不希望任何人受到惩罚或死亡。上帝希望世界上所有的生命都得到救赎，并且知道分离的人可以通过内识和服务得到拯救。</p>
<p>You have come into the world at a time of profound need, and the needs of humanity will grow ever greater in the face of the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world: resource depletion, environmental decline and degradation, changing climate and catastrophic weather, growing political and economic instability, and the risk of war between nations and groups over who will claim the remaining resources. This will plunge humanity into a greater and deeper state of instability and uncertainty and give rise to many dangerous leaders coming to power.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界时正值一个深刻的需求时期，面对即将降临世界的变革巨浪，人类的需求将变得越来越大：资源枯竭、环境衰退和退化、气候变化和灾难性天气、日益加剧的政治和经济不稳定，以及国家和群体之间为争夺剩余资源而爆发战争的风险。这将使人类陷入一种更大、更深的不稳定和不确定状态，并导致许多危险领导人上台。</p>
<p>You have been sent into the world to serve the world under these circumstances. Accept this. To love the world, you must accept the world as it is. That does not mean you condone everything or justify the great wrongdoing and errors that are occurring here, but it means that you take a position of seeing how you can serve rather than merely being a critic, a person who casts condemnation upon the world.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界来，在这样的境况下服务世界。接受这一点。要爱这个世界，你必须接受世界本来的样子。这并不意味着你宽恕一切，或为这里发生的重大错误和过失辩解，而是意味着你采取一种立场，看看你如何能够服务，而不仅仅是一个批评家，一个谴责世界的人。</p>
<p>What people believe about God in so many instances, in so many traditions, is so completely incorrect. They are trying to fulfill their greater purpose by being good believers, but belief is not strong enough or consistent enough or free enough from manipulation and from error to assure that you will find your greater service here and perform it correctly to the benefit of others.</p>
<p>在许多情况下，在许多传统中，人们对上帝的信仰是完全错误的。他们试图通过做一个虔诚的信徒来实现他们更伟大的目的，但信仰并不足够强大、稳定，或者足够摆脱操控与错误，无法确保你在这里找到你的更伟大服务并正确地执行它，从而造福他人。</p>
<p>Many tyrants feel they are doing a great service to their people. Many cruel oppressors think they are bringing order and benefit to society. That is why a belief alone cannot be your guide. That is why God has given you a deeper Intelligence that is not influenced or seduced or dominated by human belief.</p>
<p>许多暴君认为他们为人民做出了一种伟大的贡献。许多残酷的压迫者认为他们正在给社会带来秩序和利益。这就是为什么信仰本身不能成为你的指南。这就是为什么上帝赋予你一种更深层次的智能，不受人类信仰的影响、诱惑或支配。</p>
<p>The power of belief is appropriate in trusting and honoring the presence of Knowledge within yourself, which at the outset in particular you may experience only very infrequently. But it is still enough to alter the course of your life and to set your life in a true direction.</p>
<p>信仰的力量适用于信任和尊重你内在内识的存在，特别是在一开始你可能很少体验到它。但它仍然足以改变你的生命轨迹，让你的生命走向正确的方向。</p>
<p>People try to comprehend God’s Will, Nature and Purpose with their intellect, to use belief and obedience and eccentricity to try to comprehend and to follow what they think God wants them to do. And many proclaim that the great Teachings that have come from the Emissaries answer these questions fully. But the real purpose that has brought you here cannot be defined by any tradition or simple set of ideas.</p>
<p>人们试图用他们的智力去理解上帝的意志、自然和目的，用信仰、服从和怪癖去理解和遵循他们认为上帝希望他们做的事情。许多人宣称，使者传授的伟大教导完全回答了这些问题。但你来到这里的真正目的不能用任何传统或简单的想法来定义。</p>
<p>Even the ideas We are giving you here require a deeper understanding and recognition and a commitment to adhere to a mysterious power within yourself that you cannot comprehend with your intellect, that you cannot concretely define. For to define something is to give it form and limitation, but Knowledge within you does not have form and exceeds beyond limitation.</p>
<p>即便是我们在此给予你的想法，也需要一种更深层次的理解和认知，以及对坚持你内在神秘力量的承诺，你无法用智力去理解，你无法具体地定义它。因为定义某样东西就是赋予它形式和限制，但你内在的内识没有形式，超越了限制。</p>
<p>The great traditions of humanity have given significant and necessary perspective and guidance in a general sense. Commandments have been given to guide human behavior in a general sense so that human civilization could be fostered and grow and expand without destroying itself. But beyond this, the revelation must happen within you. You must have your revelation, and you must bring yourself to it in a state of humility.</p>
<p>人类的伟大传统在一般意义上提供了重要且必要的视角和指导。诫命被赋予以在一般意义上指导人类行为，以便人类文明能够得到培育、成长和扩张而不会自我毁灭。但除此之外，启示必须在你内心发生。你必须拥有你的启示，并且必须以谦逊的状态将你自己带到它面前。</p>
<p>This is bringing yourself to the truth and yielding, but it is not simply an act you do once a week, or a social process, or a ceremony alone. It is something you must do within yourself.</p>
<p>这是带你自己面对真理并顺从真理，但它并不仅仅是你每周做一次的行为，也不是一个社交过程，更不是一个单独的仪式。这是你必须在你自己内心做的事情。</p>
<p>You are not asking for a distant God to give you guidance. You are asking for Knowledge within yourself to emerge, for God has already given you the perfect guiding Intelligence. Now you must discern it in your own experience.</p>
<p>你不是在请求远方的上帝指导你。你是在请求你自己内心深处的内识浮现，因为上帝已经给了你完美的指导智能。现在你必须在你自己的体验中辨别它。</p>
<p>You must distinguish it from your compulsions, your desires and your other needs. You must look for its evidence in your life and in the lives of others. You must stop condemning the world and humanity and begin to look and listen for the signs of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你必须将它与你的冲动、你的欲望和其他需求区分开来。你必须在你的生命中和他人的生命中寻找它的证据。你必须停止谴责世界和人类，开始寻找和聆听内识的迹象。</p>
<p>Your mind will want to give definition. It will want to rely upon beliefs and convictions and theories and laws because it is so insecure. It wants these things as a kind of crutch, as a handrail.</p>
<p>你的心灵会想要给出定义。它会想要依赖信仰、信念、理论和法律，因为它非常不安全。它想要这些东西作为一种拐杖，一种扶手。</p>
<p>But Knowledge is beyond the intellect because your true identity is beyond the intellect. Who you were before coming into this world and who you will be after you leave this world is beyond the reach and the domain of your intellect. Your intellect was created to communicate and to function within this limited reality called life in the world, but it cannot encompass the greater reality of your existence and the Greater Reality of Creation. Even the physical universe in all of its dimensions and expansions is only a part of Creation.</p>
<p>但是内识超越智力，因为你的真实身份超越了智力。你来到这个世界之前是谁，你离开这个世界之后会是谁，都超出了你的智力所能及和所能掌控的领域。你的智力被创造出来是为了在这个被称为世间生命的有限现实里交流和运作，但它无法涵盖你存在的更伟大现实和创造的更伟大现实。甚至物质宇宙在其所有维度和扩展中也只是创造的一部分。</p>
<p>Your intellect is an incredibly important tool of communication and evaluation. Within this world, within the world of changing circumstances, within a world where people do not recognize each other, in a world where you must survive and adapt and innovate, it is a marvelous instrument.</p>
<p>你的智力是沟通和评估的一个极其重要的工具。在这个世界上，在这个环境不断变化的世界上，在这个人们彼此不相识的世界上，在这个你必须生存、适应和创新的世界上，智力是一个了不起的工具。</p>
<p>But do not think that it can comprehend the meaning of life, or your greater purpose for coming into the world, or the nature and reality of those who sent you here. This must be revealed to you.</p>
<p>但不要认为智力能够理解生命的意义，或者你来到这个世界的更伟大目的，或者那些派你来到这里的不可见者的性质和现实。这必须向你揭示。</p>
<p>Do not try to make experience fit in with your ideas. Honor experience and allow it to shape your ideas. Do not take a profound experience and try to fit it in with your belief system. Let it exist outside your belief system to give you wisdom that your belief system cannot provide.</p>
<p>不要试图让经验与你的想法相契合。尊重经验，让它塑造你的想法。不要将一段深刻的体验符合你的信仰体系。让它存在于你的信仰体系之外，给你一种你的信仰体系无法提供的智慧。</p>
<p>This is humility. Insisting that your ideas be right and your beliefs be confirmed, that is arrogant. That is demanding that life and God conform to your ideas or the ideas of your culture or tradition. That is fundamentally arrogant and ignorant. It does not represent a position of humility or openness.</p>
<p>这就是谦逊。坚持你的想法是正确的，你的信仰是被确认的，这种行为是傲慢的。这就是要求生命和上帝符合你的想法，或者符合你文化或传统的想法。这从根本上来说是傲慢和无知的。它并不代表一种谦逊或开放的位置。</p>
<p>While you should not be open to all human ideas and accepting of all human beliefs, you must be open to the power and presence of Knowledge within your life, for this is how God will guide you and speak to you. But for this to be genuine, for you to have a real experience of this, you will have to see the difference between Knowledge and your beliefs.</p>
<p>虽然你不应该对所有人类的想法都保持开放，也不应该接受所有人类的信仰，但你必须对内识在你生命中的力量和存在保持开放，因为这是上帝引导你并与你对话的方式。但为了让这成为真实的，为了让你真正体验到这一点，你必须看到内识和你的信仰之间的区别。</p>
<p>This will take skill and maturity. Otherwise, you will claim that every idea that comes into your mind is God speaking to you. Everything you want for yourself is God speaking to you. Every judgment that you have against others is God speaking to you. This is so obviously incorrect and false.</p>
<p>这需要技巧和成熟度。否则，你会声称你心灵中出现的每一个想法都是上帝在与你讲话。你想要的一切都是上帝在与你讲话。你对他人的每一个评判都是上帝在对你讲话。这显然是错误的和虚假的。</p>
<p>So this takes a real high degree of self-honesty. That is why the great turning point of the emergence of Knowledge comes later in life for almost everyone. If you are deceptive here, you will deceive yourself and think you have found a truth that is really only the product of your self-deception. You will cling to some idea or belief, and it will block your path, and it will blind you. Even the light will blind you. You will feel you have found a great light, a great revelation. It will blind you. And it will not really be it.</p>
<p>因此，这需要真正高度的自我诚实。这就是为什么内识出现的伟大转折点几乎对每个人来说都是在生命的后期到来的。如果你在这里欺骗你自己，你就会自欺欺人，认为你找到了一个真理，而这个真理实际上只是你自我欺骗的产物。你会执着于某个想法或信念，它会阻碍你的道路，它会蒙蔽你。甚至光明也会蒙蔽你的双眼。你会觉得你找到了一束伟大的光明，一种伟大的启示。它也会蒙蔽你的双眼。而这并不是真正的光明。</p>
<p>That is why the student of Knowledge must proceed slowly and carefully, for there are many errors and traps along the way, and many people fall for these errors and fall into these traps because they are impatient, because they want self-validation, because they want to have their ideas, their beliefs and even their existence be confirmed. They are too impatient and too compulsive to allow the reality of their life to slowly emerge and be revealed to them.</p>
<p>正因为如此，内识学生必须缓慢而谨慎地前行，因为沿途有许多错误和陷阱，许多人陷入这些错误和陷阱，因为他们没有耐心，因为他们想要自我确认，因为他们想要让他们的想法、他们的信仰甚至他们的存在得到确认。他们太没有耐心，太强迫性，以至于不允许他们生命的现实缓慢地浮现并向他们揭示。</p>
<p>That is why the journey is a journey. It is not a moment where you discover everything. Even if you could see within a flash of light the reality of your existence, you would still have to interpret this and apply this in your everyday life and bring it into the context of all of your involvements.</p>
<p>这就是旅程之所以是旅程的原因。它不是你发现一切的时刻。即使你能在一瞬间看到你存在的现实，你仍然必须解释它，并在你的日常生活中运用它，并将其带入你所有参与的背景中。</p>
<p>People hope that revelation will be sudden for them so that they do not have to take the long journey. But the long journey is where you build wisdom and discernment, where you discern reality from illusion, truth from ideas alone.</p>
<p>人们希望启示突然降临，这样他们就不必长途跋涉。但正是在漫长的旅程中，你才能培养智慧和辨别力，才能分辨现实与幻象、真理与想法。</p>
<p>People are impatient because they are governed by the intellect, which is so profoundly insecure. It has not found its true service to Spirit, or to Knowledge, to God. It is trying to be a god itself. And while the intellect is a marvelous vehicle of communication, it makes a very poor god—weak, fallible, judgmental, arrogant, conceited, cruel. It makes a very poor god.</p>
<p>人们之所以急躁，是因为他们被极度缺乏安全感的智力所支配。智力尚未找到它对精神、对内识、对上帝的真实服务。智力试图成为神本身。智力虽然是一种奇妙的沟通工具，但它却是一位非常糟糕的神——软弱、易犯错误、妄加评判、傲慢、自负、残忍。它是一位非常糟糕的神。</p>
<p>People think God is like the intellect, just on a larger scale, containing all of the weaknesses and the dangerous dispositions of the intellect, and that God has all this. This has given rise to the vengeful God, the judgmental God, the punishing God, the God who sends people to eternal damnation, eternal suffering—a kind of immense ego.</p>
<p>人们认为上帝就像智力，只是规模更大，包含了智力的所有弱点和危险倾向，而上帝拥有这一切。这导致了复仇的上帝、审判的上帝、惩罚的上帝、将人们送入永恒诅咒、永恒痛苦的上帝——一种规模更大的自我。</p>
<p>Yet people insist that God is loving and all merciful, and so you can see the contradiction. This contradiction is apparent to many people who turn away from religion altogether because they see the falsity of these notions.</p>
<p>然而，人们却坚持认为上帝是慈爱的、仁慈的，因此你可以看到其中的矛盾。这种矛盾对于许多人来说是显而易见的，他们因为看到了这些观念的虚假性而彻底远离了宗教。</p>
<p>This Teaching We are giving you is part of God’s New Message for the world. Part of its purpose is to bring clarification, to teach about spirituality at the level of Knowledge, to reveal to you the real nature of redemption and fulfillment in the world.</p>
<p>我们给你的这个教导是上帝给世界的新讯息的一部分。它的目的之一是带来澄清，在内识层面教导精神性，向你揭示在世界中真正自然的救赎和满足感。</p>
<p>This Teaching has been part of all the great past traditions but has become lost and obscured because religions have become dominated by political forces and ambitious individuals. Their true message and their true power have been obscured in so many ways. People can still find the great truths and redemption through these traditions, but they must be very discerning. And the truth here can be difficult to find, given the persuasions of one’s culture, the weight of tradition and how their religious traditions are being taught and emphasized in their nations and cultures.</p>
<p>这个教导是过去所有伟大传统的一部分，但由于宗教被政治力量和野心勃勃的个人所主导，这个教导已逐渐失传和模糊。宗教的真实讯息和真实力量已在很多方面被模糊。人们仍然可以通过这些传统找到伟大的真理和救赎，但他们必须非常有辨别力。在这里，真理可能很难找到，因为一个人的文化影响、传统的重负以及他们的宗教传统在各自国家和文化中的教学和强调方式，都会对他们产生深刻影响。</p>
<p>That is why the New Message from God presents God’s intention in a pure form, unadulterated by the power of the state, unclaimed by governments, without human manipulation or domination.</p>
<p>正因为如此，来自上帝的新讯息以一种纯净的形式呈现了上帝的意图，不受国家权力的干扰，不受政府的宣称，不受人类的操纵或支配。</p>
<p>This is God’s Message in a pure form. This is meant to resonate with the purity of all the great traditions, for they were all initiated by God, and they were all changed by humanity. The truth can be found in all of them, but it takes a great effort and great mental freedom and great patience.</p>
<p>这是纯净形式的上帝讯息。这是为了与所有伟大传统的纯洁性产生共鸣，因为它们都是上帝发起的，也都是人类改变的。真理可以在所有这些传统中找到，但这需要付出伟大的努力、伟大的心理自由和伟大的耐心。</p>
<p>In all cases, it comes down to receiving revelation as it occurs at the very heart and center of your life and to follow revelation. For revelation is not just an idea or one consuming experience. It is a journey to take, a pathway to follow, a whole new stage of life where you are the student, the follower, who presumes very little, and who is open to learning everything that must be learned.</p>
<p>在所有情况下，归根结底都是接收启示，因为它发生在你生命的核心和中心，并遵循启示。因为启示不仅仅是一个想法或一次消耗性的体验。它是一段要走的旅程，一条要走的道路，一种全新的生命阶段，在这个阶段，你是学生，是追随者，你的假设很少，并且愿意学习一切必须学习的事物。</p>
<p>Here you are not bound by one belief system. You are not bound to recite one Teaching, for you are following the Mystery. And this is what the Mystics of all ages have followed.</p>
<p>在这里，你不受任何信仰体系的束缚。你不必背诵任何教导，因为你追随的是神秘。而这正是历代神秘主义者所追随的。</p>
<p>Beliefs and doctrines are for people who are not free enough to take the journey, who are held back by their cultures, by their economic position, who are oppressed by their nations and their leaders. Perhaps they have felt the stirrings of Knowledge within themselves, but they are too bound, too circumscribed by their situation. This is a condition of so many people in the world today.</p>
<p>信仰和教义是为那些不够自由踏上旅程的人准备的，他们被他们的文化、他们的经济位置所束缚，他们被他们的国家和他们的领导人所压迫。或许他们感受到了他们内在内识的骚动，但他们被他们的处境束缚得太紧、太局限了。这是当今世界上许多人的状况。</p>
<p>So many of humanity’s future great leaders, scientists, physicians and inventors are bound by grinding poverty or oppressed in oppressive regimes, and their greater gifts will not be discovered and expressed as a result.</p>
<p>许多人类未来的伟大领袖、科学家、医生和发明家都深陷贫困或遭受专制政权的压迫，他们的伟大礼物无法被发现和发挥。</p>
<p>Here is where poverty and oppression hold back the entire race, diminish the prospects for the human family. This is why women must be free to assume positions of leadership and power and innovation, for if you suppress half of humanity, you deny all of humanity half of what it could create and produce that would be entirely beneficial.</p>
<p>正是在这里，贫困和压迫阻碍了整个种族的发展，削弱了人类大家庭的前景。这就是为什么女性必须自由地担任领导、权力和创新职位，因为如果你压制了一半的人类，你就剥夺了全人类可以创造和生产的一半，而这些创造和生产将是完全有益的。</p>
<p>That is why circumstances must be conducive to the discovery of Knowledge. If you are oppressed by dire financial needs, if you are at the edge of survival trying to take care of a family, if you are living under severe restriction and oppression by your government or by your religious tradition, then the emergence of Knowledge may not occur, for the environment for its emergence is so unfavorable.</p>
<p>正因为如此，环境必须有利于内识的发现。如果你被迫切的财务需求所压迫，如果你在生存的边缘努力照顾家庭，如果你生活在政府或宗教传统的严重限制和压迫之下，那么内识的出现可能不会发生，因为它出现的环境是如此不利。</p>
<p>This is why political freedom is important. This is why certain traditions must be opened so that people can emerge, so that their gifts can be discovered and expressed. This is why poverty is a blight upon humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>这就是为什么政治自由如此重要。这就是为什么必须开放某些传统，以便人们能够脱颖而出，发现和表达他们的礼物。这就是为什么贫困是全人类的祸害。</p>
<p>Great religious and political leaders often emerge from very humble circumstances. And for the few who can escape these circumstances, they require great courage and assistance from others.</p>
<p>伟大的宗教和政治领袖往往出身卑微。而少数能够摆脱这种境遇的人，则需要极大的勇气和他人的帮助。</p>
<p>So when you ask yourself: What does God will for me? Or if you ask yourself: What am I really here to do? If you ask yourself: Am I living the life I was really meant to live? In all cases, you bring yourself to the power and the presence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>所以当你问你自己：上帝对我的意志是什么？或者如果你问你自己：我来到这里真正要做的是什么？如果你问你自己：我是否过着我真正应该过的生命？在所有情况下，你都会将你自己带入内识的力量和存在之中。</p>
<p>God is not managing your daily affairs. The Creator of the universe and Creation beyond the universe is not preoccupied with your hourly and daily life. Instead, God has planted a seed in you, a seed that can germinate and grow within you. This is the Wisdom of God.</p>
<p>上帝没有在管理你的日常事务。宇宙的创造者，以及宇宙之外的创造，并不关心你的每时每刻和日常生命。相反，上帝在你的内心深处种下了一颗种子，这颗种子可以在你内心发芽生长。这就是上帝的智慧。</p>
<p>So do not think that everything that happens is because God is making it happen, or God is manipulating every little thing that happens for your benefit or your edification. Do not think that God is managing all the affairs of life.</p>
<p>因此，不要认为发生的每一件事都是因为上帝在让它发生，或者上帝在操控每一个细节来为你的利益或提升而安排。不要认为上帝在管理生命中的一切事务。</p>
<p>God has created nature and evolution and the mechanisms of the natural world. You have entered this arena of great change and uncertainty. God has given you Knowledge. It is this Knowledge that is the key. To discern its reality, to feel its presence, to allow it to exert its influence over your thinking and emotions is really beginning to take the path of redemption.</p>
<p>上帝创造了自然、进化和自然世界的机制。你已经进入了这个充满巨大变化和不确定性的领域。上帝已经赋予了你内识。正是这个内识才是关键。辨别它的现实，感受它的存在，让它对你的思维和情感施加影响，才能真正开始踏上救赎之路。</p>
<p>Here, even, you cannot answer the question: “What does God will for me?” because you are taking a journey, and the journey is one of discovery, of coming to terms with the most fundamental realities of your life—to begin to value what is permanent and real over sensation and desires, fantasies and illusions; to discern what is good from what only looks good. To gain this discernment, this wisdom, this competence, this is necessary if you are to carry out a greater purpose and to be in real service to others in a way that is entirely redemptive for them and for you.</p>
<p>在此，你甚至无法回答这个问题：“上帝对我的意志是什么？”因为你在踏上一段旅程，这段旅程是一次发现之旅，是一次面对你生命最根本现实的旅程——开始珍视永恒和真实，而非感觉和欲望、幻想和幻觉；开始辨别什么是好的，什么只是看起来好。获得这种辨别力、这种智慧、这种能力，是必要的，如果你要实现更伟大的目的，以一种对他人和你自己都是完全救赎的方式为他人提供真正服务的话。</p>
<p>So the answer is not just an answer. It is a door that opens through which you must pass. It is a journey to take with many stages. And you take this journey still with great self-doubt and uncertainty, with questions unanswered, because you are living in the Mystery, and the Mystery is confounding to the intellect.</p>
<p>所以答案不仅仅是一个答案。它是一扇打开的门，你必须通过它。这是一段需要经历多个阶段的旅程。而你在这段旅程中仍然充满着巨大的自我怀疑和不确定性，问题尚未得到解答，因为你生活在神秘之中，而神秘让智力感到困惑。</p>
<p>Here the great uncertainty that underlies your intellect finds a greater power and a greater strength to rely upon within you. For, in essence, your body serves your mind, and your mind serves Spirit, or Knowledge. That is the true hierarchy of your Being.</p>
<p>在这里，你智力背后的巨大不确定性在你内心深处找到了一种更伟大的力量和一种更强的力量可以依靠。因为从本质上讲，你的身体服务于你的心灵，而你的心灵服务于精神或内识。这就是你存在的真实层级。</p>
<p>But this is not where people begin their journey. Most people begin their journey thinking that their mind serves their body and the Spirit serves their mind. People want to use Spirit as a kind of resource. They want to use Knowledge as a resource to get what they want.</p>
<p>但这并不是人们开始旅程的地方。大多数人在开始旅程时都认为他们的心灵服务于他们的身体，而精神服务于他们的心灵。人们想利用精神作为一种资源。他们想利用内识作为一种资源来获得他们想要的东西。</p>
<p>Most people start out in this profound state of confusion where the natural order of being within themselves is completely upside down. So it takes time to set everything right. In living in a state of Separation, almost everything becomes misconstrued, and there is great confusion.</p>
<p>大多数人一开始都处于这种极度混乱的状态，他们内心的自然秩序完全颠倒了。所以需要时间来纠正一切。生活在分离状态中，几乎所有事情都会被错误解释，而且非常混乱。</p>
<p>Here underneath the most adamant set of beliefs that people will adhere to and pronounce, there is a whole foundation of confusion and misunderstanding. And people adhere to extreme views to try to escape confusion and misunderstanding, but all they do is overlay it without resolving it fundamentally.</p>
<p>在人们坚持和宣扬的最坚定的信念之下，隐藏着一整套混乱和错误理解。人们坚持极端观点，试图摆脱混乱和错误理解，但他们所做的只是掩盖它，而不是从根本上解决它。</p>
<p>The only thing that can really resolve your core confusion and misunderstanding is the emergence of Knowledge within yourself. And here you must follow like a student. You cannot be a leader. Here you must yield your intellect to a mysterious power that you will perhaps only experience periodically, but it will be enough to lead you forward. Here you give up your reliance upon your beliefs and ideas and place a greater confidence in this power that is so consistent and so free from manipulation in the world—a deeper conscience within yourself, where what is right and wrong is just clear.</p>
<p>唯一能够真正解决你内心核心困惑和误解的事情，是内识在你内心深处的呈现。在此你必须像一名学生一样跟随。你无法成为一个领导者。在此你必须将你的智力交给一种神秘的力量，你或许只会周期性地体验到它，但它足以引领你前进。在此你放弃对你的信仰和想法的依赖，对这种如此始终如一、如此不受世界操纵的力量寄予一种更大的信心——你内心深处的一种更深层次的良知，在更深层次的良知中什么是对什么是错都是清晰的。</p>
<p>This is how God leads you out of your dilemma, the massive confusion and uncertainty of your life. This is how God frees you from a past full of error and misappropriation. This is how God saves you.</p>
<p>上帝就是这样引领你走出困境，走出你生命中的巨大困惑和不确定性。上帝就是这样把你从充满错误和挪用的过去中解放出来的。这就是上帝拯救你的方式。</p>
<p>Whether you are an advocate or a participant in a religious tradition or not, this is how God saves you. If you are a firm believer in your religious tradition, here Knowledge will emerge and reveal to you the real nature and the real essence of your religious tradition. For all religious traditions are essentially designed to bring your mind in service to Knowledge.</p>
<p>无论你是否是宗教传统的倡导者或参与者，这都是上帝拯救你的方式。如果你是你的宗教传统的坚定信徒，内识就会在此浮现并向你揭示你的宗教传统的真正自然和真正精髓。因为所有宗教传统本质上都是为了让你的心灵服务于内识而设计的。</p>
<p>This is where redemption occurs. This is where lives are renewed. This is where strength is discovered. This is where purpose and commitment can arise in the most beneficial ways.</p>
<p>这就是救赎发生的地方。这就是生命焕发新生的地方。这就是力量被发现的地方。在这里，目的和承诺能够以最有益的方式产生。</p>
<p>What does God will for you? God wills that you respond to Knowledge; that you allow Knowledge to redirect your life and to bring clarity into your situation; that you follow like a student, without presumption or demands; that you follow The Way of Knowledge; that you learn of the Mystery, without profaning it by trying to define it and use it as a tool; that you become truly honest with yourself and your intentions and that all of your decisions are brought to a deeper conscience within yourself, where you can discern what is real from what is unreal, what is true from what is untrue, what is right for you from what is not right for you.</p>
<p>上帝对你的意志是什么？上帝的意志是你对内识做出回应；希望你允许内识改变你的生命方向，让你的处境变得清晰；希望你像学生一样跟随，不带任何假设或要求；希望你遵循内识之路；希望你学习神秘，不试图定义它、不将其当作工具而亵渎它；希望你对你自己和你的意图真正诚实，希望你所有的决定都带入你内心深处更深层次的良知之中，在那里你可以辨别什么是真实的，什么是虚假的，什么是正确的，什么是不正确的，什么对你是合适的，什么对你是不合适的。</p>
<p>Here it is a journey of many steps, taking the Steps to Knowledge. Every Step is important. Every Step requires care and discernment. Every Step builds your strength, your inner certainty and your connection to Knowledge. Every Step clarifies your thinking, moderates and adjusts your beliefs, tempers your extreme notions and frees you from compulsion and addiction.</p>
<p>这是一段许多步骤的旅程，开展内识的进阶。每一步都很重要。每一步都需要谨慎和辨别。每一步都会增强你的力量、你的内在确定性和你与内识的联接。每一步都会澄清你的思维，缓和和调整你的信念，缓和你的极端观念，让你摆脱强迫和成瘾。</p>
<p>God wills that you follow this and find this and honor this in yourself and in other people. God wills that humanity establish a greater unity and cooperation to face the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, and to face the reality of your emergence into a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe, and to protect this world from Intervention from other races who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>上帝希望你在你自己和他人身上遵循这一点、发现这一点并尊重这一点。上帝希望人类建立一种更伟大的团结与合作，以面对正在降临世界的变革巨浪，面对你们迈进宇宙智能生命大社区的现实，保护这个世界免遭其他种族的干预，这些种族来此是为了利用软弱和分裂的人类。</p>
<p>God wills that you experience the purpose that has brought you here, and to follow it and to learn of it; to allow it to be revealed to you, step by step; to assume a position of integrity and humility, but commitment and determination; to stay true to this guiding light and to follow the compass that is setting a direction within you.</p>
<p>上帝希望你体验到你来到这里的目的，并追随它、学习它；让它一步步地向你揭示；保持完整性和谦逊，但要忠诚和坚定；忠于这盏指路明灯，追随你内心指引方向的指南针。</p>
<p>Follow this, honor this and encourage this in others, and your life will reflect your greater life beyond. And your sense of Separation from God and from your Ancient Home will begin to disappear.</p>
<p>遵循这一点，尊重这一点，并鼓励他人做到这一点，你的生命将反映出你生命之外的更伟大生命。你与上帝和古老家园的分离感将开始消失。</p>
