<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on November 21, 2008 in Seattle, Washington<br>2008年11月21日，在华盛顿州西雅图(Seattle, Washington)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In facing a world of diminishing resources and ever-increasing political and economic instability, one of the things that becomes essential to provide stability and security for yourself and your family is to simplify your situation.</p>
<p>面对一个资源日益减少、政治和经济日益不稳定的世界，要为你自己和你的家人提供稳定和安全的至关重要的事情之一，就是简化你的处境。</p>
<p>Simplicity here becomes not merely a valued perspective, but an essential component for how you live. For in the future everything will become more expensive. This will force people to live in a more simple manner, to value their relationships with one another more than their possessions, and to focus on things that are fundamental to life and to the enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>简单性在这里不仅是一种有价值的观点，而是你生活方式的重要组成部分。因为在未来，一切都将变得更加昂贵。这将迫使人们以更加简单的方式生活，更重视彼此之间的关系而不是财产，并专注于那些对生命至关重要且能够带来生活乐趣的事物。</p>
<p>The difficulties you will encounter in the world around you will remind you of the importance of simplicity. Simplicity is not merely owning fewer things. It really has to do with how much energy it requires for you to live your life and how many resources it requires for you to maintain where you live, how you live, how you travel about and your other activities and so forth.</p>
<p>你在周围世界遇到的困难会提醒你简单性的重要性。简单性不仅仅是拥有更少的东西。它真正关系到你的生命需要多少能量，你需要多少资源来维持你的居住地、你的生活方式、你的旅行方式以及你的其他活动等等。</p>
<p>You are entering a time of restraint, a time for saving, a time when your economy will require you to be far more careful with your resources. Though this seems restraining and disappointing perhaps at the outset, it offers you immense benefits along the way. It gives you the opportunity to cultivate a deeper relationship with yourself and with the people with whom you are engaged and with your ability to simply enjoy the moment, to enjoy life and nature. It gives you time, time which is precious, which has a greater purpose to serve.</p>
<p>你正在进入一个克制的时期，一个储蓄的时期，一个你的经济需要你更加谨慎地使用资源的时期。尽管这在一开始可能看起来是克制和令人失望的，但它会一路给你带来极大的益处。它让你有机会培养与你自己和与你交往的人的一种更深层次的关系，让你有能力简单地享受当下，享受生命和自然。它给了你时间，宝贵的时间，有一个更伟大目的可以服务。</p>
<p>This will be a time of restraint and contraction, a time of great uncertainty and instability. The less burden you have to carry regarding your possessions and regarding relationships that you are engaged in that have no real value or purpose, the more energy you will have and the more resources you will have internally to consider what you must do.</p>
<p>这将是一个节制和收缩的时期，一个充满巨大不确定性和不稳定性的时期。你对物质财产的负担越轻，对那些没有真正价值或目的的关系越少投入，你就会拥有更多的能量和内在资源，去思考你必须做的事情。</p>
<p>People, however, who are terribly encumbered by the way they live and by their obligations to other people will find very little freedom of movement here and will generally feel quite oppressed by the events that are transpiring around them.</p>
<p>然而，那些被他们的生活方式和对他人的义务所严重束缚的人们会发现在这里几乎没有行动的自由，并且通常会对周围发生的事件感到相当压抑。</p>
<p>Yet there is a greater dimension to simplicity and that has to deal with your internal state—your experience of your mind, your feelings, emotions and your ability to be with your deeper experience.</p>
<p>然而，简单性还有一种更伟大的维度，它与你的内在状态有关——你对你的心灵、你的感受和情绪的体验，以及你与你的更深层次体验共处的能力。</p>
<p>Most people live in a state of avoidance regarding their inner life—constantly driven, constantly preoccupied, constantly challenged and constantly stimulated by their personal interests. They have very little engagement with themselves at a deeper level.</p>
<p>大多数人都对他们的内在生命避而不谈——他们总是被个人利益所驱使、所困扰、所挑战、所刺激。他们很少与他们自己进行一种更深层次层面上的接触。</p>
<p>Their distractions and their preoccupations might seem practically justified, but in the end it leaves them estranged from themselves, unwilling and unable to discern their deeper insights. It leaves them without skill in comprehending their own experience.</p>
<p>他们的分心和专注似乎在实践中是合理的，但最终却使他们与他们自己疏远，不愿也无法辨别他们更深层次的洞察力，这让他们无法理解他们自己的经历。</p>
<p>With fewer distractions on the outside, fewer pursuits, fewer obsessions and fewer demands, it gives you time to build a deeper connection with yourself. What does this mean, a deeper connection with yourself? What this really means is building a connection with a deeper Intelligence within yourself, an Intelligence called Knowledge.</p>
<p>外界干扰减少，追求减少，执念减少，要求减少，你就有时间与你自己建立一种更深层次的联接。与你自己建立一种更深层次的联接意味着什么？这实际上意味着与你自己内在的一种更深层次的智能建立联接，这个智能被称为内识。</p>
<p>For you live with two minds. You have your surface mind, your social mind—a mind that has been conditioned and shaped by your environment and your relationships since the day you were born. This mind is inflexible. It is conditioned. It is not free. It is full of needs and anxieties, fears and fantasies. It is unstable. It is restless. It anticipates loss. It fears loss. And it tries to lose itself in hobbies, obsessions and other fantasies. It is unstable because it does not have a greater power within you to serve.</p>
<p>因为你生活在两个心灵之中。你有你的表面心灵，你的社会心灵——这个心灵自从你出生那天起就被你的环境和你的关系所制约和塑造。这个心灵是僵化的的。它是条件化的，它不是自由的。它充满了需求和焦虑、恐惧和幻想。它是不稳定的。它是焦躁不安的。它预期着损失。它害怕着损失。它试图在爱好、痴迷和其他幻想里迷失它自身。它是不稳定的，因为它内在没有一种更伟大的力量可以服务于你。</p>
<p>Yet this surface mind is a magnificent instrument of communication. It is a fabulous vehicle to be in the world. But its real value, its real merits and its greater potential can only be seen in service to a greater power within you.</p>
<p>然而，这个表面心灵是一种绝佳的沟通工具。它是存在于这个世界上的绝妙载体。但它的真正价值、真正的优点和更大的潜力只能在服务于你内心一种更伟大的力量时才能显现出来。</p>
<p>At a deeper level, beneath the surface of the mind, there is a great well of silence—a place of peace, a place of discernment, a place to reconsider what you are doing and why you are doing it. Within this well of silence, there is a deeper Intelligence—an Intelligence placed there by God, a mind that knows.</p>
<p>在一个更深层次的层面上，在心灵的表面之下，有一口伟大的寂静之井——一个和平的地方，一个辨别力的地方，一个重新考虑你在做什么以及为什么要这样做的地方。在这口寂静之井里，有一种更深层次的智能——一种上帝放置在那里的智能，一个知道的心灵。</p>
<p>This mind is very different from your surface mind. It does not compare. It does not contrast. It does not speculate. It does not evaluate. It does not project blame. It is not caught up in concepts, beliefs or theories. It is a powerful, penetrating Intelligence. It is not afraid of the world, and it is not confused about who you are and what you are here to accomplish. In this, it holds your greater purpose for being here and the recognition of all those individuals who will play a role in the discovery and the expression of this greater purpose.</p>
<p>这个心灵与你的表面心灵截然不同。它不比较。它不对比。它不推测。它不评价。它不投射责备。它不陷于概念、信仰或理论。它是一种强大、具有穿透力的智能。它不惧怕世界，它对你是谁以及你来此要完成什么不感到困惑。在这一点上，它持有着你存在的更伟大目的，并认知到那些将在发现和表达这个更伟大目的过程中扮演角色的个体。</p>
<p>To build a deeper relationship with yourself, then, is to build a connection to Knowledge and to allow Knowledge to counsel you, to guide you, to hold you back, to move you forward and to teach you how to discern and navigate the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>因此，建立与你自己的一种更深层次的关系，就是建立和内识的一种联接，并让内识给你提供建议、指导你、阻碍你、推动你前行，并教你如何辨识和驾驭你生命不断变化的境况。</p>
<p>Within yourself, this is simplicity. Here you are not trying to satisfy each of your desires. You are not a group of sub-personalities all with conflicting issues and demands.</p>
<p>在你自己的内心，这就是简单性。在这里，你不会试图满足你的每一个欲望。你不是一群有着相互冲突的问题和要求的子人格。</p>
<p>Instead, you are a great Being with a mind that needs to come into focus and that needs to have purpose and direction to be of great service to you and to others. Here you are not a complex set of different personalities. You are one Being—with one power, one motivation and one direction in life.</p>
<p>相反，你是一个伟大的存在，你的心灵需要聚焦，需要有目的和方向，以便为你和他人提供伟大的服务。在这里，你不是一系列复杂的不同人格。你是一个存在——拥有一种力量、一种动力和一种生命方向。</p>
<p>Freedom here is not the freedom to be chaotic. It is not the freedom to be disassociated from yourself and others. It is not the freedom to lose yourself in fantasy or to give your life to things that have no value, no purpose and no meaning.</p>
<p>这里的自由不是混乱的自由。这里的自由不是脱离你自己和他人的自由。它不是在幻想中迷失你自己的自由，也不是为没有价值、没有目的、没有意义的事情失去生命的自由。</p>
<p>Instead, freedom is the freedom to find and to follow Knowledge, to really be true to yourself and to be true to what is really true within yourself. This is simplicity within you.</p>
<p>相反，自由是找到并追随内识的自由，是真正忠于你自己的自由，是忠于你自己内心真正真实的内识的自由。这就是你内在的简单性。</p>
<p>You have conflicting desires, and you have oppositions within yourself primarily because of what you have absorbed from your environment. But to an even greater extent, you are frustrated and conflicted because you have not found your greater work in the world yet. And so the unique nature of your design and makeup have not really found their real context for expression. In other words, you were designed for something very specific, but if you have not found that, then your design will be confusing and will seem to be out of harmony with your current circumstances.</p>
<p>你的欲望相互冲突，你的内心相互对立，这主要是因为你从环境中吸收了一些东西。但在更大程度上，你之所以感到沮丧和矛盾，是因为你还没有找到你在世界上的更伟大工作。因此，你的设计和构成的独特自然还没有真正找到它们真正的表达背景。换句话说，你是为某种非常特定的目的而设计的，但如果你没有找到它，那么你的设计就会令人困惑，看起来与你目前的情况不协调。</p>
<p>Therefore, conflicts exist within you, but that does not mean you must resolve them all, or concentrate on them all or try to follow every motivation within yourself, which will only lead you into great confusion and the attempt to live many different lives at once.</p>
<p>因此，你的内心存在着冲突，但这并不意味着你必须解决所有的冲突，或集中能量处理所有冲突，或试图遵循你自己内心的每一个动机，这只会让你陷入极大的困惑，并试图同时过着多种不同的生命。</p>
<p>In your surface mind, there is complexity; there is confusion. There are different voices, different motivations, different ideas, different passions. But at the level of Knowledge deep within you, there is one focus and one direction.</p>
<p>在你的心灵表面，存在着复杂性；存在着困惑。存在着不同的声音、不同的动机、不同的想法、不同的激情。但在你内心深处的内识层面，只有一个焦点和一个方向。</p>
<p>You can see here where simplicity really exists, and with simplicity comes power. Power is a function of concentration, and Knowledge within you is extremely concentrated, so concentrated it is that it has the power to effect real change in the world and to impact the lives of others in the most potent and meaningful way.</p>
<p>你可以在这里看到，真正的简单性是如何存在的，而简单性带来了力量。力量取决于专注，而你内在的内识是极其集中的，它如此集中以至于它有能力真正改变世界，并以最有力和最有意义的方式影响他人的生命。</p>
<p>Do not think simplicity is being stupid or ignorant or unintelligent. No, indeed. To be simple is to be potent, to be focused, to be powerful and to be effective. Even if you are serving an unworthy cause, even if you were a destructive force in the world, if you are concentrated, then you have power and persuasion around others who are far less focused and concentrated than you.</p>
<p>不要认为简单就是愚蠢、无知或不智能。事实上，简单意味着强大、专注、有力和有效。即使你在为一个不值得的事业服务，即使你是世界上的一种破坏性力量，如果你保持专注，那么你就拥有力量和说服力，能够影响那些远不如你专注和集中注意力的人。</p>
<p>But Knowledge is a great power that is entirely ethical. It is only here to serve a greater and more meaningful purpose. It will give you the strength to overcome other persuasions, distractions and seductions. And it will give you the power to pass through your own confusion and disabling emotions to establish and maintain a greater focus in your life.</p>
<p>但内识是一种完全合乎道德的伟大力量。它存在的唯一目的就是服务于一个更伟大、更有意义的目的。它将赋予你力量去克服其他说服、干扰和诱惑。它将赋予你力量去穿越你自己的困惑和无能情绪，从而确立并维持你生命中一种更伟大的焦点。</p>
<p>Here instead of trying to create your own reality, you are beginning to discover the reality that already exists within you, and with that, the Reality that created you. Here if you can discern your design, you can begin to experience your Designer.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再试图创造你自己的现实，而是开始发现你内心已经存在的现实，以及创造你的现实。在这里，如果你能辨别你的设计，你就能开始体验你的设计师。</p>
<p>Simplicity here is to be one person in all situations, to have one great power, to have your life focused and set in a determined direction. Here your mind serves your Being as it was designed to do. Here your body serves your mind as it was designed to do. Here everything begins to fall into place, and a true harmony becomes evident.</p>
<p>这里的简单性是指在任何情况下都是一个人，拥有一种伟大的力量，让你的生命专注并朝着一个确定的方向发展。在这里，你的心灵按照设计的方式服务于你的存在。在这里，你的身体按照设计的方式服务于你的心灵。在这里，一切都开始步入正轨，真正的和谐变得显而易见。</p>
<p>But at the outset, everything seems upside down and confused. In your thinking, your mind is serving your body, and you think the Spirit should serve your mind.</p>
<p>但一开始，一切似乎都是颠倒的、混乱的。在你的思维中，你的心灵服务于你的身体，而你认为精神应该服务于你的心灵。</p>
<p>People think God should serve their mind when in fact their mind has only been created to be a servant within itself.</p>
<p>人们认为上帝应该服务于他们的心灵，但事实上，他们的心灵被创造出来只是做它自身的服务者。</p>
<p>So at the outset everything is confused and confusing because everything is out of order. You are dominated by your feelings, your thoughts, your fears, your desires, your ambitions and the persuasions of others to whom you have given authority in your life. From where you start, everything is out of order, and the true alignment of your body, your mind and your Spirit has not yet been established.</p>
<p>因此，一开始一切都是混乱和令人困惑的，因为一切都是无序的。你被你的感觉、你的思想、你的恐惧、你的欲望、你的野心和你赋予你生命权威的其他人的说服所支配。从你开始的地方，一切都是无序的，你的身体、你的心灵和你的精神的真正协调还没有建立起来。</p>
<p>So when you face disorder in your life, you experience it, and it can be quite disconcerting. When you realize how unfree you really are, despite whatever political freedom you might enjoy, it will be shocking and dismaying. To see how you have been a slave to your conditioning and to the desires and expectations of others is a shocking revelation. It is more than one revelation; it is a series of revelations.</p>
<p>因此，当你面对你生命中的无序时，你会体验到它，它会让你感到相当不安。当你意识到你实际上是多么不自由时，尽管你可能享有政治上的自由，这也会让你感到震惊和沮丧。看到你是如何成为你的条件、他人的欲望和期望的奴隶，是一个令人震惊的启示。它不仅仅是一个启示，而是一系列的启示。</p>
<p>When you see how little you have responded to the deeper voice within yourself, it will be very disappointing and frustrating for you. But this reckoning must take place, or you will never embark on your greater journey here in life.</p>
<p>当你看到你对你自己内心更深层次声音的回应是如此之少时，你会非常失望和沮丧。但这种清算必须发生，否则你将永远无法踏上你生命中更伟大的旅程。</p>
<p>Within this understanding, then, the declining resources of the world and the growing political and economic instability around you become a motivation for you to be grounded in Knowledge, to be deeply connected with the guiding power and presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此，在这种理解下，世界资源的不断减少以及你周围政治和经济的日益不稳定，反而成为你扎根于内识的动力，让你与内识的指导力量和存在建立深刻的连接。</p>
<p>For you realize that, based upon your beliefs and assumptions alone, you will not know what to do in the face of great change. And you will not know how to navigate the changing and unpredictable circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>因为你意识到，仅凭你的信念和假设，你将不知道在巨大的变化面前该做什么。你也不知道如何应对生命中变化莫测的环境和不确定的情况。</p>
<p>You will be driven by fear. You will be driven by desire. You will be driven by the need to escape and lose yourself somewhere else. Your emotions will be unstable. Your mind will be governed by the winds of the world. You will feel like a victim. You will be angry. You will be resentful. You will be condemning towards others. You will be completely affected by the instability of the world around you, and this instability will be the result of you not finding your real bearings, of not being grounded in Knowledge.</p>
<p>你将被恐惧所驱使。你将被欲望所驱使。你将被逃避的需求所驱使，试图将你自己丢失在别处。你的情绪将不稳定。你的心灵将被世界的疾风所支配。你会觉得自己是个受害者。你会感到愤怒。你会感到怨恨。你会对他人进行指责。你将完全受到周围世界不稳定性的影响，而这种不稳定性正是因为你没有找到真正的方向、没有扎根于内识的结果。</p>
<p>It is strange, but uncertainty around you actually is conducive to the emergence of Knowledge. For when everything is going the way people want it to go, they fall asleep; they become complacent and indulgent. They become lazy and do not question their lives significantly enough to gain any deeper connection within themselves. But when things are unstable and uncertain, then people are much more wary and have a much greater possibility of engaging in a deeper inquiry about the purpose and the direction of their life.</p>
<p>它是奇怪的，但你周围的不确定性实际上有助于内识的显现。因为当一切都按照人们想要的方式进行时，人们就会陷入昏睡；他们会变得自满和放纵。他们会变得懒惰，不会对他们的生命提出足够的质疑，也不会获得他们自己任何更深层次的内在联接。但当事情变得不稳定和不确定时，人们会变得更加警觉，更有可能对他们生命的目的和方向进行更深入的一种探索。</p>
<p>Here the pursuit of happiness becomes blinding, and it becomes very compromising to one’s integrity because in the pursuit of happiness, you only want to see, know and experience certain things and try to avoid and deny everything else. But what you avoid and deny is so much a part of life and such an important part of life that you end up becoming dishonest with yourself and with others.</p>
<p>在这里，对幸福的追求变得盲目，并且会严重损害一个人的完整性，因为在追求幸福的过程中，你只想看见、知道和体验特定的事情，并试图避免和否认其他一切。但你所避免和否认的事情是生命的一部分，也是生命的重要组成部分，以至于你最终对你自己和他人不诚实。</p>
<p>Here you are avoiding not only unpleasant circumstances, but you are avoiding a major part of your own experience that is actually instructing you and giving you messages and signs. When the possibility of attaining happiness looks more remote or difficult to obtain, then you will have a greater position of self-honesty and a greater opportunity to see and feel the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>在这里，你不仅回避了不愉快的环境，而且在逃避你自己体验中实际上在指导你、给你讯息和迹象的大部分内识。当获得幸福的可能性看起来更加遥远或难以获得时，你就会拥有更大的自我诚实的位置，以及更大的机会去看到和感受到你生命中更深层次的潮流。</p>
<p>You did not come into the world simply to go into repose and be self-satisfied. You came here to accomplish something unique and specific in concert with certain other individuals whom you are destined to meet. And they are destined to meet you. But destiny can be thwarted and avoided. Great encounters can be missed. And a greater purpose can yet remain unrecognized and unfulfilled.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界，并不只是为了安息和自我满足。你来到这里，是为了与其他一些你注定要遇到的人一起完成一些独特而具体的事情。他们注定要与你相遇。但是，天命是可以阻挠和避免的。伟大的邂逅可能会被错过。而更伟大的目的可能仍未被发现和实现。</p>
<p>In denial and avoidance, there is complexity. There is confusion. There is dishonesty. There is self-deception and deception by others. In this state, you are prone to be manipulated by others and by the promises of wealth, peace and happiness that have no real foundation in the world.</p>
<p>在否认和回避中，存在着复杂性。存在着困惑。存在着不诚实。存在着自欺欺人和被人欺骗。在这种状态下，你很容易被他人操纵，被世界上没有真正基础的财富、和平和幸福的承诺所操纵。</p>
<p>If you are going to face the truth, it means you must face everything. If you are going to know the real purpose and meaning of your life, you must truly face your current condition with as much courage and objectivity as you can.</p>
<p>如果你要面对真理，就意味着你必须面对一切。如果你想知道你生命的真正目的和意义，就必须以最大的勇气和最客观的态度真正面对你当前的现状。</p>
<p>Here there are no justifications and excuses. There is only a deeper reckoning and evaluation. It is like sorting out your closet, where you have been stuffing things for years, and now you have to go sort everything out. What are you going to keep and what are you going to discard? What really has use and what is just taking up time and energy in your life? What serves a real purpose and what is merely an artifact from your past?</p>
<p>这里没有辩解和借口。只有一种更深入的清算和评估。这就像是在整理你的衣柜，你多年来一直把衣服塞在里面，现在你必须把所有的东西都整理出来。哪些是你要保留的，哪些是你要丢弃的？哪些是真正有用的，哪些只是在占用你的时间和能量？哪些东西有真正的用途，哪些只是过去的工艺品？</p>
<p>Your deeper evaluation within yourself is like this. It is a sorting out. What is real and meaningful and what is not? What will you really need now and what can you do without? What is giving you energy and what is taking energy away from you?</p>
<p>你对你自己内心的更深入评估就像是这样。这是一种梳理。什么是真正的、有意义的，什么是没有意义的？什么是你现在实际需要的，什么是你可以不要的？什么会给你带来能量，什么会消耗你的能量？</p>
<p>Regarding your relationships, who can journey with you now in discovering and following Knowledge? And who is in fact holding you back and discouraging you? There are no neutral parties regarding this deeper discovery. Everyone is either helping you or hindering you in finding your true way and in gaining your real strength.</p>
<p>关于你的人际关系，现在谁能陪你一起发现和追随内识？谁实际上在拖累你、打击你？在这个更深层次的探索中，没有中立的一方。每个人要么在帮助你，要么在阻碍你找到真实的道路，获得你真正的力量。</p>
<p>Here your beliefs, assumptions and attitudes become secondary to the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself. Here you will not rely upon your assumptions, as you did before. You will not try to use everyone and everything to reinforce your beliefs, as you did before. You will not waste your energy condemning other people and being critical of the world, the way you were before.</p>
<p>在这里，你的信仰、假设和态度变得次于你内在内识的力量和存在。在这里，你不会再像以前那样依赖你的假设。你不会再像以前那样，试图利用所有人和所有事来强化你的信念。你不会再像以前那样，浪费你的能量去谴责他人和批判世界。</p>
<p>You are finding a very different way of being within yourself, and this leads to a different way of being in the world. Here you are looking for what is meaningful and essential with the understanding that everything that is not, are merely things that are either in your way or are major distractions.</p>
<p>你正在你自己的内心找到了一种截然不同的存在方式，而这又会带领你以另一种方式存在于这个世界。在这里，你寻找的是有意义的、必不可少的内识，同时理解，所有那些不具备意义的事物，都只是阻碍你前进或让你分心的障碍。</p>
<p>Here you look for Knowledge and the signs of Knowledge within people. As you do so, the seductions of beauty, wealth and charm lose their appeal and are seen for the pathetic nature that they really are. Here you value real communication with people and experiencing a deeper resonance with people, rather than being charmed, stimulated or seduced by them.</p>
<p>在这里，你寻找内识以及人们内在内识的迹象。当你这样做时，美貌、财富和魅力的诱惑将失去吸引力，并显露出其真正可悲的本质。在这里，你重视与人们真正的交流，体验与人们的一种更深层次的共鸣，而不是被他们的魅力、刺激或诱惑所吸引。</p>
<p>As you build your foundation in Knowledge, as you take the Steps to Knowledge, it changes your relationship with everything because your fundamental relationship with yourself has undergone a great shift, a necessary transition from being a slave to your own conditioning, fears and desires to being guided by the power that God has placed within you.</p>
<p>当你在内识中建立你的基础时，当你开展内识的进阶时，它会改变你与一切事物的关系，因为你与你自己的根本关系发生了一次伟大的转变，一次必要的转变，从做你自己习惯、恐惧和欲望的奴隶，转变为被上帝放置在你内在的力量所引导。</p>
<p>Here it is far more important to follow the purpose that you already carry than it is to worship God or to prostrate yourself at the altar or to give God glory. Because if you are not following what God has sent you here to do, if you are not following the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you, then all of this praise and worship is merely a compensation for something that is really failing in your life.</p>
<p>在这里，遵循你内心已经携带的目的，比崇拜上帝、匍匐在祭坛前或荣耀上帝重要得多。因为如果你没有遵循上帝让你来到这个世界上要做的事情，如果你没有遵循上帝放置在你内心深处的更深层次的内识，那么所有的赞美和崇拜不过是对你生命中真正失败之处的补偿。</p>
<p>You really honor God by carrying out what God sent you here to do to the best of your ability. Even if you are not religious, even if you do not think about God, even if you do not practice any tradition, you honor God by following Knowledge.</p>
<p>你真正尊崇上帝的方式是尽最大努力去完成上帝让你来到这里要做的事情。即使你不是宗教信徒，即使你不思考上帝，即使你不遵循任何传统，你仍然会通过遵循内在的内识来尊崇上帝。</p>
<p>Here you begin to see that belief is only a substitute for Knowledge, and fervent belief is only a worse substitute for Knowledge. This gives you the power of simplicity. You are the same person in all situations. You are the same person with all other individuals. You will remain strong, discerning and true no matter where you are or what is going on around you.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始看到，信仰只是内识的替代品，而狂热的信仰只是内识更糟糕的替代品。这赋予你简单性的力量。你在任何情况下都是同一个人。你在与所有其他个体相处时也是同一个人。无论你身处何地，无论你周围发生了什么，你都会保持坚强、敏锐和真实。</p>
<p>Here instead of your social conditioning and the weakness of your beliefs, you have the power of Knowledge to guide you and to help you determine who to be with and who not to be with, what to do and what not to do, where to go and where not to go, what to give yourself to and what not to give yourself to.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再依赖你的社会习惯和你信仰的软弱，而是拥有内识的力量来引导你，帮助你决定该和谁在一起以及不该和谁在一起，该做什么以及不该做什么，该去哪里以及不该去哪里，该把你自己交给什么，不该把你自己交给什么。</p>
<p>This is the power of simplicity. Anyone who has this power radiates this power and demonstrates this power and has opened themselves to a greater experience of satisfaction and direction in life.</p>
<p>这就是简单性的力量。任何拥有这种力量的人都会散发出这种力量，展示出这种力量，并让他们自己在生命中获得一种更伟大的满足感和方向感的体验。</p>
<p>Here you still have conflicts in your surface mind. You still feel discomfort and anxieties and have fearful and even destructive thoughts, but now the power and influence of these impulses and thoughts have far less control over you. You see them as mere turbulence at the surface.</p>
<p>在这里，你的表面心灵仍然存在冲突。你仍然会感到不适和焦虑，仍然会有恐惧甚至是破坏性的想法，但现在这些冲动和想法的力量和影响力对你的控制力已经大大减弱了。你将它们视为表面上的动荡。</p>
<p>You are now swimming in the deep ocean beneath the turbulent and ever-changing surface. You are now experiencing the great currents that are carrying the waters of the world in a huge and powerful conveyor, governed by greater cosmic forces.</p>
<p>你现在正游弋在汹涌而不断变化的海面之下的深海中。你现在正体验着伟大的潮流，它们正通过巨大而强大的传送带运送着全世界的水域，而这些传送带由更伟大的宇宙力量所控制。</p>
<p>You are still fallible. You still do foolish things and think foolish thoughts. You still are attracted to meaningless things. You still make mistakes and miscalculations, but your life is stable because it has the ballast of Knowledge. You can weather the storms of the world. You can face great uncertainty without losing yourself. You can let people go no matter how charming and lovely they might be, if they cannot travel with you in the direction that you must follow.</p>
<p>你仍然是会犯错的，你仍然会做傻事，思考愚蠢的想法。你仍然会被无意义的事物所吸引。你仍然会犯错误和计算失误，但你的生命是稳定的，因为它有内识的压舱物。你可以经受住世界的风暴，你可以面对巨大的不确定性而不迷失你自己。你可以放手，无论他们多么迷人和可爱，如果他们不能和你一起走上你必须遵循的方向。</p>
<p>This gives you extraordinary power and ability. You begin to see things other people do not see and know things that other people do not know. And you have the energy and power within yourself to follow through what you see must be done.</p>
<p>这赋予了你非凡的力量和能力。你开始看到他人看不见的事情，知道他人不知道的事情。而你自己的内心也有能量和力量去跟随你看到必须完成的事情。</p>
<p>Here you are not going to give up your greater purpose for love or for money. If love comes to you in serving your purpose, then it has a true place. If wealth comes to you in serving your true purpose, then it has a place. But these now become assets and the means of expression rather than major distractions in and of themselves.</p>
<p>在这里，你不会为了爱或金钱而放弃你更伟大的目的。如果爱是为了服务于你的目的而来到你身边，那么它就有了真实的位置。如果财富是为了服务于你的真实目的而来到你的身边，那么它也有一席之地。但现在，这些都已成为你的资产和表达方式，而非主要的干扰因素本身。</p>
<p>If you can consider these things, you will see the power and the simplicity of Knowledge. It is without confusion and conflict, and that is why it is so unlike your surface mind. It is without deception and condemnation of others. That is why it is different from your surface mind. It is not afraid of the world and of what might happen, and that is how it is different from your surface mind.</p>
<p>如果你能认真思考这些事情，你将看到内识的力量和简单性。它没有困惑和冲突，这就是为什么它与你的表面心灵是如此不同。它没有欺骗，也不会谴责他人。这就是为什么它与你的表面心灵不同。它不惧怕这个世界和可能发生的事情，这就是它与你的表面心灵的不同之处。</p>
<p>Even if you simplified your outer life and made it very efficient and easier to manage, you would still be tormented in yourself if you did not gain access to this greater power within. Your mind would still be a raging mass of conflicting ideas and great anxieties and foolish fantasies.</p>
<p>即使你简化了你的外在生命，让它变得非常高效和易于管理，但如果你不能接触内在的这个更伟大的力量，你内心仍然会饱受折磨。你的心灵仍然会充斥着各种相互冲突的想法、巨大的焦虑和愚蠢的幻想。</p>
<p>Even if you had settled your outer affairs as effectively as possible, if you did not build a deeper connection to Knowledge and learn through time and experience how to follow Knowledge and how to distinguish Knowledge from the other voices and impulses within you, then your life would only be marginally better. You could even go to extremes and become a monastic and have no possessions and no outer distractions of this kind and still really be living in a state of profound confusion and unhappiness.</p>
<p>即使你已经尽可能有效地处理了外在事务，如果你没有与内识建立一种更深层次的联接，也没有通过时间和经验来学习如何跟随内识，以及如何将内识与你内在的其他声音和冲动区分开来，那么你的生命也只是略微好一些。你甚至可以走向极端，成为一名隐士，完全没有任何物质财富，也没有外界的这种干扰，但仍然会生活在一种深刻的困惑和不快乐的状态之中。</p>
<p>The reality here is that very few people in The Way of Knowledge become monastics because people have greater services to perform in the world. For God did not send you into the world only to have you try to get out of the world. That is why the monastic life provides a unique service to the community and the world, but it is only really designed for certain rare individuals.</p>
<p>这里的现实是，在内识之路上，极少有人会成为隐士，因为人们在世界上有更伟大的服务要完成。因为上帝送你来到这个世界上，不只是为了让你试图逃离这个世界。这就是为什么修道生活为社区和世界提供了一种独特的服务，但它实际上只为特定且罕见的个人设计的。</p>
<p>There are many, many other roles to play in the world of great importance, and many of them are very mundane. Someone has to keep the lights on and take the trash out and fix the streets and grow the food and bring it to market. Medicines have to be created, public service has to be rendered, and so the multitude of roles are there to be fulfilled by people who feel called to them and who have a greater purpose in participating within them.</p>
<p>世界上还有许许多多其他非常重要的角色需要扮演，其中许多角色都是非常平凡的。有人必须点亮灯火、清理垃圾、修缮街道、种植粮食并将其运往市场。有人必须研制药品、提供公共服务，因此，这些角色需要由那些感觉到他们被召唤、有一种更伟大的目的参与其中的人们来完成。</p>
<p>Yet do not think that this is a condition of the world at this moment, for very few people are where they really need to be. And that is part of their suffering and confusion. Very few people have found the real purpose that has brought them to the world and are expressing this purpose clearly. If everyone were really where they needed to be, the world would look very different than it does today. You would not even recognize it.</p>
<p>然而，不要认为这就是当今世界的一种状况，因为很少有人处于他们真正需要的位置。这是他们痛苦和困惑的一部分。很少有人找到了将他们带到这个世界的真正目的，并清楚地表达了这个目的。如果每个人都真正处于他们需要的位置，世界将与今天大不相同。你甚至认不出它。</p>
<p>So do not pretend by telling yourself these things. Do not try to think that everything is guided and everything is under Divine control, because the world is chaos. The only thing that is true, powerful and divinely guided within it is Knowledge.</p>
<p>所以不要假装告诉你自己这些事情。不要试图认为一切都是受引导的，一切都在神圣的控制之下，因为世界是混乱的。在这个世界上，唯一真实、强大、受神圣指引的是内识。</p>
<p>This is a world of Separation. It is a world apart where people have taken form and are now distinct individuals who rarely know how to participate with one another very effectively. It is governed by incentives and desires and forces of oppression that are entirely alien to your true nature.</p>
<p>这是一个分离的世界。人们在这里化为了形体，成为了各自独立的个体，很少有人真正知道如何高效参与彼此互动的能力。这个世界被动机、欲望以及完全背离你真实自然的压迫力量所支配。</p>
<p>This is not the world that Knowledge would create. It is because the world is as it is that you have been sent into this place to make a unique and specific contribution. This gives you the greatest opportunity to redeem yourself and to end separation within yourself, to break your allegiance to your ideas, and to break your slavish attachment to your beliefs and to your own separate idea of yourself.</p>
<p>这不是内识会创造的世界。正是因为世界如此，你才被派到这里来做出独特而具体的贡献。这给了你最大的机会来救赎你自己，结束你内在的分离，打破你对你想法的忠诚，打破你对你的信仰和你自己的分离想法的奴性依附。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge can free you in this, and Knowledge frees you by giving you something more important to do, something that brings your life into balance and order and harmony and engages you at a deeper level. You yourself would not know how to redeem your mind, and the attempts you would make in this direction would probably only circumscribe you even further, making it more difficult for you to find your way out.</p>
<p>只有内识能够让你从中解脱，而内识通过赋予你更重要的事情来解放你，让你的生命平衡、有序与和谐，让你在一种更深层次的层面上参与其中。你自己并不知道如何救赎你的心灵，而你在这方面所做的尝试很可能只会进一步限制你，让你更难找到出路。</p>
<p>Here you see you are going from complexity to simplicity, from confusion to certainty, from abstraction to reality. Here you are not trying to use Knowledge as a resource for your mind, but you are giving your mind as a resource for Knowledge.</p>
<p>在这里，你会看到你从复杂性走向简单性，从混乱走向确定，从抽象走向现实。在这里，你不是试图将内识作为你心灵的资源，而是将你的心灵作为内识的资源。</p>
<p>You see, this is what ends the Separation within you. This is what brings your life into a greater focus. But in this greater focus, you do not understand everything. You cannot predict the future. You are not in control. Your mind is controlling your body. You are controlling your affairs. You are exercising restraint, discernment and discretion. But in essence your life is on a greater path that is not of your making, and you are learning to follow this path and choosing this path even when you do not know what will happen next.</p>
<p>你看，正是内识结束了你内在的分离。正是内识让你的生命进入一种更伟大的聚集。但是在这个更伟大的聚集里，你并不理解一切。你无法预测未来。你无法掌控。你的心灵正在控制着你的身体。你正在控制着你的事务。你在练习克制、辨别力和谨慎。但实质上，你的生命正走在一条更伟大的道路上，而这条道路并非由你创造，即使你不知道接下来会发生什么，你也要学会沿着这条道路走下去，并选择这条道路。</p>
<p>Trying to know what will happen next represents insecurity. Sometimes this is necessary to have these premonitions, but usually they represent the core of your insecurity. But with Knowledge, your insecurity begins to fade. It fades into the background. It is still there, but it is weak. It is marginal. It is not the guiding power of your life any more.</p>
<p>试图知道接下来会发生什么代表着不安全感。有时，有这些预感是必要的，但通常它们代表着你不安全感的核心。但有了内识，你的不安全感就会开始消退。它会消失在背景中。它仍然存在，但却很微弱。它是边缘的。它不再是你生命的指导力量。</p>
<p>You can see here that gaining simplicity within yourself is even more important than just readjusting your outer affairs to make them less demanding and more efficient. With Knowledge as your guide, you will create a deep evaluation and sort your life out, and let go of those things that no longer serve you or that never served you in the first place.</p>
<p>在这里，你可以看到，获得内心的简单性甚至比重新调整你的外部事务，使其要求更低、效率更高更为重要。在内识的指导下，你将对你的生命进行一种深度的评估和梳理，放下那些不再为你服务或原本就不曾为你服务的事物。</p>
<p>Knowledge will keep you from giving yourself to people, to places and to things that have no future, that will never be successful, and this alone will preserve you. It will preserve your life force, your energy, your time and your resources to an amazing degree.</p>
<p>内识会阻止你把你自己交给那些没有未来、永远不会成功的人、地方和事物，而只有内识才能保护你。内识会以惊人的程度保护你的生命力、你的能量、你的时间和你的资源。</p>
<p>But you have to be willing to be alone. You cannot have everything you want right now. And you will have to have a growing faith that people will come to you as you really need them and that, particularly at the outset, you must journey alone primarily.</p>
<p>但你必须愿意孤身一人。你不可能现在就拥有你想要的一切。你必须要有一个不断增强的信仰，那就是在你真正需要的时候，人们会来到你的身边，尤其是在开始的时候，你必须主要独自前行。</p>
<p>For relationships should follow purpose. Particularly a marriage or a great partnership should come after you have discerned a real direction in your life. Otherwise, they will tend to compete and replace your focus on this greater direction.</p>
<p>因为关系应该遵循目的。特别是一种婚姻或伟大的伙伴关系，应该在你辨别出你生命的真正方向之后才出现。否则，它们会倾向于竞争并取代你对这个更伟大方向的专注。</p>
<p>This is why you must have great patience and forbearance and great faith in the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself and within other people. True relationship will come to you when you are ready and when your life is ready. You may not know when you are ready or when your life is ready. So you cannot control this; nor should you try.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须拥有伟大的耐心和忍耐，并且对内在以及他人内在的内识的力量和存在保持伟大的信仰。当你做好准备，当你的生命做好准备，真实的关系就会来到你的身边。你可能不知道你什么时候会做好准备，也不知道生命什么时候准备好了。所以你无法控制这一点；你也不应该去尝试。</p>
<p>With Knowledge, your journey in the world becomes very different and your position and reference point become very different. So the world looks different. Your values are different. Your priorities are different. You are looking for greater things now in yourself and in others. And you are managing your outer affairs without complaint.</p>
<p>有了内识，你在世界上的旅程会变得非常不同，你的立场和参照点也会变得非常不同。因此，世界看起来不同了。你的价值观不同了。你的优先事项不同了。现在，你在你自己和他人身上寻找更伟大的内识。你毫无怨言地处理着你的外部事务。</p>
<p>You are rowing the boat, but you really have somewhere to go now. The rowing is still hard. It is still an effort, but you have somewhere to go.</p>
<p>你正在划船，但你现在真的有了目的地。划船仍然很困难，仍然需要付出努力，但你知道你有一个明确的方向要去。</p>
<p>This is simplicity. This is clarity. You are now of one mind. You are not governed and circumscribed by belief and assumption or the dominance of others. You have regained your inner authority, the authority placed there by God. Here you will begin to experience your deeper nature and the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>这就是简单性。这就是清晰性。你现在是一个心灵。你不再被信仰、假设或他人的主导所支配和限制。你重新找回了内在的权威，上帝放置在你内在的权威。在这里，你将开始体验你更深层次的自然和你生命更深层次的潮流。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge within you will know how to navigate the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world. Only Knowledge within you will know who to be with and how to be with them. Only Knowledge within you will indicate if you are ready for a relationship or what you must do about your current employment and circumstances.</p>
<p>只有你内在的内识会知道如何驾驭即将降临世界的变革巨浪。只有你内在的内识会知道该和谁在一起以及如何与他们在一起。只有你内在的内识会表明你是否准备好建立一段关系，或者你必须对你当前的工作和境况做些什么。</p>
<p>Here you must have the patience to wait for Knowledge, to listen for Knowledge, to always listen for Knowledge no matter where you are or what you are doing. Here you gain this connection by taking the Steps to Knowledge and by learning and living The Way of Knowledge, which is a life of strength, purpose, inspiration and simplicity.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须有耐心等待内识，聆听内识，无论你身处何地或在做什么，都要始终聆听内识。在这里，你通过开展内识的进阶，以及学习和实践内识之路，来获得这种连接。内识之路是一种充满力量、目的、灵感和简单性的生命。</p>
<p>This is what you need now. This is what the world needs now, for there are not enough resources in the world to meet everyone’s desires and to accommodate everyone’s aspirations.</p>
<p>这就是你现在所需要的内识。这就是世界现在所需要的内识，因为世界上没有足够的资源来满足每个人的欲望，也无法容纳每个人的追求。</p>
<p>The resources that exist are shrinking now. So the rich will have to live with less, and there will have to be greater assurance for the poor. This can either lead to conflict and endless war or to a greater resolution and with it, a greater possibility to discover and live the inspired life.</p>
<p>现有的资源正在逐渐减少。因此，富人必须生活得更为简朴，而穷人将需要更多的保障。这既可能导致冲突和无休止的战争，也可能导致更伟大的解决方案，进而为发现和过上灵感的生命提供更伟大的可能性。</p>
<p>With Knowledge, you will know what to do, and your recognition will be so powerful, it will be able to overcome your fears, your arguments and whatever dissuasion exists within you. But to find this power and to experience it fully, you must come to Knowledge.</p>
<p>有了内识，你将知道该做什么，你的认知将如此强大，它将能够克服你的恐惧、你的争论以及你内在的任何劝阻。但要找到这种力量并充分体验它，你必须走向内识。</p>
<p>That will simplify your life. That will clarify your mind. That will end endless debate, conflict and confusion regarding what to do and who to be with. For Knowledge has a greater direction, and this is the direction that you are destined to follow.</p>
<p>它将简化你的生命。它将澄清你的心灵。它将结束关于做什么、和谁在一起的无休止的争论、冲突和困惑。因为内识有一个更伟大的方向，而这是你注定要遵循的方向。</p>
