<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger  on October 14, 2008 in Boulder, CO<br>2008年10月14日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humanity is entering difficult times—times of greater uncertainty and upheaval; times where humanity is facing Great Waves of change that are converging on the world: resource depletion, environmental decline, changing climate and violent weather, increasing political and economic instability and the ever-increasing risk of war and conflict between groups and nations over the remaining resources. It is a time that will aggravate longstanding conflicts and resentments between peoples and nations. It will be a time of growing competition and growing uncertainty.</p>
<p>人类正在进入艰难的时期——更加不确定和动荡的时期；在这个时期，人类正面临着汇聚到世界上的变革巨浪：资源枯竭、环境恶化、气候变化和恶劣天气、政治和经济日益不稳定以及群体和国家之间为争夺剩余资源而发生战争和冲突的风险不断增加。这是一个将加剧人们和国家之间长期存在的冲突和怨恨的时期。这将是一个竞争日益激烈、不确定性越来越大的时期。</p>
<p>Humanity has a great choice it will have to make. This choice will have to be made not only on the level of leadership of governments, but also at the level of every citizen. And that choice is whether humanity will fight and compete for the remaining resources or whether there will be a greater uniting and cooperation for the benefit of all. Neither option is easy, of course, but it is a definitive choice.</p>
<p>人类将不得不做出一个伟大的选择。这个选择不仅要在政府的领导层面做出，而且要在每个公民的层面做出。而这个选择就是，人类是要为剩余的资源而战斗和竞争，还是要为所有人的利益而更加团结与合作。当然，两种选择都不容易，但这是一个明确的选择。</p>
<p>It will be a time that will require great restraint and great compassion, not only for one’s own citizens of one’s country, but of other nations as well. It is as if humanity were at a point of choosing the high road or the low road—a path towards unity and cooperation and mutual benefit or a path towards conflict, war and decline.</p>
<p>这将是一个需要极大克制和伟大同情心的时期，不仅对自己国家的公民，而且对其他国家也是如此。就好像人类正处于选择高路或低路的时刻——是走向团结、合作和互利的道路，还是走向冲突、战争和衰退的道路。</p>
<p>The choice really is a choice for the individual as to what voice within themselves they will listen to. Will they listen to the power and presence of Knowledge that God has placed within them to guide them, to protect them and to lead them to a greater life? Or will they listen to the voice of their own personal mind that seeks to protect itself above all things, that will meet its needs first, regardless of the consequences for other peoples? It is a choice as to what voice to follow, what truth to follow.</p>
<p>这个选择实际上是个人的选择，即他们将听从他们自己内心的什么声音。他们是否会听从上帝放置在他们内心深处的内识的力量和存在，以指导他们，保护他们，并引导他们走向更伟大的生命？或者他们会听他们自己的个人心灵的声音，即寻求保护它自己高于一切，首先满足它的需要，而不考虑对其他民族的后果？这是一种选择，既选择追随什么样的声音，追随什么样的真理。</p>
<p>This is not an ideological debate. It is not an intellectual problem. It is more fundamental than this. It is a question of whether you will follow your deeper conscience or your own fear and insecurity. There may be much debate on how cooperation can be established and how it can be established in an equitable manner, and this will require great work, of course. But the choice within the individual is very elemental.</p>
<p>这不是一场意识形态的辩论。它不是一个智力问题。它比这更根本。它是一个你将跟随你更深层次的良知还是你自己的恐惧和不安全感的问题。关于如何建立合作以及如何以公平的方式建立合作，可能会有许多争论，这当然需要做大量的工作。但个人内心的选择是非常根本的。</p>
<p>It is a choice based upon how one sees oneself and the world and how one regards humanity. For there are many people who do not love humanity and would not care if great numbers of people were destroyed, as long as they got what they wanted for themselves.</p>
<p>它是一个基于个人如何看待自己和世界以及如何看待人类的选择。因为有许多人并不爱人类，他们不在乎大量的人被摧毁，只要他们为他们自己得到他们想要的东西。</p>
<p>You are entering a time where great forgiveness must be exercised and where a new understanding of forgiveness must be presented and emphasized and supported. People think often that forgiveness is merely overlooking a problem, or saying a problem is not important, or saying that it really was all for the good, what has happened before. But none of these arguments are really correct or honest.</p>
<p>你们正在进入一个必须行使伟大宽恕的时期，必须提出、强调和支持对宽恕的新理解。人们常常认为，宽恕只是忽略了一个问题，或者说一个问题并不重要，或者说以前发生的一切真的都是为了好。但这些论点都不是真正的正确或诚实的。</p>
<p>Terrible things happen to people. Disappointment is a part of life. Many things do not work out. Many people suffer from events over which they have no control or responsibility. You cannot say this is not important. You cannot say it does not matter. You cannot really say it was all for the good if you are really being honest with yourself and objective concerning the situation.</p>
<p>可怕的事情发生在人们身上。失望是生命的一部分。许多事情都没有成功。许多人遭受到他们无法控制或没有责任的事件。你不能说这并不重要。你不能说这无关紧要。如果你真的对你自己诚实，对情况客观，你就不能真的说这一切都是好事。</p>
<p>Forgiveness really is something else than a kind of pardon that you give to people out of sympathy for them: “Well, I will be noble and pardon you even though I still think you are guilty.” That is not forgiveness. That is a kind of self-validating, self-ennobling process that you do primarily for your own benefit.</p>
<p>宽恕并不是出于对他人的同情而给予的一种赦免：“尽管我仍然认为你有罪，但我会高尚地原谅你”。这不是宽恕。那是一种自我验证、自我崇高的过程，你这样做主要是为了自己的利益。</p>
<p>Forgiveness requires a recognition of another and their humanity. Of course, humanity is fallible, and you can excuse human behavior on this alone, but really it is feeling another person’s condition. Here compassion arises naturally when you recognize the humanity and the reality of another person or a whole nation of people. If you find yourself having a critical or condemning attitude towards a nation of people or a group of people, you should go visit them and talk to them and hear about their experience and understand why their point of view has arisen given their circumstances and their history.</p>
<p>宽恕需要认知另一个人和他们的人性。当然，人性是易变的，你可以仅凭这一点为人类的行为开脱，但实际上它是感受到另一个人的状况。在这里，当你认识到另一个人或整个民族的人性和现实时，同情心就会自然产生。如果你发现你自己对一个民族或一群人有批评或谴责的态度，你应该去拜访他们，与他们交谈，倾听他们的经历，并理解他们的观点是如何在他们的境遇和历史背景下形成的。</p>
<p>It is easy to condemn, but it takes real work to understand. It is easy to dismiss others, label them, reject them, cast them away, or consider them worthy of punishment. That is easy. That is following the voice of condemnation within yourself. But to really understand someone else and their circumstances, that is difficult.</p>
<p>谴责是很容易的，但要理解却需要真正的努力。摒弃他人，给他们贴标签，拒绝他们，把他们赶走，或认为他们值得惩罚，是很容易的。这很容易。那是跟随你自己内心谴责的声音。但是要真正理解另一个人和他们的情况，那就很难了。</p>
<p>Not forgiving your parents is a very good example of this. If you really understood the conditions of their life and their upbringing, you would not be so quick to condemn them or dismiss them or label them or disassociate from them. Understand the circumstances of their life and their history, and you will begin to see that if you were placed under similar circumstances, you would likely respond in much the same manner.</p>
<p>不原谅你的父母就是一个很好的例子。如果你真的理解他们的生活条件和教养方式，你就不会这么快就谴责他们，否定他们，给他们贴上标签，或与他们脱离关系。理解他们的生活环境和历史，你就会开始看到，如果你被置于类似的环境下，你很可能会以同样的方式做出回应。</p>
<p>People condemn because they do not recognize others, and they are too lazy or indolent to find out about others. They want to rest upon their judgments, their attitudes, their beliefs. They want the failure of others or the problem with others to reinforce their attitudes and their beliefs, so their condemnation is a kind of self-validation even though it really is a denial of their true nature.</p>
<p>人们谴责是因为他们不认识对方，而且他们太懒或懒得去了解他人。他们想依靠他们的判断、他们的态度、他们的信仰。他们希望他人的失败或他人的问题能加强他们的态度和信念，所以他们的谴责是一种自我验证，尽管它实际上是对他们真实自然的否定。</p>
<p>So forgiveness has to start with recognizing the humanity of others and exerting the effort to understand why people do what they do, what drives people to do things that are even wicked or tragic. And when you see that you have that same potential within yourself, you become more circumspect, and you are able to withhold condemnation. Truly there are rulers and dictators who are cruel and oppressive and easy to condemn, and you would censure them in the end even if you understood them. But you would be not so quick to go to war against them, for the well-being of their people.</p>
<p>因此，宽恕必须从承认他人的人性开始，并努力理解人们为什么会做这些事，是什么驱使人们去做那些甚至是邪恶或悲惨的事情。当你看到你自己也有这样的潜力时，你就会变得更加谨慎，你就能忍住不谴责。确实有一些统治者和独裁者是残酷的、压迫性的，很容易受到谴责，即使你理解他们，最后你也会谴责他们。但是，为了他们人民的福祉，你不会那么快对他们开战。</p>
<p>In the future, facing Great Waves of change, certain leaders will try to take your nation to war to divert attention. To redirect the population’s dissatisfaction and anger and frustration, certain leaders will try to take the nation to war. They will create a new enemy and emphasize the danger of that enemy. They will try to frighten the people, thinking that this enemy really is out to destroy them and you must fight them; you must unite to fight them.</p>
<p>在未来，面对变革的巨浪，某些领导人会试图把你的国家推向战争，以转移注意力。为了转移民众的不满、愤怒和挫折感，某些领导人会试图把国家推向战争。他们会创造一个新的敌人，并强调这个敌人的危险。他们会试图吓唬人民，认为这个敌人真的要毁灭他们，你们必须与他们战斗；你们必须团结起来与他们战斗。</p>
<p>But with few exceptions, this is a ploy. This is a deception because these leaders want to divert public dissatisfaction away from them and onto someone else and appear to be a strong leader with the people’s welfare at heart. And they will speak to people’s condemnation, resentment and rejection of others. They will exploit the unforgiveness that resides to such a great extent in the minds of people.</p>
<p>但是除了少数例外，这是个计策。这是个骗局，因为这些领导人想把公众的不满从他们身上转移到其他人身上，显得他们是个强大的领导人，把人民的福祉放在心上。而且他们会对人们的谴责、怨恨和对他人的排斥说三道四。他们会利用人们心中的不宽恕，而这种不宽恕在很大程度上是存在的。</p>
<p>This is how so many wars are fomented. Often they are fomented because the leaders of the nation have failed to take care of the needs of their own people, which is their first and primary responsibility as the leaders of a nation. You will see this attempt being made. The temptation for it will be very great. As the leaders of nations find themselves unable or unwilling to fulfill their promises that got them elected, if they were elected, then they will try to take the frustration of the people and direct it onto someone else. This kind of dictatorship always requires an enemy, of course. This is how self-serving people rise to power—by focusing upon an enemy, real or imagined.</p>
<p>许多战争就是这样被煽动起来的。煽动战争往往是因为国家领导人没有照顾到他们自己人民的需要，而这是他们作为国家领导人的首要责任。你会看到这种尝试正在进行。它的诱惑将是非常大的。当国家领导人发现他们自己无法或不愿意履行让他们当选的承诺时，如果他们当选了，那么他们就会试图把人民的挫折感引到其他人身上。当然，这种独裁统治总是需要一个敌人。这就是为自我服务的人上台的方式——专注于一个敌人，无论是真正的还是想象的。</p>
<p>If you really understand people, you want to serve them. You want to help them. You resonate with them. You feel compassion for them. Even if they are led by a cruel and oppressive government, you feel for the condition of the people. You do not want to hurt them. The degree to which this recognition and compassion exists is the degree to which the balance is tipped towards peace and cooperation. For there is always the threat of war because competition is part of nature, and competition between human beings can easily lead to conflict, particularly at times of economic difficulty.</p>
<p>如果你真的理解人们，你就想为他们服务。你想帮助他们。你与他们产生共鸣。你会对他们产生同情心。即使他们被一个残酷的、压迫性的政府所领导，你也对人民的状况感同身受。你不想伤害他们。这种认知和同情心存在的程度，就是天平向和平与合作倾斜的程度。因为战争的威胁总是存在的，因为竞争是自然的一部分，人类之间的竞争很容易导致冲突，特别是在经济困难的时候。</p>
<p>So the first step in forgiveness is recognizing the humanity of another, to learn why they feel the way they do. And if you have the opportunity to learn about their personal life, that is helpful. Even to learn what whole nations of people have been through gives you pause and a deeper regard for them.</p>
<p>因此，宽恕的第一步是承认他人的人性，了解他们为什么有这样的感受。如果你有机会了解他们的个人生活，那就很有帮助。甚至了解整个国家的人民所经历的事情，也会让你停下来，对他们有更深入的关注。</p>
<p>If the peoples of another nation do not like the policies of your nation, find out why that is. Perhaps they have good cause to be critical or to be suspicious. This takes real courage and humility, you see. You cannot be someone who simply wants to reinforce their prejudices by capitalizing on the failure or the opposition of others.</p>
<p>如果另一个国家的人民不喜欢你的国家的政策，找出原因。也许他们有充分的理由进行批评或怀疑。你看，这需要真正的勇气和谦逊。你不能成为一个仅仅想通过利用他人的失败或反对来加强你自己偏见的人。</p>
<p>If you don’t recognize another, you can condemn them, and you will certainly not feel a connection to them, and your innate connection to the human family will be broken. Now you only want to support your group – your religious group, your racial group, your national group, your economic group. And your natural affinity for humanity will be lost. This is the great danger for humanity now in facing the Great Waves of change, for the Great Waves of change call for a united human response, but they also engender humanity’s age old problem of tribal identity and hostility towards others.</p>
<p>如果你不承认另一个人，你可以谴责他们，你肯定不会感觉到你与他们的联接，你与人类大家庭的内在联接将被打破。现在你只想支持你的群体——你的宗教群体、你的种族群体、你的国家群体、你的经济群体。而你对人类的自然亲和力将会丧失。这是人类现在面对变革巨浪时的巨大危险，因为变革巨浪要求人类团结一致地应对，但它们也会产生人类古老的部落认同和对他人的敌意问题。</p>
<p>There is a great fork in the road. Everyone will have to choose. It is not just a matter for governments and policy there. It is for everyone. You elect a candidate who is either going to take you to war or to seek a greater cooperation with others. This is part of the criteria that you should consider in electing a leader of your nation.</p>
<p>在这条路上有一个伟大的岔路。每个人都将不得不做出选择。这不仅仅是政府和政策的问题。它对每个人都是如此。你选出一个候选人，他要么把你带入战争，要么寻求与他人更多的合作。这是你们在选举国家领导人时应该考虑的部分标准。</p>
<p>Forgiveness also rests upon what you value within yourself. If you identify only with your ideas, beliefs and prejudices, well, then you will try to use everything to reinforce that. And you will want to have opposition and enemies because they seem to make your position more tenable, more realistic and more righteous. That is why when people identify with their minds, it sets them in opposition to others who have different thoughts, different attitudes and different positions.</p>
<p>宽恕也取决于你自己内心的价值。如果你只认同你的想法、信仰和偏见，那么，你会试图利用一切来加强这种认同。你会希望有反对派和敌人，因为他们似乎使你的立场更站得住脚，更现实，更正义。这就是为什么当人们认同他们的心灵时，会使他们与那些有不同思想、不同态度和不同立场的人对立。</p>
<p>Yet if you recognize that who you are is greater than your mind, that you have a deeper conscience within yourself beyond what your cultures, families and religions have tried to inculcate in you, then that opens you to a deeper recognition of the nature and the reality of people—people of different nations, different cultures, different religions, people of different racial background. You will feel a kind of natural resonance with people. Now you are not cataloging them according to how they fit in with your system of belief. That is the prison of the mind.</p>
<p>然而，如果你认识到你是谁比你的心灵更伟大，你在你自己的内心深处有一种更深层次的良知，超越了你的文化、家庭和宗教试图灌输给你的想法，那么这将使你对人们的自然和现实有一种更深层次的认知——不同国家、不同文化、不同宗教、不同种族背景的人们。你会感到与人们有一种自然的共鸣。现在你不是根据他们如何符合你的信仰体系来对他们进行分类。那是心灵的监狱。</p>
<p>Instead, you look at people as people. You understand people as people. You recognize that most people are really trying to do the right thing and trying to live a genuine life—hindered by their circumstances, perhaps hindered by their governments, hindered perhaps by their religious or cultural conditioning. But they are really trying to do the best thing. So you give people the benefit of the doubt instead of just condemning them outright.</p>
<p>相反，你把人们当作人来看。你把人当作人去理解。你认识到大多数人真的在努力做正确的事情，努力过一种真正的生命——受到他们环境的阻碍，也许受到他们政府的阻碍，也许受到他们宗教或文化条件的阻碍。但他们真的在努力做最好的事情。因此，你选择给人们以怀疑的余地，而不是轻易地直接谴责他们。</p>
<p>It is what you identify with in yourself. If you think you are your mind, then you will think your ideas are so very important and that they define who you are and what you are. Then you will either accept or reject people based upon whether they can agree with your fixed ideas. This is how people can become so heartless with one another. This is where cruelty can emerge, particularly under difficult circumstances. This is where one group wants to destroy another group, having convinced themselves the other group is bad or a danger to their existence. Even if you were forced under circumstances to fight with another group of people, you could still do this without denying their humanity. That is the difference between armed conflict and outright genocide.</p>
<p>这是你在你自己身上认同的心灵。如果你认为你是你的心灵，那么你就会认为你的想法是非常重要的，它们定义了你是谁，你是什么。然后你会根据人们是否能同意你的固定想法来接受或拒绝他们。这就是人与人之间如何变得如此无情的原因。这就是残忍会出现的地方，特别是在困难的情况下。这就是一个群体想要摧毁另一个群体的地方，因为他们相信另一个群体是坏的，或者对他们的生存构成了危险。即使你在这些环境下被迫与另一个群体作战，你仍然可以这样做，而不否认他们的人性。这就是武装冲突和彻底的种族灭绝之间的区别。</p>
<p>Then there is the conditions of people. If people do not have enough land to grow food, if they do not have enough to eat, if they are under that kind of continual pressure, of course they are going to lash out at others. They are driven to madness. They are driven to deprivation. You cannot condemn them if they are driven to this by their very circumstances. If young people cannot find work, if there are no opportunities, do you think they will not try to turn to something more extreme in order to gain a sense of security and value within their cultures?</p>
<p>然后是人们的条件。如果人们没有足够的土地来种植食物，如果他们没有足够的食物，如果他们处于这种持续的压力之下，他们当然会向他人发泄。他们被逼到了疯狂的地步。他们被驱使到剥夺的境地。如果他们是被他们的环境所驱使，你无法谴责他们。如果年轻人找不到工作，如果没有机会，你认为他们不会试图转向更极端的事情，以便在他们的文化中获得安全感和价值吗？</p>
<p>The wise person sees the plight and the conditions of others, not only the plight of their circumstances, but the fact that their inner life has never been able to be cultivated. They are driven by constant pressure, constant ideological conditioning, constant struggle for survival, constant hardship. You cannot expect people to have a more subtle and deeper nature or awareness of themselves under these conditions.</p>
<p>明智的人看到了他人的困境和条件，不仅是他们环境的困境，而且是他们的内在生命从未能够得到培养的事实。他们被不断的压力、不断的意识形态调节、不断的生存斗争、不断的困苦所驱使。你不能指望人们在这种条件下对他们自己有更微妙和更深层次的自然或觉知。</p>
<p>Perhaps the individual was meant to be a great scientist or a physician or a valuable educator, but now they are driven out of desperation to scratch out a living from the earth. You cannot expect equanimity from a person in this position. You yourself would be extremely aggravated, driven to extreme views and condemnation of others were you placed in such circumstances with no opportunity or possibility for relief.</p>
<p>也许这个人本来是要成为一位伟大的科学家或医生或有价值的教育家，但现在他们是出于绝望的驱使，要从地球上抓出一条活路。你不能指望一个人在这种情况下能保持平静。如果你被置于这样的环境中，没有机会或可能得到解脱，你自己也会感到非常委屈，被驱使到极端的观点和对他人的谴责。</p>
<p>If you see that your deeper nature is beyond your mind, then you will not become so identified with your ideas, your beliefs or your prejudices, and you will be much more reserved in judging, condemning or dismissing others. This kind of self-awareness is so very important because when people are denied recognition of their deeper nature, their thinking becomes aberrant. They identify with their thoughts and their possessions, and their ability to recognize others and to experience compassion is limited or destroyed altogether.</p>
<p>如果你看到你更深层次的自然超越了你的心灵，那么你就不会变得如此认同你的想法、你的信仰或你的偏见，你在判断、谴责或否定他人时就会更有保留。这种自我觉知是非常重要的，因为当人们被剥夺了对其更深层次自然的认知时，他们的思维就会变得反常。他们认同他们的思想和财产，他们认识他人和体验同情心的能力受到限制或完全被破坏。</p>
<p>The third aspect of forgiveness is recognizing that you have come here for a greater purpose and that God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you to guide you, to protect you and to enable you to experience this purpose, and to express it in service to the world and to humanity. Only a very few people in the world have the opportunity to cultivate this deeply because their circumstances are giving them the freedom and the opportunity to entertain and to focus upon their greater nature. That is why it is such a tragedy when wealthier people squander and forfeit this fundamental opportunity, to seek pleasure and fantasy, self-obsession and addiction.</p>
<p>宽恕的第三个方面是认识到你是为了一个更伟大的目的来到这里的，上帝在你内心深处放置了一个更深层次的内识来引导你，保护你，使你能够经历这个目的，并在为世界和人类服务中表达出来。世界上只有极少数人有机会深入培养这一点，因为他们的环境给了他们自由和机会来娱乐和关注他们更伟大的自然。这就是为什么当较富裕的人挥霍和放弃这个基础的机会，去寻求快乐和幻想，自我迷恋和沉迷时，它是一个悲剧。</p>
<p>From the standpoint of having a higher purpose, you realize that everyone is teaching you the value of Knowledge. Both their successes and their failures are showing you the importance of adhering to this deeper Knowledge within yourself. Why would you condemn others when they are teaching you the results of not following Knowledge within yourself? When people are making every kind of error and experiencing the consequences of these errors, why would you condemn them when they are showing you the results of your own temptation to deny the power, presence and guidance of Knowledge within yourself?</p>
<p>从有更高宗旨的角度来看，你意识到每个人都在教你内识的价值。他们的成功和失败都在向你展示坚持你自己内心这种更深层次内识的重要性。当他们在教你不遵循你自己内心的内识的结果时，你为什么要谴责他们呢？当人们正在犯各种错误并经历这些错误的后果时，当他们向你展示你自己否认你内在内识的力量、存在和指导的诱惑的结果时，你为什么要谴责他们？</p>
<p>Already you know things that you are not doing. You may say to yourself, “Oh, I must give this up. Oh, I must change this,” or “I must stop eating this food,” or “I must stop going to this place,” but you do not change. So you look at others, and they show you the result of this unwillingness to change. And instead of condemning them for your own failure in this regard, you see that they are giving you a sign. They are teaching you something. Perhaps their situation is tragic as a result of this, but they are really showing you something. They are showing you the results of living life without Knowledge, without this greater guidance that God has given you, a life that is not guided by the deeper conscience within them.</p>
<p>你已经知道你没有做的事情。你可能对你自己说：“哦，我必须放弃这个。哦，我必须改变这个，”或者“我必须停止吃这种食物，”或者“我必须停止去这个地方，”但是你没有改变。所以你看着其他人，他们向你展示了这种不愿意改变的结果。而不是因为你自己在这方面的失败而谴责他们，你看到他们正在给你一个迹象。他们在教你一些事情。也许他们的处境因此而变得悲惨，但他们真的在向你展示一些事情。他们在向你展示生活中没有内识生命的结果，没有上帝赋予你的这种更伟大的指导，一种没有被他们内心深处的更深层次的良知所指导的生命。</p>
<p>This will temper your condemnation. This will give pause to your rejection of others. You will see that life is serving you in this way, from this vantage point. You will see this. Every excuse you can think of not to do what you know you must do, you can look at others and see the result of following that decision.</p>
<p>这将缓和你的谴责。这将使你对他人的拒绝有所停顿。你会看到，生命正以这种方式，从这个有利的角度为你服务。你将看到这一点。你能想到的每一个不做你知道你必须做的事的借口，你都可以看看其他人，看到遵循这一决定的结果。</p>
<p>You can see the result of giving yourself over to the pursuit of pleasure, to the pursuit of happiness, to the denial of personal responsibilities. You see this in other people’s decisions, in their behavior and in the outcomes of their lives. Somehow they have betrayed their deeper nature and their deeper purpose, clamoring for some advantage, trying to live out their ideas, their beliefs and their desires.</p>
<p>你可以看到把你自己交给追求快乐、追求幸福、否认个人责任的结果。你在其他人的决定、他们的行为和他们的生命结果中看到这一点。不知何故，他们背叛了他们更深层次的自然和更深层次的目的，吵着要得到一些好处，试图活出他们的想法、信仰和欲望。</p>
<p>This is shocking and gives you pause to reconsider your own life, for it is the failure of others that will convince you in the end that you must be true to yourself. From this vantage point and higher perspective, you see that the world in its entirety is a demonstration of both the success and the failure to follow Knowledge within people and the immense difference in the consequences of life that these two very different approaches produce.</p>
<p>这让人震惊，让你停下来重新考虑你自己的生命，因为正是他人的失败最终会让你相信，你必须忠于你自己。从这个有利的角度和更高的视角，你会发现整个世界都在展示人们内心追随内识的成功与失败，以及这两种截然不同的方法所产生的生命后果的巨大差异。</p>
<p>If you deny Knowledge within yourself and try to live according to your ideas, your beliefs or the persuasions of others, you will be a kind of slave to these forces. Your life will be slavish, and your mind will be slavish, and you will hate others who are slavish because they remind you of your own degraded condition.</p>
<p>如果你否认你自己内心的内识，试图按照你的想法、你的信仰或他人的说服来生活，你将成为这些力量的一种奴隶。你的生命将是奴性的，你的心灵将是奴性的，你将憎恨那些奴性的人，因为他们提醒你自己的堕落状况。</p>
<p>You will be easily led by clever and manipulating leaders to believe what they want you to believe, to go to war when they want you to go to war, to purchase what they want you to purchase because you have lost your own compass within yourself. Your own deeper discernment of what is right and wrong has been so clouded now that it seems to be a mystery when in fact it is the most fundamental reality within yourself.</p>
<p>你会很容易被聪明和操纵的领导人引导，相信他们想要你相信的，在他们想要你去打仗的时候去打仗，购买他们想要你购买的东西，因为你已经失去了你自己内心的指南针。你自己对什么是正确和错误的更深层次的辨别力现在已经被蒙蔽了，以至于它似乎是一个谜，而事实上它是你内心最基本的现实。</p>
<p>When you see that other people are serving you by their demonstration, by reminding you of the importance to be true to yourself, to be honest with yourself, to be objective about life, how can you condemn them? You may be upset by their behavior. You might be moved by their tragedy. They might even be dangerous people, and you will have to guard yourself against them or be wary around them, but really they are also giving you something very important. If everyone all around you is making every kind of mistake and showing you the results of your own temptations, how can you condemn them?</p>
<p>当你看到其他人通过他们的示范为你服务，通过提醒你忠于你自己、对你自己诚实、对生命客观的重要性，你怎么能谴责他们？你可能会对他们的行为感到不安。你可能会被他们的悲剧所推动。他们甚至可能是危险的人，你将不得不防备他们或在他们周围保持警惕，但实际上他们也在给你一些非常重要的礼物。如果你周围的每个人都在犯各种错误，向你展示你自己诱惑的结果，你怎么能谴责他们？</p>
<p>Surely, they inadvertently, unintentionally, are really trying to save your life. If you look at their lives and you say, “I will not do that. I cannot live like that. I will not succumb to those pressures or those temptations,” then they are strengthening you. Thank them and move on. For without Knowledge, people can only commit error. They will create lives that do not reflect their deeper nature or their true intentions. They will create lives of degrading compromise, lives of self-oppression or oppression by others. They will be led along by their cultural values and the admonitions of their leaders. They will be easily seduced. They will be easily betrayed.</p>
<p>当然，他们不经意地，无意地，真的在努力拯救你的生命。如果你看着他们的生命，你说：“我不会那样做。我不能像那样生活。我不会屈服于那些压力或那些诱惑，”那么他们正在强化你。感谢他们并继续前进。因为没有内识，人们只能犯错误。他们将创造不反映其更深层次自然或真实意图的生命。他们会创造出有辱人格的妥协的生命，自我压迫或被他人压迫的生命。他们会被他们的文化价值观和领导人的告诫牵着鼻子走。他们会很容易被引诱。他们将很容易被背叛。</p>
<p>From a higher vantage point, from the perspective of recognizing that you have a higher purpose in life, you will see these things. Perhaps you could not see them before, but you will see them clearly now. You will see that life is teaching you that there is only Knowledge or the substitutes for Knowledge. There is only being true to your deeper nature, or there is betrayal in all directions.</p>
<p>从一个更高的观测位置，从认识到你有更高宗旨的生命的角度，你会看到这些事情。也许你以前看不到它们，但你现在会清楚地看到它们。你会看到，生命正在教导你，只有内识或内识的替代品。只有忠于你更深层次的自然，否则就会遭到全方位的背叛。</p>
<p>People betray themselves for happiness, to pursue happiness. They betray themselves to pursue pleasures that are unhealthy for them. They betray themselves to give over to attractions and seductions. They betray themselves when they follow mindlessly the dictates of their culture, their nation or their religions. They betray themselves when they condemn others and other peoples, and when they assume, adopt and emphasize the prejudices of their group or their culture. The level of self-betrayal is just immense and incredible. Some of it people recognize. But most of it they think is just life itself, that is the normal life, the normal state of mind, the normal state of affairs when in fact it is a gross and compounded state of self-betrayal.</p>
<p>人们为了幸福，为了追求幸福而背叛他们自己。他们背叛他们自己去追求对他们不健康的快乐。他们背叛他们自己，屈服于吸引力和诱惑。当他们无意识地听从他们的文化、民族或宗教的指令时，他们就背叛了他们自己。当他们谴责他人和其他民族时，当他们假设、采用和强调他们的群体或文化的偏见时，他们就背叛了他们自己。自我背叛的程度是巨大的，令人难以置信。其中有些是人们认识到的。但其中大部分他们认为只是生命本身，是正常的生命，正常的心境，正常的事态，而实际上这是一种严重的、复合的自我背叛状态。</p>
<p>Here the student of Knowledge must backtrack. They must undo what they have created that is not right for them. This is part of their redemption. They must untie the knots and loosen the chains that hold them down. They do this with commitment and determination, not with self-hatred and condemnation of others.</p>
<p>在这里，内识的学生必须回溯。他们必须撤消他们所创造的不适合他们的事物。这是他们救赎的一部分。他们必须解开绳结，松开束缚他们的枷锁。他们是带着承诺和决心来做这件事的，而不是带着自我憎恨和对他人的谴责。</p>
<p>So there are three aspects here to make forgiveness a reality and not merely a wish, a hope, or some kind of self-edifying activity. You do not want to pardon people. That is arrogant, and that does not recognize the fundamental error of condemnation. You recognize the humanity of others. You recognize their circumstances and the conditions of their lives and the pressures that are being brought to bear upon them. And you never lose sight of their humanity. Even if you are forced to oppose them under dire circumstances, you never lose sight of their humanity. And, therefore, there will not be cruelty in your approach.</p>
<p>所以这里有三个方面，使宽恕成为现实，而不仅仅是一个愿望，一个希望，或某种自我陶醉的活动。你不想要赦免人们。那是傲慢的，不承认谴责的根本错误。你承认他人的人性。你认识到他们的环境和他们的生活条件，以及给他们带来的压力。而且你从未忽视他们的人性。即使你被迫在恶劣的环境下反对他们，你也从未忽视他们的人性。因此，你的做法不会有残酷性。</p>
<p>The second, again, is you come to understand their circumstances and the conditions of their life, which you can do by giving some attention to this, by trying to understand someone before you condemn or dismiss them. This will lead to a more just and effective response to them. You value building cooperation wherever you can. Some places you cannot build cooperation with others, but that is your emphasis because that is the great human need in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>第二，同样，你开始理解他们的处境和生活条件，你可以通过给予一些关注来做到这一点，在你谴责或否定一个人之前试图理解他。这将导致对他们做出更公正和有效的回应。你重视在你能做到的地方建立合作。有些地方你无法与他人建立合作，但这是你的重点，因为这是人类在面对变革的巨浪时的伟大需求。</p>
<p>The highest vantage point here is recognizing that you were born for a greater purpose and that there is a deeper Knowledge within you, a deeper current of your life that holds this purpose; and that this deeper part of you is wise and compassionate but strong and determined; and that you look at others as a demonstration of whether they are adhering to this Knowledge or not. This reinforces your commitment to be true and honest with yourself. And you begin to realize that life is giving you a gift by showing you the results, dramatically, of what denying Knowledge within you would create for you and for others.</p>
<p>这里的最高观测点是认识到你是为一个更伟大的目的而出生的，在你内心有一个更深层次的内识，你的生命中有一股更深层次的水流，持有这个目的；你的这个更深层次的部分是明智的、有同情心的，但也是强大的、坚定的；你把他人看成是他们是否坚持这个内识的证明。这加强了你对你自己真实和诚实的承诺。你开始意识到，生命正在给你一份礼物，向你展示了拒绝你内心的内识将为你和他人创造的结果，非常引人注目。</p>
<p>This changes your view of everything, but it is very realistic. It does not mean that you accept everything, that you love everything, that everything is wonderful because everything is not wonderful. Everyone is not doing okay. So this recognition is based upon a reality, not only the physical reality but a deeper reality within yourself.</p>
<p>这改变了你对一切的看法，但它是非常现实的。这并不意味着你接受一切，你爱一切，一切都很美好，因为一切都不美好。每个人都不是做得很好。所以这种承认是基于一种现实，不仅是物质的现实，而是你自己内心一种更深层次的现实。</p>
<p>Here you recognize that who you are is not your mind, your ideas, your beliefs. All that is part of your conditioning and perhaps is an exertion of your personal mind to be distinct or important. But really there is a deeper nature, too, and you feel its presence. And you always recognize it even if it remains incomprehensible.</p>
<p>在这里，你认识到你是谁并不是你的心灵、你的想法、你的信仰。所有这些都是你的条件的一部分，也许是你个人心灵的努力，以使你与众不同或重要。但实际上，也有一种更深层次的自然，你感觉到它的存在。而且你总是认识到它，即使它仍然是不可理解的。</p>
<p>Here you see that things are not what they seem, that people have a deeper nature within themselves, and if that nature is being denied, people will not behave very well. They will not live very well. They will not be healthy. They will not be in right standing with themselves or with other people. That natural harmony will be denied.</p>
<p>在这里，你看到事情并不像他们所看到的那样，人们在他们自己的内在有一种更深层次的自然，如果这个自然被否认，人们将不会表现得很好。他们不会生活得很好。他们不会健康。他们不会与他们自己或与其他人有正确的关系。这种自然的和谐将被剥夺。</p>
<p>You can see here that, really, forgiveness requires work on your part and a real shift within yourself because you cannot just make excuses for other people without this deeper recognition. Otherwise, forgiveness has not occurred. You have not taken something that is harmful and used it for something valuable.</p>
<p>在这里你可以看到，实际上，宽恕需要你的努力和你内心的真正转变，因为你不能在没有更深层次的认知的情况下为他人找借口。否则，宽恕就没有发生。你没有把一些有害的事情，用于有价值的内识。</p>
<p>Here you must understand that not everything that happens is beneficial. And you know this to be true. But everything that happens can be used for a greater purpose without denying the reality of what has happened. Here you are not denying something that is harmful by calling it good, but you are trying to look for a benefit of the sign it is giving you so that it can strengthen your resolution to bring greater honesty and compassion into your life.</p>
<p>在这里你必须理解，不是所有发生的事情都是有益的。你也知道这是真实的。但是，所有发生的事情都可以被用于一个更伟大的目的，而不否认已经发生的现实。在这里，你并不是通过称其为好事来否认有害的事情，而是试图从它给你的暗示中寻找益处，从而加强你的决心，将更伟大的诚实和同情心带入你的生命中。</p>
<p>If you try to make everything wonderful and beneficial, you will be dishonest, and dishonesty leads to great errors and great difficulties. And so your evaluation must be based upon a deeper awareness within yourself that is not really ideological in nature. It is more of a natural resonance. It is beyond the intellect. It is the empathy you feel with people at a deeper level. When you are able to meet someone and make a connection with them and recognize their situation, you will have a greater regard for them than you would by simply judging them from afar.</p>
<p>如果你试图让一切都变得美好和有益，你将是不诚实的，而不诚实会导致巨大的错误和巨大的困难。因此，你的评价必须基于你内心的一种更深层次的觉知，这种觉知在自然上并不是真正的意识形态。它更像是一种自然的共鸣。它是超越智力的。它是你在更深层次的层面上对人们的共鸣。当你能够见到某人，并与他们建立联系，认识到他们的处境，你会比单纯地从远处判断他们更重视他们。</p>
<p>Everyone will be facing the Great Waves of change. It will produce great hardship. The Great Waves of change are largely the product of humanity’s abuse and overuse of the world. Now the consequences of all that are beginning to manifest in many different ways at once.</p>
<p>每个人都将面对变革的巨浪。它将产生巨大的困苦。变革的巨浪在很大程度上是人类对世界的滥用和过度使用的产物。现在，这一切的后果开始以许多不同的方式同时显现出来。</p>
<p>If humanity discovers that its resources are limited, it will have to change its economic systems, its approach to living, its interactions with the world, its use of resources—everything. These changes are very difficult for people. However necessary they might be, it will produce great stress and even deprivation for people.</p>
<p>如果人类发现其资源是有限的，它将不得不改变其经济体系、生活方式、与世界的互动、对资源的使用——一切。这些变化对人们来说是非常困难的。无论它们多么必要，它都会给人们产生巨大的压力，甚至是剥夺。</p>
<p>You may want change, but you have to realize that change is very difficult, and many people do not undergo change very gracefully or very willingly, so it engenders conflict. People who are advocates for change often overlook the cost of change, the price of change, the impacts of change. They want the world to be different than it is, but they don’t really understand what it will take to get from here to there, from where the world is today to where the world could be in a better state.</p>
<p>你可能想要改变，但你必须意识到，改变是非常困难的，许多人不会非常优雅地或非常愿意地接受改变，所以它产生了冲突。倡导改变的人往往忽略了改变的成本、改变的代价和改变的影响。他们希望世界与现在不同，但他们并不真正理解从这里到那里，从今天的世界到世界可能达到的更好的状态，需要付出什么。</p>
<p>Even in your own life, you do not undergo change very gracefully, or very willingly. Real change that is required is very challenging. You resist it, and you struggle with it, and you complain about it even if it is absolutely essential for you. Change requires work, determination, self-confidence, taking risks, giving up security. Nobody does this very easily.</p>
<p>即使在你自己的生命中，你也不会非常从容地接受改变，或非常愿意地接受改变。真正需要的改变是非常具有挑战性的。你抵制它，你与它斗争，你抱怨它，即使它对你来说是绝对必要的。改变需要工作、决心、自信、承担风险、放弃安全。没有人很容易做到这一点。</p>
<p>Therefore, never forget the humanity of people. Look beyond your own mind for the reality of your deeper nature. Do not be so controlled by your beliefs and thoughts and the conditioning of your cultures. And recognize you have come into the world for a greater purpose and that God has given you Knowledge to enable you to find this purpose, to discern it, to experience it and to express it in the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>因此，永远不要忘记人们的人性。超越你自己的心灵，去发现你更深层次自然的现实。不要被你的信仰和思想以及你的文化的条件所控制。并认识到你是为了一个更伟大的目的来到这个世界上，上帝给了你内识，使你能够找到这个目的，辨别它，体验它，并在生命不断变化的环境中表达它。</p>
<p>Then forgiveness will be something that will arise naturally, rather than being an artificial exercise. This will enable you to see through deception and confusion and to honor the deeper nature of peoples. If humanity is to progress and survive the Great Waves of change, this deeper honesty and recognition must be fostered in ever greater numbers of people. And if you are able to do this and see its importance, you will naturally share this with others and be an agent of positive change in the world.</p>
<p>这样，宽恕就会自然而然地产生，而不是人为的练习。这将使你能够看穿欺骗和混乱，并尊重人们更深层次的自然。如果人类要进步并在变革的巨浪中生存下来，这种更深层次的诚实和认知必须在越来越多的人中培养起来。如果你能做到这一点并看到其重要性，你自然会与他人分享，并成为世界上积极改变的代理人。</p>
