<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on August 19, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年8月19日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people are concerned about the future. As times become more turbulent and discordant, more and more people will be feeling anxiety about what may happen next. Their anxiety will increase in time, for in facing the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, events will accelerate and economies will become more turbulent and unstable. There will be greater environmental problems, and people everywhere will have to face the reality of resource depletion in the world.</p>
<p>许多人都在关注未来。随着时代变得更加动荡和不和谐，越来越多的人将对接下来会发生的事情感到焦虑。他们的焦虑将随着时间的推移而增加，因为在面对即将降临世界的变革巨浪时，各种事件会加速发生，经济将变得更加动荡和不稳定。将会出现更严重的环境问题，世界各地的人们将不得不面对世界资源枯竭的现实。</p>
<p>How will you know what to do in the face of great change? Where will you turn? Who will you consult with? Who do you think will lead you into the difficult and uncertain times ahead?</p>
<p>面对伟大的变革，你如何知道该做什么？你将向哪里寻求帮助？你将与谁咨询？你认为谁会引领你走过未来困难而不确定的时期？</p>
<p>The human family has many great strengths, but one of its weaknesses is it has not planned for the future adequately. People do not look ahead. They do not look and see what is coming over the horizon. And so they find themselves unprepared and overwhelmed by events in life, which could, in most cases, have been foreseen. They had their backs to the future, and the future arrived.</p>
<p>人类大家庭拥有许多伟大的优势，但其弱点之一是没有对未来进行充分规划。人们没有向前看。他们没有看到地平线上即将到来的变革巨浪。因此，他们发现他们自己毫无准备，被生命中的事件所淹没，而在大多数情况下，这些事件是可以预见的。他们背对着未来，而未来已经到来。</p>
<p>All of a sudden they find themselves underwater or overwhelmed—without work, even without a home. And yet you must ask: “Why did they not see this coming? The signs were there.” There are always signs before great events. Sometimes signs occur years before great events. But there are very few people who can recognize these signs and respond appropriately before the event arrives.</p>
<p>突然之间，他们发现他们自己被水淹没或不堪重负——没有工作，甚至没有家。然而你一定会问：“为什么他们没有预见到这一点？迹象就在那里”。在大事件发生之前总会有迹象。有时，迹象会在大事件发生的前几年出现。但是，很少有人能在事件发生之前识别这些迹象并做出适当的反应。</p>
<p>People are consumed in the moment and always reflecting to the past. Their thoughts about the future are mostly hopes and fears. People are not trained as children to look into the future with objectivity and to reflect using a deeper Intelligence that God has placed within each person, an Intelligence called Knowledge.</p>
<p>人们沉浸在当下，总是回想过去。他们对未来的想法大多是希望和恐惧。人们从小就没有接受过客观地展望未来，也没有使用上帝放置在每个人内心深处的更深层次的智能来反思，这种智能被称为内识。</p>
<p>This failure to look ahead and to live life upon self-assuring assumptions represents one of humanity’s real weaknesses at this point—a weakness that will lay them vulnerable to immense difficulty, both now and in the future.</p>
<p>这种缺乏前瞻性，以及生活在自我安慰假设基础上的生命，代表了人类目前真正的弱点之一——这种弱点将使人类现在和将来都容易遭受极大的困难。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you will give you signs and will respond to signs in the world that are significant. For a sign is not merely a message; it is also a teaching. A sign is there not only to warn you, but also to instruct you. Most of the instruction will come from Knowledge within yourself, but sometimes signs actually tell you what to do.</p>
<p>你内在的内识会给你迹象，并会对世界上重要的迹象做出回应。因为迹象不仅仅是一条讯息；它也是一种教导。迹象不仅是为了警告你，也是为了指导你。大多数指导都来自你内在的内识，但有时迹象实际上会告诉你该做什么。</p>
<p>In a very obvious sense, if there is smoke in the building, you know there is a fire. That is a sign, so you respond. But most of the signs that deal with future events are very subtle. They are subtle, but they are also frequent. If you are paying attention, you can see them. And Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, will advise you what to do, will urge you to do certain things and not others.</p>
<p>从一个非常明显的意义上来说，如果大楼里有烟，你就知道发生了火灾。这是一个迹象，所以你会做出反应。但大多数与未来事件有关的迹象都非常微妙。它们很微妙，但也很常见。如果你留心观察，你就能看到它们。而内识，你内在更深层次的智能，会告诉你该怎么做，会敦促你做某些事情，而不是其他事情。</p>
<p>Every day people are committing themselves to various things, many of which will not work. But because they are not reviewing their decisions with Knowledge, they go ahead upon the urging of others—upon the urging of their family or friends, or urged by their own fear of loneliness, or their own desire for wealth.</p>
<p>人们每天都在承诺各种各样的事情，其中许多都是行不通的。但是，由于他们没有用内识来审视他们的决定，他们只是在他人的催促下继续前行——在家人或朋友的催促下，或是因为他们自己对孤独的恐惧，或者他们自己对财富的渴望。</p>
<p>Every disastrous decision began as a good idea, and people were prompted by some desire or need. But disasters occur because people are not responding to Knowledge and are not referring to Knowledge when they are making important decisions.</p>
<p>每一个灾难性的决定最初都是一个好主意，人们受到某种欲望或需求的驱使。但灾难之所以发生，是因为人们在做出重要决定时没有对内识做出回应，也没有参考内识。</p>
<p>You can fool the intellect. It is not difficult to do that. But to fool Knowledge is very difficult. The only way people can be fooled here is that they are not sufficiently aware of Knowledge. They do not use Knowledge. They do not consult with Knowledge. They do not reflect with Knowledge. And so their intellects are easily seduced, easily persuaded, easily assured, easily discouraged.</p>
<p>你可以愚弄智力。做到这一点并不难。但要愚弄内识却非常困难。在这里，人们被愚弄的唯一方式就是他们对内识缺乏足够的察觉。他们不使用内识。他们不咨询内识。他们不用内识进行反思。因此，他们的智力很容易被诱惑，很容易被说服，很容易被保证，很容易被挫败。</p>
<p>So We have two problems: people do not look ahead sufficiently and people do not utilize the great gift of Knowledge that God has placed within them.</p>
<p>因此，我们有两个问题：人们没有充分展望未来，人们没有善用上帝放置在他们内心深处的内识这份伟大的礼物。</p>
<p>By looking ahead, you want to look ahead many years, without assuming that everything around you will be the same—without assuming that your economy will be strong or even functional; without assuming that your health care system will be functional; without assuming that you will have all of the advantages that you have.</p>
<p>通过展望未来，你需要展望许多年，而不是假设你周围的一切都会保持不变——不要假设你们的经济将是强劲的，甚至是正常运转的；不要假设你们的医疗系统将会正常运作；不要假设你将继续享有你所拥有的一切优势。</p>
<p>You must look without assumptions to the very best of your ability. Not with hope, not with fear, but just looking—the way that a sailor would look from the top of the mast of a sailing ship, looking out, scanning the horizon, seeing what can be seen. Not hoping, not wishing, not fearing—just looking. A lookout.</p>
<p>你必须尽你所能，不带假设地去看。不要怀着希望，不要心存恐惧，而只是观察——就像水手站在帆船桅杆顶端观察一样，眺望远方，扫视地平线，看看能看到什么。不是希望，不是愿望，也不是恐惧——只是观察。一种眺望。</p>
<p>This is a fundamental skill. The beasts in the field are doing this. The birds in the air are doing this. But people are preoccupied with their thoughts, with their plans, with their goals, with their problems, with their resentments, with their issues with one another.</p>
<p>这是一项基本技能。田野里的野兽就是这样。空中的鸟儿也是这样。但人们却专注于他们的思想、他们的计划、他们的目标、他们的问题、他们的怨恨、他们彼此之间的矛盾。</p>
<p>They are not looking. They are not listening. So they do not see the signs of the world. And they do not hear the signs from Knowledge within themselves, so preoccupied they are with their own thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>他们没有看。他们没有听。因此，他们看不到世界的迹象。他们听不到来自他们自己内在内识的迹象，因为他们太专注于他们自己的思想和感受了。</p>
<p>The future is not as mysterious as you think if you can pay attention, so long as you do not try to be specific regarding dates and times. That always fools people. People will say: “Oh, this date is going to be a very significant year. It is prophesied in the ancient texts.” But never hold to a date.</p>
<p>只要你能留心观察，未来并不像你想象的那样神秘，只要你不试图具体说明日期和时间。这总是会愚弄人们。人们会说：“哦，这个日期将是一个非常重要的年份。这是古代文献中预言的”。但永远不要坚持一个日期。</p>
<p>Time is a human creation. The future is always shifting, depending on what is happening today and tomorrow and the days to come. An event may be inevitable, but you cannot tell precisely when it will happen. Therefore, do not prophesy using dates and times. That will get you into trouble, and you will find yourself mistaken and discouraged as a result.</p>
<p>时间是人类创造的。未来总是在变化，取决于今天、明天和未来的日子。一个事件可能是不可避免的，但你无法准确知道它何时发生。因此，不要用日期和时间来预言。这只会给你带来麻烦，结果你会发现你自己误入歧途，并感到沮丧。</p>
<p>What is important is to see the movement of things—where your economy is going, where the world is going, where your life is going, where other people’s lives are going, seeing the movement of things, discerning the direction, discerning the possible outcomes. As long as you do not affix a date to it, it could be very insightful.</p>
<p>重要的是要看到事物的动向——你的经济将走向何方，世界将走向何方，你的生命将走向何方，其他人的生命将走向何方，看清事物的动向，辨别方向，辨别可能的结果。只要你不给它贴上日期，它就可能非常具有洞察力。</p>
<p>People do not ask the really important questions when they are establishing their relationships with one another, or when they are making fundamental decisions because they are not paying attention, and they are not looking ahead.</p>
<p>人们在建立彼此关系时，或者在做出根本性的决定时，并不会问出真正重要的问题，因为他们没有集中注意力，也没有向前看。</p>
<p>For example, regarding your work and career, particularly if you are a young person or a person who is changing your work and career, you must seek work that can survive very difficult economic times. You must provide goods or services that will be fundamentally necessary under very stressful economic conditions. No one is going to need other kinds of services. Very few people will even be able to afford them, and so they will largely disappear.</p>
<p>例如，关于你的工作和职业，特别是如果你是一个年轻人或一个正在改变你的工作和职业的人，你必须寻找能够在非常困难的经济时期生存下来的工作。你必须提供在非常紧张的经济条件下必不可少的商品或服务。没有人会需要其他类型的服务。甚至只有极少数人能够负担得起这些服务，因此这些服务将在很大程度上消失。</p>
<p>But if you did not have this understanding of the future, then you could make an extremely unwise decision and invest yourself greatly in your endeavor, only to have the circumstances turn against you. And all of this could have been foreseen in the past had you been looking carefully.</p>
<p>但是，如果你对未来没有这种理解，那么你可能会做出一个极其不明智的决定，在你的事业中投入你自己大量的资金，结果却事与愿违。而如果你仔细观察，这一切在过去都是可以预见的。</p>
<p>To be driven by desires and wishes and preferences is blind and foolish if you do not understand the environment in which they will be expressed. Environments: the physical environment, the economic environment, the political environment, the circumstances; if the circumstances are not conducive, then even the best idea in the world will not function, will not be able to be successful.</p>
<p>受欲望、愿望和偏好的驱使是盲目和愚蠢的。如果你不理解这些欲望、愿望和偏好所处的环境，那么就会变得盲目和愚蠢。环境：物质环境、经济环境、政治环境、局势；如果局势不利，那么即使是世界上最好的想法也无法发挥作用，无法取得成功。</p>
<p>People hope the environment will be there for them. They expect it to be there for them. And so they launch themselves on some great economic endeavor or personal endeavor only to find out that their timing was all off, that they did not consider their environment, they did not look far enough ahead. They assumed the future would be like the past, and so they launched themselves at the wrong time and then headed into stormy waters.</p>
<p>人们希望环境能为他们服务。他们期望环境会支持他们。因此，他们开始从事一些伟大的经济事业或个人事业，却发现他们的时机完全不对，他们没有考虑到他们的环境，他们没有把目光放得足够长远。他们认为未来会和过去一样，所以他们在错误的时间启动了他们自己，然后驶入了惊涛骇浪之中。</p>
<p>Any endeavor that you seek to initiate that will be long term, you must consider the environment very carefully, very objectively, even fearlessly. Will that endeavor have support? Will the economy support this in the future? Will people need this in the future? Will it be a priority for them under difficult economic times?</p>
<p>任何你想要发起的长期事业，你都必须非常谨慎、非常客观、甚至毫不畏惧地考虑环境。这项事业会得到支持吗？未来的经济会支持这项事业吗？人们在未来是否会需要它？在经济困难时期，这会成为他们的优先事项吗？</p>
<p>People are looking backwards, but moving forwards. And so when they crash into things, they are shocked. They did not see it coming because they were not looking, because they were assuming and believing, hoping and wishing while life was moving.</p>
<p>人们在向后看，但却在向前走。因此，当他们撞上东西时，他们会感到震惊。他们没有预见到，因为他们没有在看，因为在生命前进的过程中，他们只是在假设和相信、希望和愿望。</p>
<p>It is like being in an automobile, moving. Everything is coming at you. Would you be looking out the rear view mirror? Would you have your attention diverted for more than a moment when everything is coming at you in your pathway? Life is like this, though more in slow motion. If you are not paying attention, you will have a disaster.</p>
<p>它就像坐在一辆行驶的汽车里。一切都在向你驶来。你会看后视镜吗？当一切都在你前进的道路上向你驶来时，你会转移注意力超过片刻吗？生命就是这样，虽然更像慢动作。如果你不注意，你就会遇到灾难。</p>
<p>Before great events happen, there are signs. There is a buildup. Even if it is an earthquake, and it cannot be predicted, within yourself you will feel signs. You will feel anxiety, unreasonable anxiety. You will feel caution and fear without being able to identify its cause. You will feel unsettled. And if that occurs, you must set yourself down and say to yourself: “What is the source of these feelings? Are these feelings associated with anything I am doing at the moment? Are these feelings associated with the environment around me, any change in that environment? Is there something I must see or do at this time?”</p>
<p>大事发生之前，都会有迹象。这是一种积聚。即使是无法预测的地震，你的内心也会感受到迹象。你会感到焦虑，无端的焦虑。你会感到谨慎和恐惧，却无法确定其原因。你会感到不安。如果出现这种情况，你必须静下心来，对你自己说：“这些感觉的根源是什么？这些感觉与我目前正在做的事情有关吗？这些感觉与我周围的环境、环境中的任何变化有关吗？此时此刻，我是否必须去看或去做什么？</p>
<p>You must take advantage of these moments of discomfort. They are important. People say, “Oh, I felt bad last night. I was so anxious, and I was disturbed. I could not sleep, but I feel better now.”</p>
<p>你必须利用这些不适的时刻。它们很重要。人们会说：“哦，我昨晚感觉很糟糕。我太焦虑了，心烦意乱。我睡不着，但现在感觉好多了。”</p>
<p>This is stupid. You do not feel unreasonably anxious for no reason. Something is trying to communicate to you. You are responding to something, perhaps beyond your immediate circumstances, and you are just treating it as if it is just an emotional episode.</p>
<p>这是愚蠢的。你不会无缘无故地感到焦虑不安。内识正在试图与你沟通。你正在对某些事情做出回应，也许是你眼前的情况之外的事情，而你只是把它当作一个情绪小插曲。</p>
<p>Some people think that any fear or anxiety is a bad thing, and so they try to be happy all day long. That is so foolish. They are missing all the signs. They are not allowing their delicate inner guidance system to work for them. They think that any troubled thought or any anxiety somehow runs counter to their expectations and beliefs. If that is the case for you, you should change your expectations and beliefs because you are not taking advantage of the power and the presence of Knowledge to alert you, to warn you, to get your attention, to re-engage you with your environment.</p>
<p>有些人认为，任何恐惧或焦虑都是坏事，因此他们整天都试图保持快乐。这是愚蠢的。他们忽略了所有的迹象。他们不允许他们微妙的内在指导系统为他们工作。他们认为任何烦恼的想法或焦虑都会以某种方式违背他们的期望和信念。如果你是这种情况，你就应该改变你的期望和信念，因为你没有采纳内识的力量和存在来提醒你、警告你、引起你的注意、让你重新接触到你的环境。</p>
<p>Young people emerge from their schooling, thinking: “Oh, what do I want to do with my life? What would make me happy? What would be rewarding?” But they rarely look at the environment or consider the future. They just think if they do what they want, everything will work out. Well, everything will work out, but not to their advantage or to their expectation.</p>
<p>年轻人从他们的学校毕业后，会想：“哦，我这辈子想做什么？什么会让我快乐？什么会是有意义的？”但他们很少关注环境或考虑未来。他们只是认为，如果他们做他们想做的事情，一切都会好起来。好吧，一切都会好起来，但对他们来说并不有利，也不一定符合他们的期待。</p>
<p>The environment is very important. If you cease to consider it, it will work against you, and it will defeat you. You have a dynamic relationship with your environment—with the natural environment, with the economic environment, with the political environment, with the social environment, who you are with and their influences upon you. All of these environments can either work for you or against you depending on how you engage yourself with them, and what you choose to do, and how you plan your activities, and the degree of attention you bring to your circumstances.</p>
<p>环境是非常重要的。如果你不再考虑它，它就会对你不利，就会打败你。你与环境有着一种动态的关系——自然环境、经济环境、政治环境、社会环境、你与谁在一起以及他们对你的影响。所有这些环境都可以对你有利，也可以对你不利，这取决于你如何与它们打交道，你选择做什么，你如何规划你的活动，以及你对你所处环境的关注程度。</p>
<p>You should think of your life like sailing across a great ocean, a great ocean which can be calm and peaceful or turbulent and stormy, where the winds vary, where the currents vary. You must have provisions for this journey. You must have skill to take this journey.</p>
<p>你应该去思考你的生命，生命就像是在大海上航行，大海有时风平浪静，有时波涛汹涌，风向和潮流时刻变化着。你必须为这段旅程做好准备。你必须具备踏上这段旅行的技能。</p>
<p>You must know what to avoid and how to respond to certain kinds of difficulties. You must always be watching the environment. In a sailing ship of any size out on the ocean, you must be very, very observant and be able to read the signs of your changing environment—the change in the wind, the degree of turbulence in the ocean, reading the clouds.</p>
<p>你必须知道应该避免什么，以及如何应对特定的困难。你必须时刻关注周围的环境。在大海上航行的任何大小的帆船上，你都必须非常非常善于观察，能够读懂周围环境变化的迹象——风向的变化、海洋湍流的程度、云层的变化。</p>
<p>So many people just launch their lives and find themselves shipwrecked somewhere down the coast, floundering out in open waters. Some people sink all together. They underestimated the power and the potency of their environment. So many business endeavors have failed, marriages have failed, because people did not respect the environment and the demands of life, were ill prepared, did not choose correctly or did not time their activities appropriately.</p>
<p>许多人刚踏上生命的征程，就发现他们自己在海岸边的某个地方遇难了，漂浮在茫茫大海中。有些人彻底沉没了。他们低估了他们环境的力量和潜力。许多商业冒险失败了，婚姻也失败了，因为人们没有尊重环境和生命的要求，准备不足，没有做出正确的选择，或者没有在合适的时机采取行动。</p>
<p>They were not with Knowledge at the point of decision—not paying attention to the signs, not exerting enough care and caution here, urged on by others, urged on by their own desires, urged on by the fear of losing out, missing an opportunity. They took the plunge only to find that the water in the pool was very shallow.</p>
<p>他们在做决定时，没有与内识同行——没有注意到迹象，没有在这里施加足够的关心和谨慎，被他人推动，被他们自己的欲望推动，被害怕错失机会的恐惧推动。他们跳入池中，却发现池水很浅。</p>
<p>Humanity is now facing Great Waves of change, greater than anything the human family as a whole has ever had to face before—environmental degradation; diminishing resources; violent weather; economic and political instability; the growing risk of competition, conflict and war over the remaining resources; and a growing population of people in the world drinking from a slowly shrinking well.</p>
<p>人类现在正面临变革的巨浪，比人类作为一个整体过去曾经面对过的任何事情都要巨大——环境的退化；资源的减少；恶劣的天气；经济和政治不稳定；为争夺剩余资源而发生竞争、冲突和战争的风险不断增长；以及世界上越来越多的人口饮用着一口慢慢萎缩的井水。</p>
<p>That represents a very challenging and difficult environment. That requires great care and skill. How are you going to navigate the difficult times ahead? How are you going to know what to do in the face of change you did not anticipate, change that very few people anticipated?</p>
<p>这是一个极具挑战性和艰难的环境。这需要极大的谨慎和技巧。你将如何度过未来的困难时期？面对你没有预料到的变化，面对很少有人预料到的变化，你如何知道该怎么做？</p>
<p>Better to be cautious here than overly optimistic. But you still must take this journey. You cannot go hide under a rock somewhere or lock yourself in a closet.</p>
<p>与其过于乐观，不如谨慎行事。但你仍然必须踏上这段旅程。你不能躲在石头底下或把你自己锁在柜子里。</p>
<p>Do not lose heart, for you have come into the world for a greater purpose, to live in these turbulent and uncertain times. God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you and to protect you and to enable you to take the steps to discovering your greater work and service in the world. But this requires a kind of strength and sobriety, clarity and self-honesty, that very few people have forged within themselves appropriately.</p>
<p>不要灰心，因为你来到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的，为了生活在这个动荡和不确定的时期。上帝已经把内识放置在你的内在，来指引你、保护你，并让你能够采取步骤去发现你在世界上的更伟大工作和服务。但是，这需要一种力量和清醒、清晰和自我诚实，而很少有人能在他们自己的内在恰当地锻造出这些。</p>
<p>You cannot be fooling around in the face of the Great Waves of change. You cannot be playing on the beach when the Great Waves come, or have your back to the ocean. This is symbolic of what humanity is doing right now.</p>
<p>面对变革的巨浪，你不能胡闹。巨浪来临时，你不能在沙滩上玩耍，也不能背对着大海。这象征着人类现在正在做的事情。</p>
<p>There are a few people who are aware of the Great Waves of change, who are trying to sound an alarm, but their voices are drowned out by ignorance and indifference and the insistence upon the preservation of affluence. They are alone in their admonitions because people are not paying attention, and they do not have yet the strength to face great uncertainty even though God has placed this strength within them.</p>
<p>一些少数的人察觉到了变革的巨浪，他们试图敲响警钟，但他们的声音被无知、冷漠和对维护富裕的坚持淹没了。他们的告诫是孤独的，因为人们没有注意到，他们还没有力量去面对巨大的不确定性，尽管上帝已经把这种力量放置在他们的内心。</p>
<p>The power and the presence of Knowledge is here to guide you and to protect you, but you must take the Steps to Knowledge and become strong in Knowledge. Here you must set aside your fears and your hopes, your nightmares and your strong preferences, to look and to see carefully, to be as objective as you can, to take your environment very seriously, to observe other people to learn from their mistakes and from their strengths, to stop your endless complaining and to end condemnation of others so that you may learn from their example.</p>
<p>在这里，内识的力量和存在指引着你、保护着你，但你必须开展内识的进阶，并在内识中变得强大。在这里，你必须抛开你的恐惧和希望、抛开你的噩梦和强烈的喜好，仔细地观察，尽可能客观，非常严肃地对待你的环境，观察其他人，从他们的错误和长处中学习，停止你无休止的抱怨并结束对他人的谴责，这样你才能从他们的榜样中学习。</p>
<p>Here the whole world can teach you what works and what does not work, what will work for you and what will not work for you. But you cannot learn any of this if you judge the world for disappointing your expectations, if you are consumed with your own interests and desires and problems because you are not paying attention. You are not being a student of life.</p>
<p>在这里，整个世界都可以教你什么有效，什么无效，什么对你有用，什么对你无用。但是，如果你因为世界辜负了你的期望而对它妄加评论，如果你因为不注意而沉迷于你自己的兴趣、欲望和问题，你就无法学到这些。你没有成为一名生命的学生。</p>
<p>So you will not know what to do in the difficult times ahead. You will be swept along. And when you finally decide to take action, it will be too late because everyone will be taking action, and it will be a panic. It will be chaos. The stores will be empty. The banks will be closed. There will be social unrest. And you will be caught in the middle of a situation that you could have escaped had you planned previously.</p>
<p>因此，在未来的困难时期，你将不知道该做些什么。你将会被卷入其中。当你最终决定采取行动时，已为时已晚，因为每个人都会采取行动，它将会引起恐慌。它将是一片混乱。商店将空空如也。银行将关闭。社会将动荡不安。你将陷入一个本可以通过事先规划逃脱的局面。</p>
<p>You must now be very cautious. Caution is different from fear. Fear is a kind of blind reaction, a kind of paralyzing experience. But caution is observant. It is objective. It is inquiring. You are looking to see what you must see. You are taking great care with your actions and your thoughts and your decisions. That is being cautious.</p>
<p>你现在必须非常谨慎。谨慎不同于恐惧。恐惧是一种盲目的反应，是一种麻痹的体验。但谨慎是一种观察。它是客观的。它是探究的。你正在观察你必须看到的事情。你对你的行为、你的思想和你的决定都非常谨慎。这就是谨慎。</p>
<p>That is what is appropriate here. To be fearful is to cease to be observant. It is to be taken up in your own reaction. It is to be held in place. It is to withdraw and contract. There is little wisdom here.</p>
<p>在这里，谨慎是最合适的。恐惧就是停止观察。它使你陷入你自己的反应之中，它使你停滞不前。它使你退缩和收缩。这里没有什么智慧可言。</p>
<p>But if you are not prepared for great change, you will react in this way. You will be paralyzed with fear. You will be outraged. You will be confused. You will have no plan. You will not know what to do. You will blame other people. You will take desperate actions. You will follow other people who are taking desperate actions. You will put your life at greater risk and greater danger.</p>
<p>但是，如果你没有为伟大的变革做好准备，你就会做出这样的反应。你会因恐惧而不知所措。你会感到愤怒。你会感到困惑。你将没有计划。你不知道该做什么。你会责怪他人。你会采取绝望的行动。你会追随那些铤而走险的人。你会将你的生命置于更大的风险和更大的危险之中。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change will either defeat humanity or require that humanity grow up and become mature and responsible and united. Humanity must cooperate to face the Great Waves of change. You cannot be a warring set of tribes and cultures, or the Great Waves will just destroy what you have created.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪要么会击败人类，要么会要求人类成长起来，变得成熟、负责和团结。人类必须合作来面对变革的巨浪。你们不能是一个充满战争的部落和文化集合，否则巨浪只会摧毁你们所创造的一切。</p>
<p>This is a great time for humanity. The Great Waves of change have largely been produced by humanity’s abuse and overuse of the world; its reckless use of resources; and its lack of concern for the future, lack of awareness of the future and lack of preparation for the future. It is this desperate, irresponsible, reckless behavior that is now getting you into such trouble and will only produce greater difficulties now as you proceed.</p>
<p>这是人类的一个伟大时代。变革的巨浪在很大程度上是由人类对世界的滥用和过度使用、对资源的不计后果的使用以及对未来的漠视、对未来的缺乏觉知和对未来的缺乏准备造成的。正是这种孤注一掷、不负责任、不计后果的行为现在让你们陷入了如此困境，而且随着你们的前进，只会带来更大的困难。</p>
<p>Everyone wants economic growth, but you are facing a world in decline. Everyone wants to have as much wealth as they have now and more, but humanity is drinking from a shrinking well. What you want and where the world is going can be so very different here. What you expect and what is coming over the horizon can be so very different.</p>
<p>每个人都希望经济增长，但你面对的是一个衰落的世界。每个人都希望拥有和现在一样多的财富，甚至更多，但人类正在从一口不断萎缩的井中喝水。在这里，你想要的和世界的发展方向可能截然不同。你所期待的和地平线上即将出现的变革巨浪可能截然不同。</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the power of nature and the consequences of altering nature. Everyone has had a part in doing this, and everyone will have to bring skill and ability and the willingness to unite and cooperate to face the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world.</p>
<p>不要低估自然的力量和改变自然的后果。每个人都参与其中，每个人都必须带着技能和能力，以及团结与合作的意愿，来面对即将到来世界的变革巨浪。</p>
<p>Knowledge will teach you what to do step by step, but you must undertake a real and deep evaluation of your life and current circumstances.</p>
<p>内识会一步一步地教你该做什么，但你必须对你的生命和当前的处境进行一种真正而深入的评估。</p>
<p>What is the sustainability of your work? Of your home? Of your transportation? Where do you get your food and energy? What are the resources of your community? How will you get to work if there is no petroleum available? How will you deal with food shortages and ever-increasing prices of everything?</p>
<p>你工作的可持续性如何？你的家如何？你的交通工具呢？你从哪里获取食物和能源？你所在的社区有哪些资源？如果没有石油，你将如何上班？如果出现粮食短缺以及物价不断上涨，你将如何应对？</p>
<p>You have to think ahead now. It takes courage. It is unsettling. It might even be terrifying at first. But if you keep your attention here, you will gain a greater objectivity, and the waves of fear will pass. And you will learn to become observant and cautious, careful in what you do.</p>
<p>你现在必须提前考虑。它需要勇气。它是令人不安的。一开始甚至会让你感到恐惧。但如果你把注意力集中在这里，你将获得更大的客观性，恐惧的浪潮也会过去。你将学会变得善于观察和谨慎，做事小心谨慎。</p>
<p>But it must begin with a great evaluation of where you live, how you live, how you travel, how you use resources, the strength of your relationships. Do the people around you have any sense of what is coming over the horizon? Or are they just foolishly playing in the sand or carrying out their own objectives without any awareness of the great change in your environment?</p>
<p>但是，首先必须对你的居住地、生活方式、旅行方式、资源使用方式以及人际关系的强度进行一种深入评估。你周围的人对地平线上即将到来的变革巨浪有任何感知吗？或者，他们只是愚蠢地在沙堆里玩耍，或者只是在执行他们自己的目标，而丝毫没有觉知到你们所处环境的伟大变革？</p>
<p>This evaluation will take time because it requires many things, and it will require changing many things and redirecting perhaps the course of your life entirely. But time is the problem. Time is of the essence. You do not have a great deal of time to prepare for the Great Waves of change. Every month and every year are very significant now.</p>
<p>这种评估将需要时间，因为它需要许多东西，需要改变许多事情，也许需要完全改变你的生命轨迹。但时间就是问题所在。时间至关重要。你没有太多的时间来为变革巨浪做准备。现在，每一个月和每一年都非常重要。</p>
<p>If you are living in the wrong place, if you are poorly positioned, you will reach a point when you cannot do anything about it except take a great loss. You thought the future was going to be like the past, so you invested in that way, under that assumption, and now you find yourself in jeopardy.</p>
<p>如果你生活在一个错误的地方，如果你的位置不佳，那么你就会到达一个除了遭受巨大损失之外什么也做不了的地步。你认为未来会和过去一样，所以你以这种方式、在这种假设下进行了投资，而现在你发现你自己处于危险之中。</p>
<p>This is the challenge of life. It has always been the challenge of life. But now the challenge is so much greater.</p>
<p>这就是生命的挑战。它一直都是生命的挑战。但现在的挑战要大得多。</p>
<p>The people in wealthy nations have lost contact with nature. They have lost their ability to be discerning and cautious and aware. They have become complacent and self-assured, living on assumptions that their wealth would continue, and their privileges would be supported, and their environment would continue to provide endlessly for their desires and their needs.</p>
<p>富裕国家的人们已经与大自然失去了联系。他们已经失去了辨别力、谨慎和警觉的能力。他们变得沾沾自喜，自以为是，认为他们的财富会继续下去，他们的特权会得到支持，他们的环境会继续无休止地为他们的欲望和需求提供资源。</p>
<p>While the poorer people are facing the reality every day—the problem of resources; the problem of security; the problem of protecting themselves and their families; the problem of acquiring sufficient food, water and medicine—they are wiser by far than the wealthiest amongst you. They are closer to reality. And now reality will reassert itself everywhere, even in the rich nations.</p>
<p>虽然穷人每天都要面对现实——资源问题、安全问题、保护他们自己和家人的问题、获得足够的食物、水和药品的问题——而他们却比你们中最富有的人要明智得多。他们更接近现实。现在，现实将在任何地方重新显现，即使在富裕国家也是如此。</p>
<p>No one will escape the Great Waves of change. And the wealthier you are, the more you have to lose, and the more concern you will have in protecting what you have, and the greater will be your vulnerability in facing a world of needy people.</p>
<p>没有人能逃脱变革的巨浪。你越富有，你失去的就越多，你就越需要保护你所拥有的一切，而在面对一个充满贫困人群的世界时，你的脆弱性也会越大。</p>
<p>This is a problem that will either defeat humanity or unite and uplift humanity. The decision is not only with governments or large institutions. It is with every single person. Every person must choose whether they will struggle, compete and fight or whether they will find ways to sustain themselves in concert with others.</p>
<p>这是一个要么会击败人类，要么会团结和振兴人类的问题。这个决定不仅在政府或大型机构手中，它在每个人的手中。每个人都必须选择，是继续挣扎、竞争和斗争，还是与他人合作，找到可持续生存的方式。</p>
<p>It is a fundamental decision in the face of grave circumstances. It is life. You may think it is calamitous, but you are really returning to a more authentic, grounded and genuine life. Instead of playing with your little technological toys, instead of losing yourself in your romances and your hobbies, you have to come back to life, to stand at the edge of life with all of its uncertainties, opportunities and dangers. Do not think that everything will turn out appropriately, for everything will turn out, but it will be a disaster for so many people.</p>
<p>它是在面对严峻形势时的一个根本性决定。它是生命。你可能认为这是灾难性的，但你实际上是在回归一种更真实、更踏实、更真诚的生命。不要再沉迷于你那些小小的科技玩具，不要在你的浪漫和你的爱好中迷失你自己，你必须回到生命，站在生命的边缘，面对所有的不确定性、机会和危险。不要认为一切都会适当转变，因为一切都会好起来，但对许多人来说，它将是一场灾难。</p>
<p>You have time to reconsider your life, to gain a greater degree of wisdom and discernment here, but you do not have much time. That is why this Message is so important. That is why the reality of Knowledge is so important. That is why looking far into the future with clear eyes is so important. That is why making plans and preparations and discerning how you will be able to take care of other people are so important.</p>
<p>你有时间重新考虑你的生命，在这里获得一种更伟大的智慧和辨别力，但你没有太多的时间。正因为如此，这条讯息是如此重要。正因为如此，内识的现实是如此重要。正因为如此，以清晰的目光看向遥远的未来是如此重要。正因为如此，制定计划和准备，辨别你将如何能够照顾他人是如此重要。</p>
<p>There will be people beyond your family that you might need to care for—the elderly, children without parents, disabled people, or simply people who just fell apart in the face of the Great Waves of change. You may have to take care of some of these people to a certain degree. How will you do that and with what?</p>
<p>除了家人之外，你还可能需要照顾其他人——老人、没有父母的孩子、残疾人，或者仅仅是那些在变革巨浪面前崩溃的人。你可能需要在一定程度上照顾这些人。你会怎么做，用什么来照顾他们？</p>
<p>These are things you should be thinking about now, before the storms arise in great number. You should be building your ark before the rains come and not wait until the last moment when there will be nothing to use to build an ark.</p>
<p>这些是你现在就应该考虑的事情，在暴风雨来临之前。你应该在暴风雨来临之前建造你的方舟，而不是等到最后一刻，那时已经没有任何东西可以用来建造方舟了。</p>
<p>This is why there is a New Message from God in the world because humanity is unprepared for the consequences of its own actions in the world—its lack of preparation, its lack of wisdom, its lack of responsibility and accountability—the results of which are now mounting and will continue to mount, relentlessly, as you move forward.</p>
<p>这就是为什么世界上出现了一条来自上帝的新讯息，因为人类对它自身在这个世界上的行为所造成的后果毫无准备——它缺乏准备、它缺乏智慧、它缺乏责任感和义务感——其结果现在正在不断积累，并将在你们前进的过程中持续不断地积累，毫不留情。</p>
<p>God loves humanity and does not want to see human civilization—which has taken so long to build, which has such great promise and great qualities—God does not want to see this fail and collapse. God does not want to see humanity fall prey to forces from beyond the world who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>上帝爱着人类，上帝不希望看到人类的文明——人类花了如此长时间才建立起来的文明，人类有着如此伟大的承诺和伟大的品质——上帝不想看到人类失败和崩溃。上帝不希望看到人类成为来自世界之外的势力的牺牲品，而这些势力来此就是为了利用软弱和分裂的人类。</p>
<p>That is why there is a New Message from God in the world. And that is why it is here to warn you about the Great Waves of change. It is here to provide the Steps to Knowledge and the preparation that will be needed—the preparation within each person, in how they engage with themselves, with other people and with the world itself.</p>
<p>这就是为什么世界上出现了一条来自上帝的新讯息。这也是为什么它在这里向你们发出关于变革巨浪的警告。它在这里提供内识的进阶和所需的准备——每个人内心的准备，如何与他们自己、与他人以及与世界本身互动的准备。</p>
<p>This will require great strength and courage. But your life is on the line, and so there should be sufficient motivation for you to have this strength and courage. And you must be very compassionate because people around you will become ever more distraught and confused. They will engage in self-destructive behaviors. They will act foolishly. And they will be delusional.</p>
<p>这将需要伟大的力量和勇气。但你的生命正面临威胁，因此，你应该有足够的动力去获得这种力量和勇气。而且，你必须充满同情心，因为你周围的人将变得越来越焦虑和困惑。他们会做出自我毁灭的行为。他们会愚蠢行事。他们会陷入妄想。</p>
<p>You must have great compassion, for humanity as a whole is not prepared for the Great Waves of change. It is not prepared for the Intervention that is taking place in the world by races from beyond the world. It is not prepared for life, for eventualities.</p>
<p>你必须怀有伟大的同情心，因为人类作为一个整体还没有为变革的巨浪做好准备。人类还没有为来自世界之外的种族在世界上进行的干预做好准备。人类还没有为生命、为可能发生的事件做好准备。</p>
<p>You must see the truth of what is coming, and you must have the strength, the power and the motivation to act—appropriately, wisely, carefully—using the wisdom of others to help you, using the resources of your community, reaching out to other people.</p>
<p>你必须看到即将到来的变革巨浪的真理，并且你必须拥有足够的实力、力量和动力来采取行动——适当地、明智地、谨慎地——使用他人的智慧来帮助你，使用你所在社区的资源，向其他人伸出援手。</p>
<p>For it is not about stockpiling food for the future. That will only work very temporarily. You are facing a very long set of circumstances. You have to reset your life, reposition yourself.</p>
<p>因为它不是为未来储备粮食。这只能起到暂时的作用。你面临的是一系列非常长期的局势。你必须重新设定你的生命，重新定位你自己。</p>
<p>That is why the Great Waves of change, though calamitous and extremely dangerous, also can be redemptive. They require a greater honesty, a greater capacity and a greater responsibility in people. This is redemptive because you have come to the world to serve the world. If that service is not being activated, if it is not being realized and expressed, then you are failing your fundamental mission in life.</p>
<p>正因为如此，变革的巨浪虽然是灾难性的、极其危险的，但也可以是救赎性的。它们要求人们具有一种更伟大的诚实、一种更伟大的能力和一种更伟大的责任感。这是救赎性的，因为你来到这个世界就是为了服务世界。如果这种服务没有被激活，如果这种服务没有被实现和表达，那么你就没有完成你在生命中的基本使命。</p>
<p>Whether you are rich and live in splendor, you will feel uncomfortable, restless and anxious because you are not engaged in your greater activity in the world. You are not fulfilling the need of the soul. You are not finding and expressing your greater purpose for being here.</p>
<p>无论你是否富有，生活是否富足，你都会感到不舒服、不安和焦虑，因为你没有参与你在这个世界上的更伟大活动。你没有满足灵魂的需求。你没有找到和表达你在这里的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>Once you get beyond your fear and anxiety, you begin to see that the Great Waves of change are connected to who you are and why you are here. And that is a very significant realization. That presents a real shift in how you will see and understand the greatness of your times and the power that God has placed within you—to face them and to serve them and to live meaningfully within them.</p>
<p>一旦你超越了你的恐惧和焦虑，你就会开始看到，变革的巨浪与你是谁以及你为何在这里息息相关。这是一个非常重要的领悟。它代表着一种真正的转变，让你看到并理解你所处时代的伟大，以及上帝放置在你内心深处的力量——去面对它们、服务它们并在它们之中有意义地生活。</p>
