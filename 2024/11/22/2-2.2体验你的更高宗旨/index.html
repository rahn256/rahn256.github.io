<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on August 30, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年8月30日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have come here for a greater purpose—to serve a world that will be facing Great Waves of change. You are designed to provide a unique contribution in concert with certain other individuals whom you will have the opportunity to meet in the course of your life.</p>
<p>你来到这里是为了一个更伟大的目的——为这个即将面临巨变的世界服务。你注定（被设计）要与一些特定的人一起提供独特的贡献，这些人在你的生命的过程中将有机会与你相遇。</p>
<p>You are born into the world with your memory of your Ancient Home temporarily forgotten, to enable you to focus on your development here, and to give you incentive to be here in this world that is difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>你出生在这个世界上时，暂时遗忘了对古老家园的记忆，这是为了让你能够专注于在这里的发展，并激励你留在这个充满困难和问题的世界</p>
<p>Your greater purpose for coming into the world is embedded deep within you. It is being held within a deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you, an Intelligence called Knowledge. This greater purpose is beyond the realm and the scope of your intellect. You cannot figure it out. You do not know what it is, what it will mean or where it will take you. It remains a mystery within you. It is not what you think.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界的更伟大目的深深地埋藏在你内心的深处。它被保存在上帝放置在你内心的一个更深层次的智能中，这个智能被称为内识。这个更伟大目的超越了你的智力的领域和范围。你无法通过思考来弄明白它。你不知道它是什么，它意味着什么，它会带你去哪里。它仍然是你内心的一个谜。它并非你所想的那样。</p>
<p>The discovery, the experience and the fulfillment of this greater purpose represent your great endeavor in the world and the one thing that will satisfy the deeper needs of your soul. For no amount of pleasure, comfort, splendor or enjoyment will meet this deeper need of the soul, except the realization and the expression of this greater purpose. This greater purpose will be called out of you by certain conditions in the world and by meeting certain individuals who are destined to be a part of your greater work here.</p>
<p>发现、体验和实现这个更伟大的目的，是你在这个世界上的伟大努力，也是满足你灵魂更深层次需求的唯一事情。因为除了认知和表达这个更伟大目的之外，任何快乐、舒适、辉煌或享乐都无法满足灵魂这个更深层次的需求。这个更伟大目的将通过世界上的特定条件，以及通过遇见注定要成为你在此更伟大工作一部分的特定个体而被从你身上召唤出来。</p>
<p>You cannot call this out of yourself. Even if you engaged in the most rigorous spiritual practice, you could not initiate this within yourself. For the answer is within you, but the calling is out in the world because you are here to bring something into the world. A set of circumstances, a great need, a pressing problem, the needs of certain people, or even, in some cases, the needs of one person may be the catalyst for the emergence of this greater purpose in your life.</p>
<p>你无法从你自己身上召唤出这个目的。即使你从事最严格的精神实践，你也无法在你自己的内心启动这一切。因为答案就在你的内心，但召唤却在外面的世界，因为你来到这个世界是为了给这个世界带来一些东西。一系列的环境、一种伟大的需求、一个紧迫的问题、特定人的需求，甚至在某些情况下，一个人的需求，都可能是你生命中这个更伟大目的出现的催化剂。</p>
<p>This is really what your life is about and what it is for. It is meant to re-engage you with the Presence of God in your life and the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you. It is meant to engage you with people at a higher level, representing relationships of a higher purpose. It is meant to engage you with the world in a way that represents your purpose and your destiny here.</p>
<p>这正是你生命的意义所在，也是你存在的目的。它旨在重新将你与上帝的存在联系起来，并唤起上帝在你内心深处放置的更深层次的内识。它旨在让你与他人建立更高层面的关系，代表一种更高宗旨的关系。它旨在让你以一种代表着你在此的目的和天命的方式参与世界。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, that will alter the face of the world and the destiny of every person, represent the context in which your greater purpose will be called upon. The very circumstances that you would tend to avoid or to deny are the very circumstances that will call this greatness out of you.</p>
<p>即将降临世界的巨浪变革将改变世界的面貌和每个人的天命，它代表着你将在其中被召唤更伟大目的的背景。你倾向于回避或否认的那些情况，正是将你的伟大之处激发出来的情况。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change—resource depletion, changing climate and violent weather, diminishing production of food, ever-increasing economic and political instability and the growing risk of conflict and war—are all converging on the world at the same time. These are the Great Waves of change, and they are largely the product of humanity’s overuse and abuse of the world, humanity’s reckless demonstration here on Earth: human greed, human corruption, human ambition, human foolishness. Everyone is a part of this, especially in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪——资源枯竭、气候变化和恶劣天气、粮食产量的减少、日益加剧的经济和政治不稳定，以及日益增长的冲突和战争风险——都同时汇聚到世界各地。这些都是变革的巨浪，它们在很大程度上是人类过度使用和滥用地球的产物，是人类在地球上肆无忌惮的展示：人类的贪婪、人类的腐败、人类的野心、人类的愚蠢。每个人都是其中的一部分，尤其是在富裕的国家。</p>
<p>It is not your job here to blame and to condemn. And you really cannot assign blame fully upon any government leader or organization because you, too, if you live in a wealthy nation, have benefited from the exploitation of the world. You cannot complain when you yourself and everyone around you are a part of this great dilemma.</p>
<p>在这里，你的工作不是指责和谴责。你确实不能把责任完全归咎于任何政府领导人或组织，因为如果你生活在一个富裕的国家，你也从世界的剥削中获益。当你自己和你身边的每个人都是这个巨大困境的一部分时，你就不能抱怨。</p>
<p>Your task is not to blame and to condemn, but to bring a greater awareness into the world, to make your specific contribution, to allow it to emerge within you, and to find its true participants and its true recipients.</p>
<p>你的任务不是指责和谴责，而是将一种更伟大的觉知带入这个世界，做出你的具体贡献，让它在你的内心出现，并找到它真实的参与者和真实的接收者。</p>
<p>Your estimation of yourself in this regard is wholly inadequate. And like everyone around you, you have a pathetic view of yourself—only concerned with your needs, your desires and your fears, and the needs of certain other people around you.</p>
<p>在这方面，你对你自己的评价是完全不够的。就像你身边的每个人一样，你对你自己的看法也是可悲的——只关心你的需求、你的欲望和你的恐惧，以及身边某些人的需求。</p>
<p>But you have a greater responsibility in being in the world. You have a greater need. It is this that represents the deeper current of your life. It is this that will make your life comprehensible and comprehendible. There is a current that is consistent, that gives meaning and direction to your existence here.</p>
<p>但是你身处这个世界有着一种更伟大的责任。你有着一种更伟大的需求。正是它代表着你生命更深层次的潮流。正是它会让你的生命变得可理解和可领会。存在着一股始终如一的潮流，它为你在此的存在赋予意义和方向。</p>
<p>So the question arises: How will you be able to discover this greater purpose that seems so hidden within yourself? You may have clues; you may have signs that there is something about your life that is important, that you are here to do something important, that you are not here by accident. But what this really is, and what this will really mean and require remain hidden. You cannot figure it out.</p>
<p>因此问题出现了：你将如何能够发现这个似乎隐藏在你自己内心深处的更伟大目的？你可能会有一些线索；你可能会有一些迹象表明，你的生命中有一些重要的事情，你来到这里是为了做一些重要的事情，你在这里并不是偶然的。但这究竟是什么，这究竟意味着什么、需要什么，仍然是隐藏的。你无法弄清楚。</p>
<p>So how can it emerge within you? What will bring it forth? There are several things that will contribute to the emergence of a greater purpose in your life. The first is disappointment and disillusionment with your desires and pursuits, and the desires and pursuits of other people.</p>
<p>因此，它如何在你内心中显现出来呢？是什么将促使它显现？有几种情况会促使你的生命出现更伟大的目的。首先是对你的欲望和追求以及他人的欲望和追求感到失望和幻灭。</p>
<p>As you discover that the pleasures and the advantages and the desires of your family and friends are wholly inadequate to your needs, you are thrown back upon yourself, having now to reconsider your values and your priorities, coming to realize that people’s attempt to fulfill themselves with wealth and pleasure, enjoyment and security, are not enough to meet a kind of fundamental need.</p>
<p>当你发现你的家人和朋友的快乐、优势和愿望完全不能满足你的需求时，你就会重新审视你自己，重新考虑你的价值观和优先事项，并逐渐意识到人们试图用财富、快乐、享受和安全来满足他们自己，但这并不足以满足一种基本需求。</p>
<p>You feel this and you experience this within yourself. And it brings you back to reconsider your life and your obligations to others and to re-evaluate whatever relationships you have established thus far. For now, they seem superficial. They have become now instead of a focus, a distraction, an impediment, and you begin to realize that with few exceptions, the people around you who know you, even amongst your family, have no real idea of who you are and why you are here.</p>
<p>你会感受到这一点，你在你自己的内心也会体验到这一点。它让你重新思考你的生命和你对他人的义务，重新评估你迄今为止建立的任何关系。现在，它们似乎很肤浅。它们现在不再是一个焦点，而是一种干扰，一个障碍，你开始意识到，除了少数例外，你周围认识你的人，甚至是你的家人，都不知道你是谁，你为什么在这里。</p>
<p>This begins a time of isolation, a time where you realize your life is being set apart for something. It is a time of real confusion because you are still being governed to a large extent by your former values and aspirations, but now it is all thrown into question, and you are confused.</p>
<p>这会开启一段孤立的时期，一段你意识到你的生命被分离出来，为了某种事情而存在的时期。它是一段真正困惑的时期，因为你仍然在很大程度上受你以前的价值观和抱负的支配，但现在这一切都受到质疑，你感到困惑。</p>
<p>This confusion can be so intense you might think you are losing your mind, but really you are gaining a deeper awareness. But this awareness is not yet complete, and so you have many questions and few answers. But something now is beginning to move your life.</p>
<p>这种困惑可能会如此强烈，以至于你会认为你正在失去理智，但实际上你正在获得一种更深层次的觉知。但是，这种觉知还不完整，因此你有许多问题，却很少有答案。但现在内识正开始推动你的生命。</p>
<p>You are beginning to experience, now more frequently, the deeper current of your life. And while you go through the motions of your daily existence, meeting your responsibilities, there is something else that is happening in your life. It is as if your life were occurring on two different levels that seem to have very little to do with one another.</p>
<p>你开始更加频繁地体验你生命中更深层次的流动。当你在日常生活中履行责任时，你的生命中却有某种其他事情正在发生。就好像你的生命发生在两个不同的层面上，而这两个层面似乎彼此没有什么关系。</p>
<p>You are still a person. You are still engaged in education, perhaps employment. You are still growing as an individual. You are attending to daily affairs, either successfully or unsuccessfully. But there is a whole other movement in your life that seems to be happening in and of itself, regardless of what you do on the outside.</p>
<p>你仍然是一个人。你仍然在接受教育，也许在就业。你仍在成长为一个人。你正在处理日常事务，无论成功与否。但是，在你的生命中，似乎还有一种全新的运动，无论你在外面做什么，它本身都在发生。</p>
<p>Here you begin to lose interest in your former pursuits, even in your former relationships. Here you find that you are losing interest in what everyone else seems to be so actively and compulsively pursuing. Here your life is going through a kind of slow revolution, a kind of deep turning within yourself. It is like a sea change in your life, like a ship at sea that is slowly altering its course for an entirely different destination.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始对以前的追求失去兴趣，甚至对以前的关系也失去兴趣。在这里，你会发现你对其他人似乎都在积极地、强迫性地追求的事物失去了兴趣。在这里，你的生命正在经历一场缓慢的革命，一种你自己内心深处的转变。它就像你生命中的一场巨变，就像一艘在海上航行的船，正在慢慢改变航向，驶向一个完全不同的目的地。</p>
<p>During this time of reorientation, you are very confused. You do not quite know what is happening to you. You find your values are changing; your priorities are changing; your experiences are changing. You are being pulled out of the crowd, and your life is being set in a different direction.</p>
<p>在这段重新定位的时间里，你会感到非常困惑。你不知道你身上正在发生的事情。你发现你的价值观在改变；你的优先事项在改变；你的经历在改变。你被从人群中拉了出来，你的生命被推向了一个不同的方向。</p>
<p>Here it is very important not to commit yourself to any relationship, to any career, necessarily, or to anything until you can gain a greater sense of what you are to do and what this revolution within you really means. You will have moments when you feel exasperated. You will have moments when you feel hopeless and pathetic, when you seem to feel stupid, like you do not know what you are doing. You may be subject to other people’s ridicule and criticism.</p>
<p>在这里，非常重要的一点是，在你能更清楚地认识到你自己要做什么以及这场革命的真正意义之前，不要对任何关系、任何事业或任何事情做出承诺。你会有感到恼火的时刻。你会有感到绝望和可悲的时刻，你会觉得自己很愚蠢，就像你不知道自己正在做什么。你可能会受到他人的嘲笑和批评。</p>
<p>They will say, “What is wrong with you? You used to be such a fun person. What is your problem? Why are you so serious? Why don’t you want to do the things that we want to do with you?” And to them, you really have no good answer. Perhaps you will have to leave your relationships, and people will say, “Why are you doing this?” and you will really have no good answer for them.</p>
<p>他们会说：“你怎么了？你以前是那么有趣的一个人。你有什么问题吗？你为什么要这么严肃？你为什么不想做我们想和你一起做的事情？”对于他们，你真的没有好的答案。也许你将不得不离开你的人际关系，人们会说：“你为什么要这么做？”而你真的没有好的答案去回答他们。</p>
<p>But beneath the surface of your mind, at a deeper level within you, you are beginning now to move. You are beginning to become integrated within yourself. Before, you were living a kind of false life on the surface—to accommodate others, to meet the needs and expectations of others, and to try to satisfy your fundamental insecurities.</p>
<p>但是，在你心灵的表面之下，在你内心深处的一种更深层次的层面上，你现在开始有所变化。你开始在你自己的内心深处变得更加整合。之前，你过着一种表面上的虚假生命——迎合他人，满足他人的需求和期望，并试图满足你内心深处的根本不安全感。</p>
<p>But now, your life is moving, and you simply do not understand it yet. If you are religious, perhaps you will think that God is calling you, or changing you, or even punishing you. But still the greater movement of your life is remaining inexplicable. It is unreasonable, but it is so very genuine.</p>
<p>但现在，你的生命正在移动，而你还不理解。如果你有宗教信仰，也许你会认为上帝在召唤你，或者在改变你，甚至在惩罚你。但是，你生命中的更伟大运动仍然无法解释。这是不合理的，但却是如此真实。</p>
<p>Here it is important to support where you are going, to give yourself the benefit of the doubt and to muster up the courage to say no to the demands and expectations of others, and to say no to whatever forces within you that want you to return to your former life.</p>
<p>在这里，重要的是支持你正在前往的方向，给你自己一个疑虑的空间，并鼓起勇气对他人的要求和期望说不，同时对你内心那些想要你回到过去生命的力量说不。</p>
<p>Accept this transformation. It is slow and incremental because you must develop and maintain your stability while you are undergoing this most profound change within yourself. You are changing now, very fundamentally, but you do not know the reason; you do not know the outcome. And you cannot know these things.</p>
<p>接受这种转变。它是缓慢而渐进的，因为你必须在经历这种最深刻的内心改变的同时，发展并保持你的稳定性。你现在正在改变，非常根本性的改变，但你不知道原因，不知道结果。你无法知道这些事情。</p>
<p>It is like you are driving on a mountain, and the answer is on the other side of the mountain, and you cannot see around the corners. Like sailing a ship across the sea, you cannot see the farther shore. You have no idea what it looks like.</p>
<p>这就好比你在山路上行驶，而答案就在山的另一边，你看不到拐角处。就像驾船过海，你看不到更远的彼岸。你根本不知道它是什么样子。</p>
<p>The other thing that is supporting the emergence of your higher purpose in life are the changing circumstances of the world, particularly that arena in which you are destined to make a contribution. As it changes, as those circumstances change, it throws a hidden switch within you. All of a sudden your life is moving because it has a destiny, and the destiny is beyond your control.</p>
<p>支持你在生命中更高宗旨显现的另一个因素是世界环境的改变，特别是你注定要做出贡献的领域。随着这些环境的变化，它会在你内心深处打开一个隐藏的开关。突然间，你的生命开始前进，因为它有了一个天命，而这个天命是超出你控制的。</p>
<p>Yet it is necessary for you to understand that just because your life has a destiny does not mean that everything that happens to you is predetermined. It simply means that you are trying to get somewhere in your life. How you get there, what road you take, what obstacles you face in the changing circumstances of life can vary considerably. These things are not predetermined. It is your destiny that is predetermined, not how you will get there, or even if you will get there.</p>
<p>然而，你有必要理解，你的生命有一个天命，并不意味着发生在你身上的一切都是命中注定的。它仅仅意味着你的生命正在试图抵达某个目的地。在不断变化的生命环境中，你如何到达那里，走什么样的路，面临什么样的障碍，这些都可能千差万别。这些都不是注定的。预先注定的是你的天命，而不是你将如何到达那里，甚至是你能否到达那里。</p>
<p>For you must understand that having a destiny in life does not guarantee success. And failure in this regard is truly tragic, for once you realize you have a greater destiny, it is of the utmost importance that you fulfill that destiny, or the grave disappointment you will face will be so profound that nothing will be able to alleviate it.</p>
<p>因为你必须理解，在生命中拥有一个天命并不能保证成功。在这方面的失败是真正的悲剧，因为一旦你意识到你有一个更伟大的天命，那么实现这个天命就变得至关重要，否则你将面临的严重失望将是如此之深，以至于任何事情都无法缓解它。</p>
<p>That is why once you begin to feel a greater movement in your life, you must support it with as much strength as you can muster. For now it is not simply an option that you fulfill your destiny; it is a necessity.</p>
<p>这就是为什么一旦你开始感觉到生命中有一种更伟大的运动，你就必须尽你所能支持它。因为现在，实现你的天命不仅仅是一种选择；而是一种必需。</p>
<p>Your freedom here is the freedom to find and to fulfill your destiny. It is not a freedom to really deny your destiny. You have this freedom. But once you begin to feel and to recognize that your life is really moving, the choices become limited, and ultimately there is no choice. It is your freedom to bring you to this point of no choice.</p>
<p>你在这里的自由是找到并实现你天命的自由。它不是一种真正否定你天命的自由。你确实拥有这种自由。但是，一旦你开始感受到并认识到你的生命真的在前进，选择就会变得有限，最终你将没有选择。正是这种自由把你带到了这个“没有选择”的境地。</p>
<p>For once there is no choice, then real commitment and self-determination can arise. Then you can bring everything to bear. This is where you gain your strength, your power and your ability to overcome adversity in the world, and to weather the storms of the world, and to meet the challenges and the opportunities that your greater purpose will generate.</p>
<p>因为一旦没有选择，就会产生真正的承诺和自我决定。那时，你就可以全力以赴。这就是你获得实力、力量和能力的地方，去克服世界上的逆境，经受住世界上的风暴，迎接你的更伟大目的将带来的挑战和机会。</p>
<p>Right now you do not have this commitment. You do not have this strength. You do not have yet this self-determination. For these things must arise now around a greater destiny to be fully meaningful and to be truly beneficial.</p>
<p>现在，你还没有这种承诺。你还没有这个实力。你还没有这个自决。因为这些事情现在必须围绕一个更伟大的天命而出现，才能具有充分的意义并真正有益。</p>
<p>It takes determination to live in the world, and if you have a life-threatening event, that takes real determination also to overcome the threat to your existence. But, really, the real strength you must generate, the real skill and ability you must acquire, and the conviction within yourself will all arise around your following this greater purpose. You cannot follow it blindly, for there are many mistakes you can make along the way. And you can lose your way, for the world has many attractions and many seductions.</p>
<p>生活在这个世界上需要决心，如果你遇到了一个危及生命的事件，那也需要真正的决心来克服对你生存的威胁。但实际上，你必须产生的真正力量，你必须获得的真正技能和能力，以及你自己内心的信念，都将围绕着你追随这个更伟大的目的而产生。你不能盲目地追随它，因为沿途你可能会犯许多错误。你可能会迷失方向，因为这个世界有许多吸引力和诱惑。</p>
<p>It is not as if you simply give over the reins of your life and go along as if you were a passenger on a ship. Here you have to be the captain of the ship, and the crew. You have to be the master of your affairs. There is no passivity here. There is no idleness here. There is no blind faith that everything will work out for you. For, indeed, to assume a higher purpose in life is to go against the current of where almost everyone else is going.</p>
<p>它并不是说你只需将生命的缰绳交出，像船上的乘客一样随波逐流。在这里，你必须成为船长，同时也是船员。你必须是你事务的主人。这里没有被动，没有懈怠，也没有盲目的信仰认为一切都会顺利。因为，事实上，要承担起生命中更高的宗旨，意味着你要逆流而上，与大多数人所走的方向背道而驰。</p>
<p>It takes great strength and determination to do this. It takes real compassion for yourself and for other people to really advance here. It is a long journey. It will change your circumstances. It will require certain provisions. It will require a determined attitude. It will require real strength and perseverance. It is not like meeting the needs of the day. It is meeting the needs of an entire life.</p>
<p>要做到这一点，需要伟大的力量和决心。要想在这里取得真正的进步，需要对你自己和他人怀有真正的同情心。它是一段漫长的旅程。它将改变你的处境。它需要一定的准备和资源。它需要一种坚定的态度。它需要真正的力量和毅力。它不像满足一天的需要。它是满足整个生命的需求。</p>
<p>The events of the world will stimulate this and call you into action. Even if you do not feel or are aware of the calling itself, it will initiate you. Even if you are unaware of the events that are occurring, if they have to do with your ultimate purpose, they will ignite you.</p>
<p>世界上发生的事件会刺激你并召唤你采取行动。即使你感觉不到或察觉不到召唤本身，它也会启动你。即使你没有察觉到正在发生的事件，如果它们与你的最终目的有关，它们也会点燃你。</p>
<p>For you already have a relationship with the world because you have a greater purpose for being here. And even if that purpose is completely hidden, the events of the world will still strike you and initiate certain kinds of change within you.</p>
<p>因为你已然与世界建立了一种关系，因为你来到这里有一个更伟大的目的。即使这个目的被完全隐藏起来，世界上发生的事件仍然会冲击你，在你的内心深处引发某种改变。</p>
<p>Your mission in life will be launched, and you will not even know it. You will pass certain thresholds, and you will not even see them. Events will happen in the world beyond your awareness that will throw a switch within you, and you will not know what is happening. Your immediate circumstances do not give evidence to this sense of change that is occurring in your life.</p>
<p>你生命中的使命将会启动，而你甚至都不知道。你将跨过某些门槛，而你甚至都没有看到它们。世界上将发生一些超出你觉知的事件，这些事件会在你的内心深处启动开关，而你却不知道发生了什么。你当前的处境并没有证明你生命中正在发生的这种改变。</p>
<p>The third thing that will support the emergence of a greater purpose in your life is the arrival of certain relationships. These relationships are really not about recreation, hobbies, personal enjoyments. They are really of a deeper nature. They speak to something deeper within you. There is a kind of destiny with them, as if someone were actually sent into your life to effect a certain kind of change within you and to support a deeper awareness within you.</p>
<p>第三件能支持你生命中出现更伟大目的的事情是特定关系的到来。这些关系实际上并不关乎娱乐、爱好、个人享受。它们实际上是一种更深层次的自然。它们与你内心深处的内识讲话。它们有一种天命，就好像有人真的被派到你的生命中来影响你内心的某种改变并支持你内心深处的一种更深层次的觉知。</p>
<p>These are not casual friendships where you idly pass the time or indulge yourselves in a kind of hobby or obsession. There is something very different going on here. These people, whether they appear to be as friends or acquaintances or even teachers for you, will speak to something deeper and more profound in your experience.</p>
<p>这不是闲暇时打发时间或沉溺于某种爱好或痴迷中的休闲式友谊。这里发生的事情非常不同。这些人，无论他们是朋友还是熟人，甚至是你的老师，都会在你的经历中展现出更深层次且更深刻的内识。</p>
<p>You will sense, over time, should you have the good fortune to meet these people, that they really represent something bigger about your life. They are expanding your awareness. They are stirring something deeper within you. Your connection with them is at another level altogether. You may still have enjoyments together, and even do casual things, but really there is something else going on here.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，如果你有幸遇到这些人，你会感觉到他们确实代表着你生命中更大的关系。他们正在拓展你的觉知。他们正在激发你内心深处的内识。你和他们的联接完全在另一个层面上。你们或许仍然会一起享受生活，甚至做一些轻松的事情，但实际上，这背后有着不同寻常的事情在发生。</p>
<p>The fourth thing that will initiate the emergence of a greater purpose in your life is time. In this life, you only have so much time. You do not really know how much time you have, but you only have so much time. If your time is being wasted, or idly spent, it will wear upon you. As a deeper purpose begins to emerge in your experience, you will have a sense of the value of your time.</p>
<p>第四件让你生命中产生更伟大目的的事情是时间。在这个生命中，你的时间是有限的。你并不知道你有多少时间，但你只有这么多时间。如果你的时间被浪费了，或者被无谓地浪费了，它就会使你疲惫不堪。当一种更深层次的目的开始在你的经历中浮现时，你就会意识到你时间的价值。</p>
<p>While other people are spending their time mindlessly, wasting it on trivial pursuits, you will realize that you cannot do that, that time is really a valuable resource, and that you must use your time well. And you will not want other people to waste your time. This will help you in your re-evaluation of what you are doing and what you are giving yourself to in your life.</p>
<p>当其他人漫无目的地浪费他们的时间，将其浪费在琐碎的事情上时，你会意识到你不能这样做，时间真的是一种宝贵的资源，你必须好好利用你的时间。你不会希望他人浪费你的时间。这将帮助你重新评估你在做什么，以及你在生命中给予你自己的东西。</p>
<p>Time now becomes a kind of pressure, a beneficial pressure, as if it is reminding you that you have something important to do, and your time is important. As this emphasis on time increases, you will recognize that you have to organize your affairs. You have to be organized. You cannot be losing time over little mistakes and oversights. You cannot be reckless with your time, for time is important.</p>
<p>时间现在变成一种压力，一种有益的压力，好像它在提醒你，你有重要的事情要做，你的时间是重要的。随着对时间的重视程度不断增加，你会认识到你必须整理好你的事务。你必须有条理。你不能因为一些小错误和疏忽而浪费时间。你不能对时间掉以轻心，因为时间是重要的。</p>
<p>You will feel the need to become more organized, become more conscious of what you are doing, to use your time more effectively, to take the free time you have and direct it more purposefully, instead of letting it drift by. This will give you great vitality. This will challenge your weak habits and your weak tendencies.</p>
<p>你会感到有必要变得更加有条理，更加意识到自己在做什么，更有效地使用时间，把有限的空闲时间用得更有目的，而不是让它随意流逝。这将给你带来巨大的活力。它将挑战你的不良习惯和不良倾向。</p>
<p>You will not want anyone or anything to waste your time because you are trying to get somewhere. You have a destination. You have a rendezvous with other people whom you have not met. And though you cannot see this over the horizon, you are feeling the pull. Knowledge within you is now trying to get you somewhere. And this feeling of urgency is increasing, putting pressure on you, requiring you to organize your life and to be more conscious about what you choose to do, and who you choose to be with, and how you are to spend your time and your resources.</p>
<p>你不想让任何人或任何事浪费你的时间，因为你正试图到达某个地方。你有一个目的地。你要与其他未曾谋面的人会合。尽管你无法在地平线上看到这一点，但你正在感受到这种吸引力。你内在的内识正试图把你带到某个地方。这种紧迫感在不断增强，给你带来压力，要求你组织你的生命，更有意识地选择做什么，选择和谁在一起，以及如何花费你的时间和资源。</p>
<p>As your life begins to move towards its greater destination, the pull and the attraction of that destination will increase. Like a gravitational pull, it will become stronger. This, over time, will enable you to become single-minded. With this kind of focus, you will become more powerful, more determined and more resistant to seductions and persuasions around you, some of which captured you before and fixed your attention, but now they cannot penetrate your self-determination.</p>
<p>随着你的生命开始朝着更伟大的目的地前进时，这个目的地的牵引力和吸引力也会随之增强。就像引力一样，它会变得越来越强。随着时间的推移，这将使你变得更加专注。拥有这种专注力，你将变得更加强大、更加坚定，更能抵抗周围的诱惑和说服，其中一些诱惑和说服以前曾俘获了你并吸引了你的注意力，但现在它们无法再突破你自我决心的防线。</p>
<p>This is how addictions are escaped. This is how bad habits are overcome because you have something more important to do, and you are feeling the pull of this and the emphasis. Even if you make mistakes and fall back into old habits, you will spring back. You will feel the need to correct yourself, and it will be intense.</p>
<p>这就是摆脱成瘾的方法。这就是克服坏习惯的方法，因为你有更重要的事情要做，你感受到了这件事的吸引力和强调。即使你犯了错误，重新回到旧的习惯中，你也会重新振作起来。你会感到有必要纠正你自己，而且这种感觉会很强烈。</p>
<p>Other people around you who are still adrift, going with the flow, they will not understand you. They will not understand your seriousness. They will not understand why you are giving your focus to something so ineffable. They may even feel threatened by this, and they will certainly be confused.</p>
<p>你周围的其他人还在漂泊，随波逐流，他们不会理解你。他们不会理解你的严肃性。他们不会理解你为什么要把注意力放在如此难以言喻的事情上。他们甚至会因此感到威胁，当然也会感到困惑。</p>
<p>It is very important here that you not have detractors in your life—people pulling you back, holding you back, trying to keep you where they want you to be. You will have to leave many of these people, and some will just fall away because they cannot keep pace with you.</p>
<p>在这里，非常重要的一点是，你的生命中不能有诋毁者——那些拖你后腿、阻碍你前进、试图让你停留在他们希望你停留的地方的人。你必须离开许多这样的人，有些人会因为跟不上你的步伐而离开。</p>
<p>Something of the greatest importance is emerging in your life, and everything else becomes secondary to this. You will not abandon your young children here, but even their needs will become secondary to this because now you are experiencing the needs of God. Here you will not neglect your other duties in life, but your priorities will most certainly change.</p>
<p>最重要的内识正在你的生命中出现，其他一切都变得次要。在这里，你不会抛弃年幼的孩子，但即使是他们的需求也会变得次要，因为现在你正在体验上帝的需求。在这里，你不会忽视生命中的其他职责，但你的优先事项肯定会发生改变。</p>
<p>Ultimately, it becomes the pull of your destiny that draws you, that brings your life together, that enables you to follow one voice within your mind instead of many voices. This is what enables you to overcome conflict and self-disassociation. Here things that are meaningful within you become stronger, and things that are meaningless begin to be discerned and to fall away.</p>
<p>最终，它成为你天命的牵引力，吸引你，将你的生命凝聚在一起，使你能够听从心灵中的一个声音，而不是许多声音。这让你能够克服冲突和自我分裂。在这里，你内心有意义的内识会变得更加强大，而无意义的事物则开始被分辨出来并逐渐消失。</p>
<p>Like climbing a great mountain, you begin to shed things that are unnecessary that are adding to your weight and your burden. You readjust what you are carrying with you, and you find that others simply cannot climb this mountain. It is not their time. They do not feel the calling, and they do not have the strength.</p>
<p>就像攀登一座大山，你开始舍弃那些不必要的东西，它们只会加重你的负担和重量。你重新调整自己所携带的物品，你会发现其他人根本无法攀登这座山。现在不是他们的时间。他们没有感受到召唤，也没有足够的力量。</p>
<p>Here instead of trying to take your whole life with you, you realize you can only take a few things, and maybe a few people. And in some cases, you will have to travel alone—gaining strength, readjusting your burden, reestablishing your priorities.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再试图带走你的整个生命，而是意识到你只能带走一些东西，也许还有一些人。在某些情况下，你必须独自旅行——获得力量，重新调整你的负担，重新确定你的优先事项。</p>
<p>If you did not have a greater destiny and purpose in life, this would not happen. If you became fixated upon something, it would really be an obsession, a sign of weakness not strength. But the reality is that you do have a greater purpose, and already it is creating a draw upon you. Already you are feeling a deeper attraction. This is entirely natural and necessary, but it does not conform with your former plans, goals and understanding.</p>
<p>如果你在生命中没有一个更伟大的天命和目的，这种情况就不会发生。如果你执着于某件事情，那就真的是一种痴迷，是软弱而非坚强的表现。但现实是，你确实有一个更伟大的目的，它已经在吸引着你。你已经感受到了更深层次的吸引力。这完全是自然和必要的，但它不符合你之前的计划、目标和理解。</p>
<p>Here perhaps you will try to create a philosophy about what you are doing. Perhaps your intellect will try to keep up, trying to create new ideas, new structures of thought, new associations, to try to give meaning and substance to this mysterious pursuit. But in the end, you will have to face the mystery and admit to yourself that you do not know why you are doing what you are doing, but it is really important.</p>
<p>在这里，也许你会试图为你正在做的事情创造一种哲学。也许你的智力会努力跟上，试图创造新的想法、新的思维结构、新的联想，试图为这种神秘的追求赋予意义和实质。但最终，你必须面对这个神秘，承认你不知道你为什么要做你正在做的事情，但它确实是重要的。</p>
<p>Eventually, your intellect will have to come into service to the power of Spirit within you. It is here that your intellect will really begin to serve you in a beneficial way, instead of being a constant aggravation.</p>
<p>最终，你的智力必须服务于你内在的精神力量。正是在这里，你的智力才会真正开始以一种有益的方式为你服务，而不是不断地让你烦恼。</p>
<p>You are so blessed to be able to begin to experience the emergence of a greater purpose in your life. There are so many people in the world who are slaves to their circumstances, to poverty, to the dictates of a rigid culture. There are so many people who have no freedom to choose, or to alter their circumstances, or to redirect their lives.</p>
<p>你是如此被祝福，能够开始体验到生命中更伟大目的的出现。世界上有太多的人沦为环境的奴隶，沦为贫困的奴隶，沦为僵化文化的奴隶。有太多的人没有选择的自由，没有改变环境的自由，没有调整他们生命方向的自由。</p>
<p>They are bound because they are plagued by deprivation. They are overwhelmed by the needs of their families. They are held in place. They too have greater gifts to give to the world, but their circumstances will prevent them—many of them, most of them—from ever finding this. They do not have favorable circumstances. They do not have a favorable environment for a greater purpose to emerge. And that is a great impediment.</p>
<p>他们被束缚，因为他们饱受匮乏之苦。他们被家庭的需求压得喘不过气来。他们被束缚在原地。他们也有更伟大的礼物可以给予这个世界，但是他们的环境将阻止他们——他们中的许多人，他们中的大多数人——发现这一点。他们没有良好的环境。他们没有一个良好的环境让一个更伟大的目的得以显现。这是一个巨大的阻碍。</p>
<p>Do not think that people are right where they need to be, perfectly placed, for once you enter this world, you enter the chaos of this world. And your circumstances and your environment are very important in determining if and when greater opportunities will come to you.</p>
<p>不要认为人们总是在需要他们的地方，处于完美的位置，因为一旦你进入这个世界，你就进入了这个世界的混乱之中。你所处的境遇和环境非常重要，决定着你是否以及何时会遇到更伟大的机会。</p>
<p>The oak tree sheds many seeds, but only one or two will become a new tree. It is not God’s intention that there should be so much failure here; it is the circumstances of the world.</p>
<p>橡树撒下许多种子，但只有一两颗能成为新树。它并不是上帝的意图让这里充满失败，而是世界的环境决定了这一切。</p>
<p>Your task is not to change those circumstances according to your ideas, but to respond to a greater calling and to prepare for a greater work; to bring your life into order, into a greater focus; to withdraw from your obsessions; to overcome your weakness and to invest in your strength; to prepare yourself for a greater destiny, which might be entirely different from your personal goals and ideas about your life. Yes, you are here to make a difference, but where that contribution is to be made and what the contribution is, is beyond your ideas and your beliefs.</p>
<p>你的任务不是按照你的想法去改变这些环境，而是回应一种更伟大的召唤，为一种更伟大的工作做好准备；使你的生命井然有序，更加专注；从你的执着中抽身；克服你的弱点，投资于你的力量；为更伟大的天命做好准备，这可能与你的个人目标和对生命的想法完全不同。是的，你在这里是为了有所作为，但贡献在哪里，贡献是什么，都超出了你的想法和信仰。</p>
<p>If you can submit to a greater power in your life; if you can yield to the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself; if your intellect is willing to be the servant instead of the master, then you really have an opportunity.</p>
<p>如果你可以顺从你生命中一种更伟大的力量；如果你能屈服于你内在内识的力量和存在；如果你的智力愿意成为仆人而不是主人，那时，你就真的有一个机会。</p>
<p>Cherish this opportunity. Do not take it for granted. There are so few people in the world who have this opportunity. Do not shrink from it. Do not resist it or wage war against it. Do not give it away to follow your friends, or to submit to the social requirements of your family or your culture, or you will put them before the Calling of God. For this mysterious movement in your life represents a greater Calling.</p>
<p>珍惜这个机会。不要把它视为理所当然。世界上拥有这个机会的人太少了。不要逃避它。不要抵制它或与它作斗争。不要为了追随朋友而放弃它，也不要为了服从家庭或文化的社会要求而放弃它，否则你会把它们置于上帝的召唤之前。因为你生命中的这种神秘运动代表着更伟大的召唤。</p>
<p>Your greatest responsibility in life is to Knowledge within yourself. It is really to God. But this responsibility is not to a belief, or a system of thought, or a set of ideas. It is not even really to a Teaching. It is to something more mysterious.</p>
<p>你生命中最大的责任是对你内在的内识的责任。它实际上是对上帝的责任。但这个责任不是对一个信仰、一个思想体系或一套想法的责任。它甚至不是对一个教导的责任。它是对一种更神秘的内识的责任。</p>
<p>How God calls you and what God calls you to do are mysterious. Do not assume that what you are doing is what God has called you to do. Do not think that the little mound you are standing on represents the real mountain of life that you must climb. Do not justify your circumstances or your behavior by thinking that you are fulfilling a greater destiny or that God has planted you here to do these things, for you are underestimating the real nature of your Calling here.</p>
<p>上帝如何召唤你，上帝召唤你做什么，都是神秘的。不要认为你正在做的事情就是上帝召唤你去做的事情。不要认为你所站的小山丘就是你必须攀登的生命的真正高山。不要认为你正在实现一个更伟大的天命、或者上帝安排你在这里做这些事情，以此来为你的境遇或你的行为辩解，因为你低估了你在这里的召唤的真正性质。</p>
<p>If you were really doing what you came here to do, you would feel a very deep contentment. And you would feel this contentment despite all the difficulties and obstacles that you may have to face in carrying out these activities. You would feel a deep contentment.</p>
<p>如果你真的在做你来这里要做的事情，你就会感到非常满足。尽管在开展这些活动的过程中可能会遇到各种困难和障碍，但你仍会感到这种满足。你会感到深深的满足。</p>
<p>Perhaps your mind would want other things. You would have fantasies and dreams of wealth and beauty and power, of being in relationship with beautiful people, of traveling to exotic places, of owning wonderful things. But really, deep down inside, your heart is content.</p>
<p>也许，你的心灵会想要其他事物。你会幻想和梦想财富、美貌和权力，梦想与美丽的人交往，梦想去异国他乡旅行，梦想拥有美好的事物。但实际上，在内心深处，你的心是满足的。</p>
<p>You are not experiencing the constant aggravation and restlessness that everyone around you is plagued with, and trying to fulfill through the acquisition of people and things, new sensations, pleasures, stimulation.</p>
<p>您不会像周围的每个人一样，感受到持续的焦虑和不安，也不会试图通过获得人和事物、新的感觉、快乐和刺激来满足自己。</p>
<p>When you are really engaged with your greater purpose in life, there is a deep contentment, despite whatever difficulties you might have to face. You are really in the right place, dealing with the right people, doing the things that you must do.</p>
<p>当你真正投入到你生命中更伟大的目的中时，无论你面临什么困难，你都会感到深深的满足。你真的在正确的位置，与正确的人打交道，做你必须做的事情。</p>
<p>This is a very different experience. It is rare in the world. And anyone who is experiencing it is like a light in the world, an inspiration to others. People will come to you because they are drawn to you. They want to know why you are feeling the way you are, what is it about you that is different, that draws them?</p>
<p>这是一种非常不同的体验。这在世界上是罕见的。任何经历过这种体验的人都像世界上的一盏明灯，激励着他人。人们会来找你，因为他们被你吸引。他们想知道你为什么会有这样的感觉，你有什么与众不同的地方吸引了他们？</p>
<p>But you have not found this contentment yet because you are in preparation. You are still making the journey from your old life into a new life. And you cannot take the old life with you. You cannot put a new life on top of an old life. You cannot simply redecorate your life. It is not like changing your clothes. It is not like putting on a costume. It is like going from one side of the canyon to the other. It is like sailing from one shore to another.</p>
<p>但你还没有找到这种满足，因为你还在准备中。你仍在从旧的生命迈向新生命的旅程中。你无法把旧的生命带走。你无法把新的生命放置在旧的生命之上。你不能简单地重新装饰你的生命。它不像换衣服。它不像穿上戏服。它就像从峡谷的一边走到另一边。它就像从一个海岸驶向另一个海岸。</p>
<p>You are in preparation. Look at your life like this, and it will make sense to you. It will give relevance to what you are doing and what you are attempting to do. It will show you what is valuable and what is not, and the difference between what looks good and what really is good.</p>
<p>你正在做准备。这样看待你的生命，你就会觉得生命是有意义。它将使你正在做的和试图做的事情具有相关性。它会告诉你什么是有价值的，什么是没有价值的，以及看起来好的事物和真正善的内识之间的区别。</p>
<p>You are trying to get somewhere, and others are trying to get to a rendezvous point to meet you. Some of them may not make it, but you still have to go there. You cannot be content and call your situation good, or think that you are right where you need to be because you are trying to get somewhere. And you cannot change this.</p>
<p>你正试图到达某个地方，而其他人也正试图到达集合点与你会合。他们中的一些人可能无法到达，但你仍然必须去那里。你不能满足于现状，说你的处境很好，或者认为你正努力到达某个地方，就认为你已经到达了该到达的地方。你无法改变这一点。</p>
<p>You can decide against it. You can refuse it. You can fall asleep by the side of the road. Or you may try other avenues. But you cannot change your destiny.</p>
<p>你可以反对它。你可以拒绝它。你可以在路边睡着。或者你可以尝试其他途径。但你无法改变你的天命。</p>
<p>Do not see this as a loss of freedom because the freedom to choose against your destiny is the freedom to be chaotic. It is the freedom to lose yourself. It is the freedom to become lost in the world. And what kind of freedom is that, but the freedom to harm yourself, the freedom to waste yourself and your life and your great opportunity for being in the world at this time?</p>
<p>不要将此视为自由的丧失，因为选择违背你天命的自由，就是选择混乱的自由。这是迷失你自己的自由。这是迷失于世界的自由。这是一种什么样的自由，是一种伤害你自己的自由，是一种浪费你自己和你生命的自由，是一种浪费你此时来到这个世界上的伟大机会的自由？</p>
<p>Your real freedom is to find and to fulfill your greater purpose here. This is what freedom really is. It is the freedom for something. Not just the freedom from something.</p>
<p>你真正的自由是在这里找到并实现你更伟大的目的。这才是真正的自由。它是为了内识的自由。而不仅仅是从某种事物中获得的自由。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change and to prepare humanity for the challenges and the opportunities of engaging with intelligent life in the universe. These are the two greatest events in human history, and you are here to be a part of this in a very unique and special way.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送了一条新的讯息，让人类为变革的巨浪做好准备，并为人类与宇宙中智能生命接触的挑战和机会做好准备。这是人类历史上最伟大的两件大事，而你来到这里，以一种非常独特和特别的方式参与其中。</p>
<p>Perhaps these two great events are beyond your awareness. Perhaps you have never concerned yourself with them. But they will change the world you live in, and they are connected to why you are here.</p>
<p>也许这两件大事已超出了你的觉知。也许你从未关注过它们。但它们将改变你所生活的世界，它们与你身处这个世界的原因息息相关。</p>
<p>You have not come into the world to live under normal circumstances, to live like your ancestors lived, to live a predictable life. You have come here at a time of great change and upheaval, a time of great difficulty, and yet a time of great opportunity for the human family. It is no accident you are here at these times, facing a world undergoing convulsive change and great difficulty.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界，不是为了在正常的环境下生活，不是为了像你们的祖先那样生活，不是为了过一种可预测的生命。你来到这个世界，正值巨变和动荡的时期，一个充满巨大困难的时期，但同时也是人类大家庭的伟大机会的时期。你在这个时间来到这里，面对一个正在经历剧烈变化和巨大困难的世界，它并不是偶然的。</p>
<p>You can imagine any role for yourself. You can dream about what you could do, be or have, but really you are sent into the world to make a contribution under these very circumstances—in the face of the Great Waves of change, and in the face of humanity’s emergence into a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>你可以为你自己想象任何角色。你可以梦想你能做什么、成为什么或拥有什么，但实际上，你被派到这个世界上，就是为了在这些情况下做出贡献——面对变革的巨浪，面对人类向宇宙智能生命大社区的迈进。</p>
<p>If you do not know the context for your life, how could you ever discern what your life is for, or where its meaning can be derived? If you create your own context for your life, that is just a fantasy. It has no foundation in reality.</p>
<p>如果你不知道你生命的背景，你怎么能分辨出你的生命是为了什么，或者它的意义在哪里？如果你为你自己的生命创造背景，那只是一种幻想。它没有现实基础。</p>
<p>You have a greater destiny. You did not invent this. You are sent into the world on a mission. You have a purpose for being here. There are certain people you must meet. There are certain places you must go. There are certain things you must understand. There are certain connections you must make with the world and the condition of the world. This is necessary.</p>
<p>你有一个更伟大的天命。这不是你发明的。你被派到这个世界上来是为了一个使命。你在这里的存在是为了一个目的。你必须遇见特定的人。你必须去特定的地方。你必须理解特定的事情。你必须与世界和世界的状况建立特定的联接。这是必要的。</p>
<p>Be grateful then. Your life really does have purpose, meaning and direction. Be grateful that you have been saved from a hopeless and empty attempt at fulfilling yourself, according to your fancies or your notions, or the beliefs of others. Be grateful that your life is really valuable, inherently. Be grateful that you have a greater purpose, and with that purpose a greater strength to face the Great Waves of change and to find true relationship and partnership in service to a greater purpose in the world. Over time, you will realize what a great blessing this is.</p>
<p>因此，要心怀感激。你的生命真的拥有目的、意义和方向。要心怀感激，你已经从按照你的幻想、你的观念或他人的信念来实现你自己的无望与空虚的尝试中被拯救出来。要心怀感激，你的生命是真正有价值的，与生俱来。要心怀感激，你拥有一个更伟大的目的，并且有了这个目的，你就拥有了一种更伟大的力量，去面对变革的巨浪，去发现与他人之间的真实的关系与伙伴关系，为了世界上更伟大的目的而服务。随着时间的推移，你将意识到这是一种多么伟大的祝福。</p>
