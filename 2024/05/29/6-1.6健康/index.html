<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on May 22, 1987 in San Franciso, CA<br>1987年5月22日，在加州圣弗朗西索(San Franciso, CA)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been endeavoring to encourage students of Knowledge to develop a high degree of health. Maintaining good health has some very important aspects, particularly for those of you who are developing Knowledge and feel that God has a purpose for you in your life. You see, the development of your health is very essential. We are sad when people neglect this as they undertake spiritual development because it limits their capacity for Knowledge and their effectiveness with other people. It is neglectful because your body is important in serving a higher purpose in this world. It is a fragile instrument that seems to require so much care. Part of the reason for this is that you do not take good care of it, and so it is always failing you and slowing you down.</p>
<p>我们一直在努力鼓励内识的学生发展高度的健康。保持良好的健康有一些非常重要的方面，特别是对于那些正在发展内识并感觉到上帝在你的生命中有一个目的的人。你看，你的健康发展是非常重要的。当人们在进行精神发展时忽视了这一点，我们很难过，因为这限制了他们学习内识的能力和对其他人的效力。它是一种忽视，因为你的身体在为这个世界的更高宗旨服务方面很重要。它是一个脆弱的仪器，似乎需要那么多的照顾。部分原因是你没有好好照顾它，所以它总是让你失望，让你变的缓慢。</p>
<p>You see bodies everywhere, so you take them for granted. Bodies are a problem. You have to feed them, house them and drag them around all day long. They are always demanding and always having aches and pains, having to go to doctors, having to wear clothes, having to stay warm and having to stay dry. You have to give the body all this attention.</p>
<p>你到处看到身体，所以你认为它们是理所当然的。身体是一个问题。你必须喂养它们，安置它们，整天拖着它们到处跑。它们总是有要求，总是有疼痛，必须去看医生，必须穿衣服，必须保持温暖，必须保持干燥。你必须给身体所有这些关注。</p>
<p>So when people discover that there is another aspect of themselves that is not the body, they tend to neglect their body because they are tired of taking care of it. It is like a child that never grows up. It is always demanding. It requires a great amount of energy. Besides, it is extremely confining, is it not, to carry this body around all day? Your Being would much prefer to fly out the window and go wherever it wants to go! There will be a time for that later, perhaps, but right now you have this delicate instrument to care for.</p>
<p>因此，当人们发现自己的另一面不是身体时，他们往往会忽视自己的身体，因为他们厌倦了对它的照顾。它就像一个永远不会长大的孩子。它总是要求很高。它需要大量的精力。此外，整天带着这个身体走来走去，也是非常局限的，不是吗？你的存在更愿意飞出窗外，去它想去的任何地方！”。也许以后会有这样的机会，但现在你有这个精密的仪器需要照顾。</p>
<p>People develop health for many reasons. Often they develop health because they do not want to be sick, but that is not a sufficient reason to give the attention needed. People want to develop health so that they can look good to other people. That is a very short-range perspective on the value of developing health. Others want to develop health because they see a real benefit. They wish to experience life more deeply, more effectively and more enjoyably. This is getting to the point, but there is something even beyond this.</p>
<p>人们发展健康有很多原因。通常他们发展健康是因为他们不想生病，但这并不是给予必要关注的充分理由。人们希望发展健康，以便他们在其他人面前看起来很好。这是对发展健康的价值的一个非常短视的观点。其他人想要发展健康是因为他们看到了真正的益处。他们希望更深入、更有效和更愉快地经历生命。这就是问题的关键所在，但还有比这更重要的原因。</p>
<p>You have a responsibility in being here, a responsibility that very few people have recalled into their memory. You did not just end up here, surrounded by all these other people who ended up here, not knowing what to do with yourself. No, you have come here for a purpose. You have gone to great lengths to enter the physical body—a painful and difficult journey it is.</p>
<p>你在这里有一种责任，这种责任很少有人能回忆起他们的记忆。你不只是在这里结束，被所有这些其他结束在这里的人所包围，不知道该如何对待自己。不，你来这里是有目的的。你费尽心思进入有形的身体——这是一段痛苦而艰难的旅程。</p>
<p>If you did not have a body, it would be very difficult for you to communicate with people. It would be very difficult for you to contribute directly to this world, which so deeply needs your abilities. It would be very difficult to communicate to your loved ones who are here. You would speak, but they would not hear you, or if they heard you, maybe they would turn their head or feel a strange sensation. But it is unlikely that they would actually hear you speaking to them, for they are too preoccupied with their own thoughts to hear anything beyond their own mind.</p>
<p>如果你没有身体，你将很难与人交流。你将很难直接为这个深深需要你能力的世界作出贡献。与你在这里的亲人沟通也会非常困难。你会说话，但他们不会听到你，或者如果他们能听到你，也许他们会转过头来或感到一种奇怪的感觉。但他们不太可能真正听到你对他们的所说的话语，因为他们太全神贯注于自己的想法，听不到自己思想以外的任何事情。</p>
<p>So you have this body. It is meant to be an asset to you. It deserves your careful and conscientious care because it is a gift. You had to wait a long time to come here. You cannot just enter the world at will. You have to wait in line. Very few people remember where they came from, so this all seems a little irrelevant and perhaps controversial.</p>
<p>所以你有这个身体。它注定是你的财富。它值得你仔细和认真的照顾，因为它是一份礼物。你必须等待很长时间才能来到这里。你不能随随便便进入这个世界。你必须排队等候。很少有人记得他们从哪里来，所以这一切似乎有点无关紧要，也许是有争议的。</p>
<p>You are here for a very short time to accomplish a specific task. If you do not accomplish it, you will simply have to go through the process all over again until you can recognize your purpose while you are in the world and complete it. Then you will not need to come back anymore. For those of you who are honest about your experience here, at some point you must come to realize that you really do not want to come back again, particularly if you learn to recognize where you are going and the freedom that it promises for you.</p>
<p>你在这里的时间很短，要完成一个特定的任务。如果你没有完成它，你将不得不重新经历这个过程，直到你能认出你在这个世界上的目的，并完成它。然后你就不需要再次来到这里。对于那些对自己在这里的经历诚实的人来说，在某些时候你必须认识到你真的不想再回来，特别是如果你学会认识到你要去的地方和它为你承诺的自由。</p>
<p>Developing health takes a level of concentration, self-discipline and commitment that anyone would benefit from having. It is not that health is so difficult to maintain. It is that very few people feel they are worth the effort. It is not their bodies that they are evaluating here. It is themselves.</p>
<p>发展健康需要一定程度的专注、自律和承诺，任何人都会从中受益。这并不是说健康是如此难以维持。而是很少有人觉得自己值得付出这样的努力。他们在这里评估的不是他们的身体。而是他们自己。</p>
<p>If you have no sense of abiding purpose in your life, then you will feel that your body is just one more nuisance to you. But as you cultivate your awareness of your purpose, and as it becomes more real as a guiding force that you feel each day, then you must realize that your physical body is a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>如果你对你的生命没有持久的目的感，那么你会觉得你的身体对你来说只是一个麻烦。但是，当你培养你对目的的意识时，当它作为你每天感受到的指导力量变得更加真实时，那么你必须意识到你的物质身体是一个非凡的的成就。</p>
<p>You have a great opportunity if you are not short sighted and if you think about your life in a long-term sense. Once you see that you are a visitor in this world and that this is not your home, then perhaps you will begin to recognize you have a responsibility to those who have sent you to realize your purpose, to develop the necessary skills and to take good care of your physical vehicle. If you take good care of your physical body, it will serve you well and meet the demands that you place upon it. Indeed, as your purpose is realized, you will discover that your life will become increasingly focused, and you will have greater demands upon your energy. They will be regenerative demands; they will be beneficial to you, but you must be physically capable.</p>
<p>如果你不目光短浅，如果你从长期的意义上思考你的生命，你就有一个伟大的机会。一旦你看到你是这个世界的访客，这里不是你的家，那么也许你会开始认识到你对那些派你来的人有责任，要实现你的目的，发展必要的技能，好好照顾你的身体载体。如果你好好照顾你的物质身体，它将很好地服务于你，并满足你对它的要求。事实上，随着你对目的的认识，你会发现你的生命将变得越来越集中，你将对你的能量有更大的要求。它们将是再生的要求；它们将对你有益，但你必须有身体上的能力。</p>
<p>Now you all have Inner Teachers, but if your body is a dull instrument, it will prevent you from responding. Your body needs to be keen. It needs to be an asset. If it is cared for, it is like a window and not a wall. You will be able to look through it, and it will not prevent you from receiving more directly the communication that you need to receive from God.</p>
<p>现在你们都有内在的老师，但如果你的身体是一个沉闷的工具，它将阻止你做出反应。你的身体需要敏锐。它需要成为一种资产。如果它得到照顾，它就像一扇窗户而不是一堵墙。你将能够透过它看，它不会妨碍你更直接地接收你需要从上帝那里收到的沟通。</p>
<p>It is true that many people hide within their bodies. From a personal standpoint, this is one of the reasons for having a body. It is a place to hide so no one can see you. All they can see is your fortress. They cannot even see you. They cannot find you. If they took your fortress and they opened it up, like surgeons do, they still could not find you. If they took it apart in tiny little squares, they still could not find you. The body is a great hiding place. No one can find you.</p>
<p>的确，许多人躲在自己的身体里。从个人的角度来看，这也是拥有身体的原因之一。它是一个隐藏的地方，所以没有人可以看到你。他们所能看到的是你的堡垒。他们甚至无法看到你。他们无法找到你。如果他们把你的堡垒打开，像外科医生那样，他们仍然找不到你。如果他们把它切成很小的方块，他们仍然找不到你。身体是一个很好的藏身之处。没有人能够找到你。</p>
<p>But as the body becomes purified, it literally becomes transparent. You are able to see out of it and people are able to see into it. Now it becomes an asset to communication and not an obstacle. It is only when the body becomes empty, clear and clean that the mind will have a greater access to what is calling to it.</p>
<p>但是随着身体的净化，它实际上变得透明。你能够看到它的外面，人们能够看到它的里面。现在它成为沟通的资产，而不是障碍。只有当身体变得空虚、清晰和干净时，心灵才会有更多的机会接触到召唤它的内识。</p>
<p>If you say, “I want to develop health,” and you do this only from a personal standpoint, it is unlikely that you will have enough interest to do it. But if you experience that God wants you to do it and humanity needs you to do it, that would make a very great difference. This is greater than a personal interest in health. Your body now needs to be developed. It needs to be an adequate vehicle and instrument for you to use. Then you will have sufficient motivation, and you can take on the change and the initial discomforts that are required, whatever they may be.</p>
<p>如果你说：”我想发展健康，”而你只是从个人的角度去做，你不可能有足够的兴趣去做。但是，如果你经历到上帝要你做这件事，人类需要你做这件事，它将会带来非常大的不同。这比个人对健康的兴趣更大。你的身体现在需要被开发。它需要成为一个适当的载体和工具供你使用。然后你将有足够的动力，你可以承担改变和最初需要的不适，无论它们是什么。</p>
<p>It would be a shame if your body failed you, leaving your purpose undone. Bodies are very fallible and breakable. People attribute magical powers to bodies, but they are really not very magical. They are simply machines. They are beautiful mechanisms, and if they break beyond a certain point, you will not be able to repair them. So do not use your body with negligence, thinking, “Well, if I wear it out or if it falls apart, God will come along and fix it up for me.” This vehicle of communication is a gift.</p>
<p>如果你的身体辜负了你，让你的目的无法实现，那将是一种耻辱。身体是非常易变和易碎的。人们把神奇的力量赋予身体，但它们其实并不神奇。它们只是机器。它们是美丽的机械装置，如果它们破损超过一定程度，你将无法修复它们。所以，不要粗心大意地使用你的身体，想着”好吧，如果我把它损坏了，或者它散架了，上帝会来帮我修好它”。这个沟通的载体是一件礼物。</p>
<p>In your own Knowledge, you know you have to do certain things. We are not speaking of extremes. We are saying that you know your body needs to be healthy. It is part of your Knowledge that knows that this is true, and any reason you give to excuse yourself will not prevail against Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>在你自己的内识中，你知道你必须做某些事情。我们不是在说极端的事情。我们是说，你知道你的身体需要健康。它是你内识的一部分，它知道这是真的，你给出的任何理由为自己开脱，都不会战胜内识本身。</p>
<p>As We said, if your body is neglected and does not function properly, then it will be an obstruction and a problem to you. It will slow you down and interfere. It will dull your mind. It will not be what it is intended to be.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，如果你的身体被忽视，不能正常运作，那么它将成为你的障碍和问题。它将会拖累你，干扰你。它将使你的心智变得迟钝。它不会成为它所要成为的载体。</p>
<p>As your body becomes more efficient in its functioning, you will be able to devote yourself to developing your deeper abilities. The body now is no longer a constant adversary. It is simply a useful instrument. It does not matter if it is beautiful or not. That is not the point. What matters is that it functions properly so that you can be in it comfortably and use it for a good purpose.</p>
<p>当你的身体在运作中变得更有效率时，你将能够投入到发展你更深层的能力。现在身体不再是一个持续的对手。它只是一个有用的工具。它是否美丽并不重要。这不是问题的关键。重要的是它的功能正常，使你能在其中舒适地生活，并为一个好的目的使用它。</p>
<p>It takes some discipline, commitment and consistent self-application to develop your physical vehicle. It takes the same intent to develop your mental abilities.</p>
<p>发展你的物质载体需要一些纪律、承诺和持续的自我应用。发展你的心理能力也需要同样的意图。</p>
<p>You see, progress in this world is actually being furthered by a very small percentage of the population who are doing all the work for everyone else. Maybe twenty percent of your population is doing all the work. They are really breaking new ground. Everyone else is working, but they are not breaking new ground.</p>
<p>你看，这个世界的进步实际上是由很少一部分人在推动的，他们在为其他人做所有的工作。也许你们百分之二十的人口正在做所有的工作。他们真的在开辟新的天地。其他人都在工作，但他们没有开创新的局面。</p>
<p>We give this perspective not to condemn you at all, but in relation to your neighbors in the Greater Community, your people are extremely lazy and ineffective. This is partly due to the fact that your environment is so easy and requires so little. This is quite rare in the Greater Community, where in order to survive and maintain their development, races have had to cultivate themselves. It is not a matter of “Do I really want to or not?” It is simply necessary. Here it is not necessary because everything is so easy.</p>
<p>我们提出这个观点，根本不是要谴责你，而是相对于你们大社区的邻居而言，你们的人是极其懒惰和无效的。这部分是由于你们的环境是如此简单，要求如此之低。这在大社区是相当罕见的，为了生存和维持发展，种族不得不自我培养。它不是一个”我真的想不想”的问题。它只是必须。在这里，它不是必要的，因为一切都很容易。</p>
<p>This world is an ideal little place. Compared to other worlds in the Greater Community, this world is a gem. Of course, because no one has an understanding of this, most people will spoil this gem.</p>
<p>这个世界是一个理想的小地方。与大社区的其他世界相比，这个世界是一颗宝石。当然，由于没有人对此有所理解，大多数人都会糟蹋这颗宝石。</p>
<p>People often ask God for very great things. They wish to know their purpose, their future or the outcome of their involvements. Yet they are not able to carry out what these things would really require of them because they do not have enough energy or vitality.</p>
<p>人们经常向上帝要求非常伟大的事情。他们希望知道他们的目的，他们的未来或他们参与的结果。然而他们却无法执行这些事情对他们的真正要求，因为他们没有足够的能量或活力。</p>
<p>You see, as you develop Knowledge and your mind becomes more refined, it becomes more focused and has greater concentration. Your physical body is then able to exercise greater energy, and it is able to accomplish more.</p>
<p>你看，随着你内识的发展，你的心智变得更加精炼，它变得更加聚焦，有更大的集中。然后你的身体就能发挥更大的能量，它就能完成更多的任务。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must be able to conserve your efforts. Your body must be able to act upon the incentive of the mind. That is why people who are really going to do something important in this world are very single minded. They are not constantly being swept away by all the pleasurable inducements around them. If they partake of these inducements, it is only to a limited degree because they need their resources. They cannot squander their time or energy on things not directly relevant to their central area of concentration. They must be physically and mentally able, and to the degree to which they are, they are demonstrating health, for their minds and bodies are now able to serve their intention.</p>
<p>因此，你必须能够保存你的努力。你的身体必须能够在心灵的激励下采取行动。这就是为什么那些真正要在这个世界上做一些重要事情的人是一心一意的。他们不会不断地被周围所有令人愉快的诱因所吸引。如果他们参与这些诱因，也只是在有限的程度上，因为他们需要自己的资源。他们不能把时间或能量浪费在与他们的中心领域没有直接关系的事情上。他们必须在身体和心理上有能力，而且在他们有能力的程度上，他们正在展示健康，因为他们的心灵和身体现在能够为他们的意图服务。</p>
<p>That is why We wish to recommend a very moderate development of physical health because this will enable your body to express more profound things. It will allow your mind to become more direct, more acute, more sensitive, more aware and more able to respond. Your mind will then become a sensitive instrument. Then when there is something important happening, you will be able to respond. Your body then will not be a great weight upon you, a great burden.</p>
<p>这就是为什么我们希望推荐非常适度的身体健康发展，因为这将使你的身体能够表达更深刻的事情。它将使你的心变得更直接、更敏锐、更敏感、更有意识和更能做出反应。然后你的心智将成为一个敏感的工具。然后当有重要的事情发生时，你将能够做出反应。这样，你的身体就不会成为你的重担，不会成为你沉重的负担。</p>
<p>This body is always an object of your concern: “I have to change it. I have to do this or that to it.” What a waste of your time to always be working on a body. By the time you finally get it where you want it to be, if you ever do, it will be time to give it up.</p>
<p>这个身体总是你关注的对象：”我必须改变它。我必须对它做这样或那样的事情”。总是在一个身体上工作是多么浪费你的时间。当你最终把它放在你想要的地方时，如果你真的做到了，那就是放弃它的时候了。</p>
<p>You are not here to work on a body. You are simply asked not to damage it so that you can accomplish something of importance here. Then when you leave this world, you will know you have accomplished your purpose successfully. Not only will you be successful as a result, but the others who are depending upon you and who need you to make your contribution here will be successful as well.</p>
<p>你在这里不是为身体工作的。你只是被要求不要损坏它，以便你能在这里完成一些重要的事情。然后当你离开这个世界时，你会知道你已经成功地完成了你的目的。不仅你会因此而成功，而且那些依赖你、需要你在这里做出贡献的其他人也会成功。</p>
<p>The fundamental understanding is the realization that you are already part of something that is established. The world does not demonstrate this, so you must know it within yourself. Knowing this, you realize you have a responsibility to a community that exists already. This responsibility is what will encourage and empower you to do great things in the world.</p>
<p>重要的理解是认识到你已经是既定关系的一部分。世界并没有证明这一点，所以你必须在自己的内心知道它。知道了这一点，你就意识到你对已经存在的社区有责任。这种责任将鼓励你并授权你在这个世界上做伟大的事情。</p>
<p>People do not do great things for personal interests. Personal interests are not strong enough to lead to great acts and important contributions or to lead people beyond ordinary things to the important things that can elevate your whole race.</p>
<p>人们不会为了个人利益而做大事。个人利益不够强大，不足以导致伟大的行为和重要的贡献，也不足以带领人们超越平凡的日常，去做能够提升整个民族的重要事情。</p>
<p>People are very depressed because they do not have any vitality. They have no sense of purpose, no sense of being. They blame their bodies because their bodies are always hurting them, and they blame their environment because their environment is always obstructing them. But the problem is that they do not experience their own vitality. They are not experiencing life. They are bogged down within themselves and are not with life.</p>
<p>人们非常郁闷，因为他们没有任何活力。他们没有目的感，没有存在感。他们责备自己的身体，因为他们的身体总是在伤害他们，他们责备自己的环境，因为他们的环境总是在阻挠他们。但问题是，他们没有经历到自己的生命。他们没有经历到生命。他们在自己的内心深处陷入困境，没有与生命在一起。</p>
<p>Being with life is so essential. It is why you have come here. Because when you are with life, you will know what to do in order to serve it and you will be able to receive its tremendous gifts as well. Here you are valuing something that is not temporary, and you are valuing the temporary for serving something that is not temporary. Your body is something temporary that serves something eternal. That is when you realize your responsibility to maintain it, to care for it and to use it properly.</p>
<p>与生命在一起是非常重要的。它也是你来到这里的原因。因为当你与生命在一起时，你将知道如何做才能为它服务，你也将能够收到它惊人的礼物。在这里，你看重的是非暂时的内识，你看重的是为非暂时内识服务的暂时的身体。你的身体是暂时的载体，为永恒的内识服务。这时你会认识到你有责任维护它，照顾它，正确地使用它。</p>
<p>It is difficult to do this in your current society because your environment is always encouraging you to hurt your physical body, to misuse it and neglect it, as if doing so leads to greater enjoyment. Only your suffering must persuade you to the contrary. Abuse does not lead to enjoyment and does not increase your vitality.</p>
<p>在当前的社会中，你很难做到这一点，因为你所处的环境总是在鼓励你伤害自己的身体，滥用它，忽视它，似乎这样做会带来更大的享受。只有你的痛苦才能说服你，让你明白相反的道理。虐待不会带来享受，也不会增强你的活力。</p>
<p>Your vitality will make every day essential to you regardless of what is going on around you or how you feel. Whether you have a good day or a bad day, today is still very meaningful. Today is another opportunity to develop yourself and to contribute to your world. It is this sense of vitality that overrides all of the small objections that affect most people so much. You are not held back by little things when you are involved in something great.</p>
<p>你的活力会使每一天对你来说都是必不可少的，不管你周围发生了什么，也不管你的感觉如何。无论你有一个好日子或坏日子，今天仍然是非常有意义的。今天是另一个发展自己和为你的世界作出贡献的机会。正是这种充满活力的感觉压倒了所有影响大多数人小小的反对意见。当你参与到伟大的事情中时，你不会被小事所牵绊。</p>
<p>One of the reasons war is created in this world is because it is far more exciting than peaceful living here. You notice when peaceful times exist, society starts to degenerate, and then there is a big war. Everyone then gets a tremendous sense of temporary purpose and vitality. When war is finally over with terrible destruction, people enjoy peace for a few years, and then there is a new war.</p>
<p>战争在这个世界上产生的原因之一是，它比这里的和平生活要刺激得多。你注意到当和平年代存在时，社会开始堕落，然后就有了一场巨大的战争。然后每个人都会得到一种巨大的临时目的和活力的感觉。当战争最终以可怕的破坏结束时，人们享受了几年的和平，然后又有了新的战争。</p>
<p>Everyone talks about peace on the planet, but there are very few people who could tolerate it. There are very few people who could live in a world of peace. They are ill prepared. You have left a world of peace to come into this world. Peace is possible here, but you must prepare yourself for it. You cannot be living in conflict and hope to have a world of peace. The bullets will still fly and nations will still assault one another.</p>
<p>每个人都在谈论地球上的和平，但很少有人能容忍它。能够生活在和平世界中的人非常少。他们准备不足。你已经离开了一个和平的世界，来到这个世界。和平在这里是可能的，但你必须为它做好准备。你不能生活在冲突中而希望有一个和平的世界。子弹仍然会飞，国家仍然会互相攻击。</p>
<p>No one can tolerate peace for long because if your environment is peaceful, your anger begins to come forth. If your environment is not peaceful, you do not realize your own anger. If you were in a room with no stimulation at all, a very peaceful room with no aggravation, your own anger would come forth. You would realize that you are at war already. You are struggling against your own Knowledge. You are fighting with yourself. That is why there is not peace in the world. There is only peace to the extent that people can tolerate it. So you will not have peace in the next decade because people cannot tolerate it. If the world were without conflict, it would be like the little room with very little stimulation.</p>
<p>没有人能够长期容忍和平，因为如果你的环境是和平的，你的愤怒就会开始涌现。如果你的环境不和平，你就意识不到自己的愤怒。如果你在一个完全没有刺激的房间里，一个非常和平的房间，没有任何的刺激，你自己的愤怒就会涌现出来。你会意识到你已经处在战争之中。你正在与你自己的内识作斗争。你在与自己争斗。这就是为什么世界上没有和平。只有在人们能够容忍的范围内才有和平。所以你在未来的十年不会有和平，因为人们不能容忍它。如果世界上没有冲突，它就像呆在一个刺激很小的小房间里。</p>
<p>To the mind that is cultivated, the room without stimulation is a wonderful place. To the mind that is in conflict, the room without stimulation is a terrible place. To the mind that has been refined, the silence of the wilderness is a wonderful experience to be cherished. To the mind in conflict, it is an aggravation.</p>
<p>对于得到滋养的心灵来说，没有刺激的房间是一个美妙的地方。对处于冲突中的心灵来说，没有刺激的房间是一个可怕的地方。对已经滋养的心灵来说，荒野的寂静是一段值得珍惜的美妙经历。对处于冲突中的心灵来说，它是一个加重的地方。</p>
<p>You have two things to accomplish, which are quite essential to your being here. You cannot neglect them, regardless of your beliefs or point of view. You must develop yourself, your inherent abilities, and you must contribute something vital to the world. Your own Being knows this even if your thoughts do not account for it. Your own Being will be aggravated until it can accomplish these two things, which together comprise your purpose.</p>
<p>你有两件事要完成，这对你在这里是相当重要的。你不能忽视它们，不管你的信仰或观点如何。你必须发展你自己，发展你固有的能力，你必须为这个世界做出一些重要的贡献。你自己的存在知道这一点，即使你的想法没有说明这一点。你自己的存在会恶化，直到它能完成这两件事，这两件事共同构成了你的目的。</p>
<p>We have spoken of the physical body, but that is only one aspect of health because if your mind is at war, it will not want a healthy body. Why? Because the body will be like the silent room and will be an aggravation. The silent room is very boring to the mind in conflict. It cannot tolerate it. Yet as you begin to value inner peace more and more, you will seek for quiet. You will want your body to be quiet. You will not want it constantly complaining. You will want the quiet room. You will want a peaceful world. Why? Because in the quietness you experience God, and all that is meaningful returns to you.</p>
<p>我们已经谈到了物质的身体，但这只是健康的一个方面，因为如果你的心灵处于战争状态，它就不会想要一个健康的身体。为什么？因为身体会像沉默的房间一样，会成为一个加重的问题。沉默的房间对处于冲突中的心灵来说是非常无聊的。它不能容忍它。然而，当你开始越来越重视内心的平静，你会寻求安静。你会希望你的身体是安静的。你将不希望它不断抱怨。你会想要安静的房间。你会想要一个和平的世界。为什么？因为在静默中你会经历到上帝，所有有意义的关系都会回到你身边。</p>
<p>Consider the body as a room. It is either loud and clashing, or it is quiet and empty. A quiet and empty room is a wonderful gift to the mind that appreciates it, a wonderful sanctuary. It functions in its capacity without complaint. Then when it is time for you to leave this world, you will thank your body for being a gracious temporary dwelling.</p>
<p>把身体看成是一个房间。它要么是喧闹和冲突，要么是安静和空虚。一个安静而空旷的房间对欣赏它的心灵来说是一份美妙的礼物，一个美妙的避难所。它在自己的能力范围内运作，毫无怨言。然后当你离开这个世界的时候，你会感谢你的身体成为一个亲切的临时住所。</p>
<p>To spend your life struggling with your body is really very wasteful. You will reflect upon this once you leave. Here is an analogy: It is as if you wake up in the morning and you cannot decide what to wear. You spend the whole day going through your wardrobe and then it is nighttime, but you did not even go out at all, and the day is gone. Put something on and go out!</p>
<p>把你的生命花在与你的身体斗争上真的是非常浪费。一旦你离开，你会反思这一点。这里有一个比喻。就像你早上醒来，你无法决定穿什么。你花了一整天的时间翻阅你的衣柜，然后到了晚上，但你甚至根本没有出门，这一天就这样过去了。穿上衣服就出发吧!</p>
<p>People only love their bodies when their bodies serve a higher purpose. To love your body for any other reason is simply to use it for selfish reasons, which will breed resentment. Your body must enable you to extend your sense of relationship in life. If it does not do this, it is a prison. It is holding you back and shutting you in. And your mind will still feel trapped.</p>
<p>人们只有在身体为更高宗旨服务时才会爱自己的身体。出于任何其他原因而爱你的身体，只是为了自私的原因而使用它，它将滋生怨恨。你的身体必须使你能够扩展你在生命中的关系感。如果它不能做到这一点，它就是一个监狱。它在牵制着你，把你关在里面。而你的心智仍然会感受到限制。</p>
<p>You do not want your body to be a problem. You want it to be an asset. You know this already. You know that your body needs to function properly, and you know what you need to do. It is not for vanity’s sake that you do this. It is simply that part of your vehicle in this world, which is your body, is slowing you down. Even a crippled person can use the body effectively. Even a blind person can use the body effectively. That is not such a great liability. It is the use of the body that matters.</p>
<p>你不想要你的身体成为一个问题。你想要它成为一种资产。你已经知道这一点。你知道你的身体需要正常运作，你也知道你需要做什么。你这样做不是为了虚荣心。只是你在这个世界上载体的一部分，也就是你的身体，正在拖累着你。即使是一个残废的人也能有效地使用身体。甚至一个盲人也能有效地使用身体。这并不是什么大的责任。重要的是身体的使用。</p>
<p>What this means in actuality is you must be very conscientious about what you eat. You must be conscientious about sexual engagements. You must be very conscientious about where you take your body and how you expose it to the environment. It will take less energy to maintain health than it does to damage your body. If your lifestyle is based upon neglect, then it is hard for you to realize how much energy you are wasting on your neglect.</p>
<p>这实际上意味着你必须非常认真地对待你的饮食。你必须认真对待性的参与。你必须非常认真地对待你的身体，以及你如何将它暴露在环境中。保持健康所需的能量要比损害你身体所需的能量少。如果你的生活方式是建立在忽视的基础上，那么你很难认识到你在忽视上浪费了多少能量。</p>
<p>In the development of Knowledge, the mind is discovering its true Source and its true Self. As this proceeds, you become increasingly sensitive, even in your physical body, and you naturally steer yourself away from environments that are disruptive or that hinder your abilities. Likewise, you will become increasingly intolerant of foods that are counter-productive to your well-being.</p>
<p>在内识的发展中，心灵正在发现其真实的来源和真实的自我。随着这一过程的进行，你会变得越来越敏感，甚至在你的物质身体中也是如此，你自然会引导自己远离那些具有破坏性或阻碍你能力的环境。同样，你会变得越来越不耐烦那些对你的健康有反作用的食物。</p>
<p>You do not need to have very interesting beliefs about this. It is a natural process of change. You are now becoming pragmatic about your body. You simply want it to work properly, and that becomes the criteria for any changes you might make in your habits. You have to do this with very little agreement from your world because your world does not value these things.</p>
<p>你不需要对此有非常有趣的信仰。它是一个自然的改变过程。你现在对你的身体变得很务实。你只是希望它能正常工作，这就成为你在习惯上可能做出的任何改变的标准。你必须在你的世界很少同意的情况下做到这一点，因为你的世界并不重视这些事情。</p>
<p>You live in a society that is very tolerant, regardless of your complaints. Compared to the Greater Community, it is extremely lenient. This has its assets and its liabilities. Its assets are that your society fosters a freedom of expression and exploration that has produced great things. Its liability, however, is that its population is weak, self-indulgent and incapable of responding to change very effectively.</p>
<p>你生活在一个非常宽容的社会里，不管你有什么抱怨。与大社区相比，它是非常宽松的。这有它的资产和负债。它的优点是，你们的社会促进了表达和探索的自由，产生了伟大的关系。然而，它的责任是，它的人民是软弱的，自我放纵的，没有能力非常有效地应对改变。</p>
<p>Any society has possibilities and obstacles. This is the environment you must work within. It is not an environment that fosters dedication particularly. It is an environment that may give freedom of discovery though it does not foster the ability necessary to make your discovery effective.</p>
<p>任何社会都有可能性和障碍。这就是你必须在其中工作的环境。它不是一个特别能培养奉献精神的环境。它是一个可以给予发现自由的环境，尽管它不会培养让你的发现变得有效所必需的能力。</p>
<p>The mental equivalent of developing health is that your mind becomes focused on its primary purpose. All of its conflicts with itself—its wants and its interests—now begin to fall away because its predominant emphasis is taking over. You have something very important to do, and other things do not matter so much.</p>
<p>发展健康心理的等价物是你的心灵变得聚焦于其主要目的。它与自己的所有冲突——它的愿望和利益——现在开始消失，因为它的主要重点正在被接管。你有非常重要的事情要做，而其他事情就不再那么重要了。</p>
<p>What happens to you physically here is that you simply want your body to serve you. You do not want to serve it. It becomes a servant and not a master to you. Those of you who have not acquired a functioning level of health are servants to your body. It is governing and limiting you unnecessarily.</p>
<p>在这里，你身体上发生的事情是，你只是想让你的身体为你服务。你不想为它服务。它成了你的仆人，而不是主人。那些还没有获得正常健康水平的人是你身体的仆人。它在不必要地支配和限制着你。</p>
<p>Health is natural. You do not need to be spectacular physically and run over mountains and swim across great distances. That is for acrobats and exhibitionists. You only need to be able to adequately complete each day without any obstruction from your physical body and to be able to live your span of life here in this world in health, longevity and accomplishment.</p>
<p>健康是自然的。你不需要有惊人的体能，不需要翻山越岭，不需要游历千山万水。那是杂技演员和表演艺术家的事。你只需要能够不受身体的任何阻碍，充分地完成每一天的工作，能够在这个世界上健康的、长寿的、满足地度过你的一生。</p>
<p>It is a remarkable aspect of human evolution that grave circumstances are created to promote advancement. This is in fact a common feature of the physical universe. Has it not been curious to you that as your life becomes easier, you lose vitality? This is worth considering because if you honestly look at this without preference and without trying to justify things that you might want, it allows you to look and ask, “What is really important here? If I become wealthy and have comforts, will that produce greater vitality for me?” Vitality is health.</p>
<p>人类进化的一个显著方面是，创造严重的环境来促进进步。这实际上是物理宇宙的一个共同特征。难道你不好奇吗，当你的生活变得更容易时，你会失去活力？这是值得考虑的，因为如果你诚实地看待这个问题，没有偏好，没有试图证明你可能想要的东西，它允许你看一看并问：”这里真正重要的是什么？如果我变得富有，拥有舒适的生活，这是否会给我带来更大的活力？”活力就是健康。</p>
<p>People want to have greater security in the world. Does that produce greater vitality? People want to fulfill their “want” list to make sure they get all the things that they are demanding from life. They are demanding a perfect relationship, a beautiful body and good employment. They are demanding that God show up whenever they want. Does that produce vitality? If you become a very wealthy person and your children grow up in wealth, does that produce vitality for them?</p>
<p>人们希望在这个世界上有更大的安全感。这是否会产生更大的活力？人们想要实现他们的”需求”清单，以确保他们得到他们从生活中要求的所有物品。他们要求有一个完美的关系，一具美丽的身体和一份良好的就业。他们要求上帝随时出现在他们想要的地方。它能产生活力吗？如果你成为一个非常富有的人，你的孩子在财富中成长，这是否为他们产生了活力？</p>
<p>These are important questions because they allow you to look at life more objectively. Ask yourself, “What produces the greatest vitality? Do I need to have war in order to give myself a temporary sense of purpose and determination? Do I have to let my physical health become so denigrated that I finally have conviction regarding its improvement? Do I have to let my relationships become so intolerable before I am willing to be responsible for what I know?”</p>
<p>这些问题很重要，因为它们使你能够更客观地看待生命。问问自己，”什么能产生最大的活力？我是否需要有战争，以便给自己一个暂时的目标和决心？我必须让我的身体健康变得如此被诋毁，以至于我最终对它的改善有了信念吗？难道我必须让我的人际关系变得如此难以忍受，我才愿意对我所知道的事情负责吗？”</p>
<p>Vitality is the issue. When We speak of health, We speak of vitality. You can have a beautiful body, run over mountains and have no vitality at all but be a dead person in a handsome body. Or you can be an unspectacular looking person and be absolutely radiant. Why radiant? Because you are experiencing life. And you are radiant no matter what is going on because everything counts: the good things which are rewards and the bad things which are opportunities. If you make your life too easy, you will not apply yourself and will become depressed. So why make life easy? Why not make life more vital? Easy is not better. The only value in ease is that it gives you the freedom to involve yourself in something that produces greater vitality.</p>
<p>活力是问题所在。当我们谈论健康时，我们谈论的是活力。你可以有一个漂亮的身体，爬山越岭，完全没有活力，但在英俊的身体里却是一个死人。或者你可以是一个不引人注目的人，但绝对是光芒四射。为什么光芒四射？因为你正在经历生命。无论发生什么事，你都是光彩照人的，因为一切都很重要：好的事情是奖励，坏的事情是机会。如果你让你的生活太容易了，你就不会运用你自己，会变得很沮丧。那么，为什么要让生活变得简单？为什么不使生命更有活力？容易并不是更好。轻松的唯一价值在于它让你有自由去参与产生更大活力的事情。</p>
<p>We are at work all the time. We do not take days off and go on holiday. You would be in trouble if We did! For Us, there is no separation between work and play because Our work creates vitality. People consider work to be something that robs them of vitality, and so they go rest, which does not give them much vitality either. They do not know what vitality is.</p>
<p>我们无时无刻不在工作。我们不放假，也不度假。如果我们这样做，你就会有麻烦！对我们来说，工作和娱乐之间没有分别，因为我们的工作创造了活力。人们认为工作是剥夺他们活力的原因，所以他们去休息，这也没有给他们带来多少活力。他们不知道活力是什么。</p>
<p>You do not have to have magical or mystical experiences or go to great heights or have beautiful visions to have vitality. That is not vitality. Vitality is tapping into your own Knowledge and allowing it to express itself through you. It is tapping into the divine vibrant force within you and allowing it to express itself into life through your physical vehicle.</p>
<p>你不需要有神奇的经历或神秘的经历，或者去到很高的地方，或拥有美妙的愿景来拥有活力。那不是活力。活力是挖掘你自己的内识，并允许它通过你表达自己。它是挖掘你内在神圣的活力力量，并允许它通过你的物质载体表达自己的生命。</p>
<p>Let Us now take a moment of quiet together. Let Us for a moment allow Our bodies to be the quiet room, the room without stimulation, in order that We may feel the content of life, the Presence of life that is God. Let this body that conceals you be your sanctuary of prayer, a holy place.</p>
<p>让我们现在一起安静一小会儿。让我们暂时让身体成为一个安静的房间，一个没有刺激的房间，以便我们可以感受到生命的内容，生命的存在，也就是上帝。让这个隐藏着你的身体成为你祈祷的圣地，一个神圣的地方。</p>
