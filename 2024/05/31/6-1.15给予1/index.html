<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on December 4, 1987 in San Francisco, CA<br>1987年12月4日，在加州旧金山(San Francisco, CA)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would like you to think about giving in the sense of what has been given to you. Each of you has come from your Spiritual Family into this world to play your part in this era of human evolution. You have come with problems to solve, but more importantly you have come bringing the memory of your Ancient Home here, so that the distinction between the world and the Ancient Home from which you have come will lessen and disappear in time.</p>
<p>我们希望你能从已经给予你们的意义上考虑给予。你们每个人都从你们的精神家庭来到这个世界，在这个人类进化的时期中扮演你们的角色。你们带着要解决的问题而来，但更重要的是，你们带着对你们古老家园的记忆来到了这里，这样，世界和你们所来自的古老家园之间的区别将随着时间的推移而减少和消失。</p>
<p>You see, only those who know that they have come from their Ancient Home can give. If you do not know you have a Home beyond the world, how can you give? You are bereft. You are poor. Poverty is your state even if you have money, drive cars and live in luxury. The sense of poverty is your companion.</p>
<p>你看，只有那些知道自己来自古老家园的人才能给予。如果你不知道你有一个家在世界之外，你怎么能给予？你是被抛弃的。你是贫穷的。贫穷是你的状态，即使你很有钱，开着名贵的跑车，生活在奢华之中。贫穷的感觉也陪伴着你。</p>
<p>Since everyone here has come from this place bearing gifts for the world, everyone shares a common heritage. Everyone is in a state of evolution. Everyone is moving towards something. Life here is moving towards something. Everything in the universe is moving—planets, stars, galaxies—all moving towards something.</p>
<p>因为这里的每个人都来自这个地方，给世界带来了礼物，所以每个人都拥有共同的遗产。每个人都处于进化的状态。每个人都在朝着某个目标前进。这里的生命正朝着某个方向前进。宇宙中的一切都在运动——行星、恒星、星系——都正在向某物进行着运动。</p>
<p>You have all come from the same place. You are all returning to the same place. But you are following different ways and using different means. Now that you have come into the world, there is great assistance available to you. There is tremendous assistance, my God! It has taken a great deal of planning to get you this far. You have come from your Spiritual Family. Thus, you are a representative of your Family while you are in the world. The world is a lonely, poor place. Therefore, it is important that you who come bearing gifts not only feel that you should give or that you must give, but realize the extent to which you are given to.</p>
<p>你们都来自同一个地方。你们都将返回到同一个地方。但你们遵循不同的方式，使用不同的途径。现在你已经来到这个世界，有极大的援助可以提供给你。有巨大的援助，我的上帝！让你走到这一步，是经过大量的计划。你已经从你的精神家庭而来。因此，当你在这个世界上时，你是你家庭的代表。这个世界是一个孤独和贫穷的地方。因此，重要的是，带着礼物来的你不仅要觉得你应该给予或必须给予，而且要意识到你被给予的程度。</p>
<p>You see, when you are not tyrannized by your own thoughts, you begin to feel the spiritual Presence that is with you, the Presence of your Spiritual Family. You can feel their Presence here. So powerful is their Presence. If you persist in your development, then not only will you feel it, you will receive it, and it will move within you. It is a very great process. Very powerful.</p>
<p>你看，当你不被自己的心智所支配时，你开始感觉到与你同在的精神存在，你精神家庭的存在。你可以在这里感受到他们的存在。他们的存在是如此强大。如果你坚持你的发展，那么你不仅会感觉到它，你会收到它，它将在你体内流动。它是一个非常伟大的过程。非常强大。</p>
<p>In studying The Way of Knowledge, people learn to become disengaged from their own thoughts so that they can enter the realm of pure experience. Along the way, they learn to refine their perception, develop their sensitivity and organize their thinking. All this happens as a result of giving.</p>
<p>在学习内识的道路上，人们学会脱离自己的心智，以便进入纯粹的经验领域。在这一过程中，他们学会了完善自己的感知，发展自己的敏感度，组织自己的思维。所有这些都是由于给予而发生的。</p>
<p>You Inner Teachers are here to give. You do not have anything here that they need. They do not need cars or money, holidays or vacations. They do not need a trip around the world. They can go around the world anytime. Like that! They can be at the far side of the world in the next moment. So it is not that they need what the world possesses, but you do have something that they need. What they need is for you to give what they gave to you when you came here.</p>
<p>你内在的老师在这里是为了给予。在你们这里没有他们所需要的任何东西。他们不需要汽车或金钱，不需要假期或度假。他们也不需要环游世界的旅行。他们可以随时环游世界。就像这样！他们可以在下一刻就来到世界的另一端。因此，并不是他们需要这个世界上所拥有的东西，但你确实有他们需要的东西。他们需要的是你给他们在你来到这里时给你的东西。</p>
<p>You see, you need your Inner Teachers very much, but they need you as well. It is a perfect complementary relationship. You could not be successful in your development in this world if you did not have your Teachers with you. The world would consume you completely. You would be lost here with little hope of regaining any memory of your true existence. It is because of your Inner Teachers and because of your true nature that this is not the case.</p>
<p>你看，你非常需要你的内在老师，但他们也需要你。这是一种完美的互补关系。如果没有老师和你在一起，你在这个世界上的发展就不可能成功。这个世界会完全吞噬你。你会在这里迷失，几乎没有希望找回你真实存在的记忆。正是因为有你的内在老师，因为你的真实本性，情况才不会如此。</p>
<p>Giving has many ideas associated with it, and some of them are not helpful. First, it is very important for you to realize that you do not know what you have to give. It is not what you think. Intentional giving often leaves you bereft and empty. It leaves you weaker and more depleted than you were before.</p>
<p>给予有许多与之相关的想法，其中有一些是没有帮助的。首先，非常重要的是你要意识到，你不知道你要给予什么。它不是你所想的那样。有意的给予往往会让你感到失落和空虚。它会让你比以前更虚弱、更疲惫。</p>
<p>It is not you who does the giving. It is your Knowledge that does the giving through you. Something moves in you that gives. This is the true source of giving. It is your life that gives. It is not you. What can you give? You have a little money, a few possessions, a little bit of time, a little bit of love, a little bit of compassion. Yes, you can give these things beneficially, but you have too little.</p>
<p>给予的不是你。是你的内识通过你给予。在你的里面有某种力量在给予。这就是给予的真实来源。是你的生命在给予。它不是你。你能给予什么？你有一点钱，一些财产，一点时间，一点爱，一点同情心。是的，你可以有益地给予这些东西，但你所拥有的实在太少了。</p>
<p>It is something in you that gives and feeds others physically, spiritually and emotionally. As a result, you become more powerful, stronger and healthier. Why? Because your Knowledge gives where it must give, and it gives to the right people in the right circumstances in the right way. And you, as a medium of the giving, benefit because you receive the gift as well. Here giving is a spontaneous and natural exercise.</p>
<p>它是在你的身体上、精神上和情感上给予和哺育他人的东西。结果是，你变得更有力量，更强壮，更健康。为什么？因为你的内识在它必须给予的地方给予，并在正确的情况下以正确的方式给予正确的人。而你，作为给予的媒介，也会受益，因为你也会收到礼物。在这里，给予是一种自发和自然的行为。</p>
<p>Can you take your spirit and make it give something? Now you can give ideas, thoughts, emotions and beliefs, and these can be helpful, but there is a greater giving that gives you. This is very important because many of you feel you must give more than you want to. This creates conflict and then you think, “Well, if I give, I will get more. If I give what I want, I will get what I want.” And there are all of these ideas about giving that are nothing more than bargaining. “Well, I will give a little bit here and a little bit there.”</p>
<p>你能带着你的精神，让它给予一些东西吗？现在你可以给予想法、思想、情感和信仰，这些都是有帮助的，但还有一个更伟大的给予会给你。这一点非常重要，因为你们中的许多人觉得你必须给予比你想要的更多。这使他产生了冲突，然后你会想：“好吧，如果我给予，我就会得到更多。如果我给予我想要的，我就会得到我想要的“。所有这些关于给予的想法，都不过是在讨价还价。”好吧，我会在这里给予这一点，我会在那里给予另一点。“</p>
<p>That is not the giving We speak of. What We speak of is Knowledge emerging and expressing itself within you. It is the power of your true Being, and at some point it gives you. Something takes over inside, and it is so natural and so gracious. You find yourself saying something or doing something that you never would have planned to say or do. Afterwards, you say, “My God! What have I said? What have I done?” It is as if life pulled it out of you.</p>
<p>这不是我们所说的给予。我们所说的是内识在你里面的出现和表达。它是你真实存在的力量，在某些时候它会给你力量。有些东西在你里面占据了位置，它是如此自然，如此亲切。你发现自己说了一些话或做了一些你从未打算说或做的事。事后，你会说，”我的上帝！我刚才说了什么？我做了什么？”就好像生命把它从你身上拉出来一样。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are not the giver. You are the medium of the giving. This is a very important difference. Those individuals whom you honor for their great contributions in the holy days, did they figure out what they wanted to give? No. Did they figure out how they would do it? No. They gave a lot because they gave more than they had planned to give because their Knowledge did the giving.</p>
<p>因此，你不是给予者。你是给予的媒介。这是一个非常重要的区别。那些在神圣的日子里做出巨大贡献的人，他们是否想出了他们想要给予的东西？他们是否想好了应该怎么做？他们给予了很多，因为他们给予的比他们计划的更多，因为是他们的内识进行了给予。</p>
<p>When Knowledge gives, everyone is at ease. There is no guilt or blame because you did not give enough in that situation. “Oh, I should have helped that person, but you know, I really did not want to,” or “I should go see this person, but you know, I really don’t want to.” And there is terrible blame for not even wanting to because you think you are supposed to.</p>
<p>当内识给予时，每个人都很轻松。没有罪恶感或责备，因为你在那种情况下没有给予足够的帮助。”哦，我应该帮助那个人，但你知道，你真的不想。”或者”我应该去看这个人，但你知道，你真的不想。”而且，如果你认为你应该这样做，甚至不想这么做，你就会受到严重的指责。</p>
<p>You do not go Home because you are supposed to. You did not come into the world because you were supposed to. There is no “supposed to” in the universe. That is not what moves things. The Earth turns not because it is supposed to. Does it have a choice in the matter? Is it not moved by something greater? And is not your giving moved by something greater as well?</p>
<p>你回家不是因为你应该回家。你来到这个世界不是因为你应该来到。宇亩中没有所谓的“应该”。这不是推动事物的原因。地球的自转并不是因为它应该自转。它在这个问题上有选择吗？难道它没有被更强大的力量所推动吗？而你的给予不也是被更伟大的力量所推动吗？</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge teaches people to receive their greatness. Then Knowledge can move them more powerfully. Then there is less obstruction. There is less in the way. There is less refusal. There is less indecision. There is less preference. That is why this Teaching is so mysterious. It is not philosophical in nature. There is not a whole new philosophy of giving.</p>
<p>大社区的内识之路教导人们接受他们的伟大。然后，内识可以更有力地推动他们。这样就减少了障碍物。减少了阻碍。有了更少的拒绝。更少的犹豫不决。更少的偏好。这就是为什么这个教导是如此的神秘。它在本质上不是哲学性的。也并不存在一种全新的给予哲学。</p>
<p>So how do you do this mysterious kind of giving that We are talking about? You have to prepare. That is essential. That is what distinguishes the true initiates from the pretenders. Those who are willing to prepare in a curriculum that they did not invent for themselves are the ones who will surpass their previous capacity. The training has already been prepared and is established. It is given in many different forms, and it always takes you on a path that you would not have taken yourself. It asks you to receive something you could not give yourself, and in time it will ask you to give something you did not know you had. You will discern the power of the universe working within you, and it will not occur to you to ask questions about God, eternity, happiness, peace and evolution. You will merely be a witness to the movement of things. Indeed, you will be the movement of things.</p>
<p>那么，你是如何进行这种神秘的给予呢？你必须做好准备。这是至关重要的。这将区分真正的启蒙者和伪装者。那些愿意在一个并非他们自己创造的课程中做好准备的人，才能超越他们先前的能力。培训已经准备好并确立。它以许多不同的形式呈现，总是引导你走一条你自己不会选择的道路。它要求你接受你自己无法给予的东西，并最终会要求你付出你自己不知道拥有的东西。你将辨别到宇宙的力量在你内在运作，而你不会想到去问有关上帝、永恒、幸福、和平以及进化的问题。你只会成为宇宙运动的见证者。事实上，你将成为宇宙的运动。</p>
<p>Why is a holy person so powerful? Because they are the movement. They have prepared long for this. It is not something that came along one day and swept them away. They prepared mentally, emotionally and physically. Why? Because this is the realm of preparation. You do not prepare Knowledge; you prepare your body and your mind to be vehicles for Knowledge.</p>
<p>为什么一个圣洁的人如此强大？因为他们就是运动。他们已经为此准备了许久。它不是在某天出现的力量，然后就把它们一扫而空。他们在心理上、情感上和身体上都做好了准备。为什么？因为这就是准备的领域。你不是在准备内识；你是在准备你的身体和心智，使之成为内识的载体。</p>
<p>We would like to talk about spiritual practice here because it is relevant to giving. When you practice, whether it be a meditation in any form or an exercise in writing or observation, it is quite important that you enter practice with the idea of giving yourself to it. What can you get from practice? If getting is your motive, you will not have the patience, the openness or the receptivity that are necessary to receive the benefits.</p>
<p>我们想在这里谈谈关于精神练习，因为它与给予有关。当你练习时，无论是任何形式的冥想，还是写作或观察的练习，相当重要的是，进入练习时带着全身心投入的想法是相当重要的。你能从练习中得到什么？如果你得到的是你的动机，你就不会有耐心，敞开或接受的态度是获得成效所必需的。</p>
<p>If you close your eyes in meditation and you say, “I want to have contact with the Teachers. I want to have this question answered. I want to have certainty about this issue. I want to have a high experience. I want to leave my current circumstances and feel wonderful. I want, I want, I want.” Then of course you do not find anything. So there is disappointment immediately, and then you say, “Well, maybe if I give up all wants, I will get what I want,” and so it goes on and on.</p>
<p>如果你在冥想中闭上眼睛，你说：”我想和老师接触。我想得到这个问题的答案。我想对这个问题有确定性。我想要有一个丰富的经历。我想离开我目前的处境，感受美好。我想要，我希望，我需要。”当然，你没有找到任何东西。所以马上就有了失望，然后你说，”好吧，也许如果我放弃所有想要的东西，我就会得到我想要的东西。”就这样，它一直持续下去。</p>
<p>But, you see, when you practice in meditation, you come to give yourself to it, and there is a response because your Teachers come to give themselves and that is the touch. That is where you touch each other. They give to you, you give to them, and you share your mutual giving. People often think in meditation that there are all of these realms and levels, but you know, there is only relationship there. Whatever experience you have, it is because you are joining your mind with another mind in some way. Realms and all that do not matter. Relationship matters; intimacy matters.</p>
<p>但是，你看，当你在冥想的练习中时，你将自己投入其中，你会得到一个回应，因为你的老师来给予他们自己，那就是触碰。那是你们互相接触的地方。他们给予你，你给予他们，你们分享你们之间的相互的给予。人们在冥想中常常认为有所有这些境界和层级，但你知道，在那里只有关系。无论你有什么经历，都是因为你以某种方式将你的心与另一个心连接在一起。境界和所有这些层级并不重要。关系是重要的；亲密的关系也是重要的。</p>
<p>This is what generates Knowledge. This is what returns the memory of your Ancient Home to you so that you can be an emissary while you are here because that is why you came. Why else would you have come here? It is too difficult a place to go on vacation. You are not here simply to repair old mistakes. There is not enough incentive for that.</p>
<p>这就是产生内识的原因。这就是把你的古老家园的记忆还给你的原因，以便你能够在这里的时候成为一位使者，因为这就是你来的原因。否则你为什么会来到这里？它是一个非常困难的地方，并不适合进行度假。你来到这里并不是为了弥补过去的错误。也没有足够的动力使你来做这件事。</p>
<p>Many of you already know that you should do this and that you should not do that. It is not merely that someone told you. You know what is not good for you, but you do it anyway. You should not eat these foods; they do not make you feel good. Every time you see this person or go to that place, it is not good for you. You know that, but you do it anyway. Why is that? Wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume that if you saw something that would be to your advantage, you would seize upon it without delay? When you are truly motivated, this happens.</p>
<p>你们中的许多人已经知道，你们应该做这个，不应该做那个。这不仅仅是有人告诉你。你知道什么对你不利，但你还是做了。你不应该吃这些食物；它们不会让你感觉良好。当你每次看到这个人或去那个地方，都对你没有好处。你知道这一点，但你还是这么做了。这是为什么呢？如果你看到对你有利的东西，你会毫不迟疑地抓住它，这难道不是合理的假设吗？当你有真正的动力的时候，这种情况就会发生。</p>
<p>Why is there this ambivalence about Knowledge, this ambivalence about relationship, this ambivalence about intimacy? Perhaps one way of looking at this is that if you think you are going to cultivate yourself for yourself alone, there is not enough reason to do it. After all, life is short. You might as well have a good time. You are not too sure of what is waiting for you on the other side.</p>
<p>为什么对内识会有这种矛盾心理，对关系有这种矛盾心理，对亲密关系有这种矛盾心理？也许可以这样看待这个问题：如果你认为你要独自培养自己，那么就没有足够的理由这么做。毕竟，生命是短暂的。你还不如好好享受一下。你并不太确定另一边有什么正在等待着你。</p>
<p>People generally cultivate themselves because they realize their value to the world. Why else would they go through all of this development, exert this effort, expend their energy and make these little sacrifices unless they realized that they were important to the world? It is too difficult for people who are merely self-indulgent to prepare. It is too great for personal aims.</p>
<p>人们之所以培养自己，通常是因为他们意识到了自己对世界的价值。否则他们为什么要经历所有这些发展，付出这些努力，消耗他们的精力，做出这些小小的栖牲，除非他们意识到他们对世界是重要的？对那些仅仅是自我放纵的人来说，准备工作将显得太困难。对个人的目标来说，它太大了。</p>
<p>It does not take a lot of people to keep Knowledge alive in the world. Only a fairly small number who respond completely can keep it aglow here. Their lives are Knowledge. Though they are people with personal problems and personal thoughts and concerns, a Greater Power now abides within them. It is evident. They as individuals must develop themselves to carry this Presence, for one must be very wise to carry this Presence in the world. You must be purified and cleansed, and your mind must be whole. You cannot have conflicting impulses and will. Your behavior must express this wholeness.</p>
<p>世界上不需要许多人就能让内识保持活力。唯有相当少的人完全回应，才能在这里保持它的活力。他们的生活就是内识。虽然他们是有个人问题、个人思想和关切的人，但现在有一种更伟大的力量存在于他们之中。这是显而易见的。他们作为个人必须发展自己来承载这种临在，因为一个人必须非常明智才能在世界中承载这种临在。你必须被净化和清洁，你的心智必须是完整的。你不能有相互冲突的冲动和意志。你的行为必须表达这种整体性。</p>
<p>Knowledge is very powerful. It has a tremendous effect upon others. You cannot be idealistic about it. If you render this Presence to those who do not want it, you give them only three choices: They can join you, escape from you or attack you. They have no other choice. They will hardly be indifferent. You are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>内识是非常强大的。它对其他人有巨大的影响。你不能对它抱有理想主义。如果你把这种临在呈现给那些不想要它的人，你只会给他们三个选择：他们可以加入你，逃离你或攻击你。他们没有其他选择。他们不会无动于衷。因为你是一股不可忽视的力量。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must develop so that your giving is done with wisdom. This maintains you and assures that your giving will occur in the right place with the right individuals. That is why people who are destined to receive their Spiritual Family will go through a long period of development, which to them will seem to be for other reasons. You think that you study, think about things and read books so that you can become a better person. No, no, no. Life does not need a better person. It simply moves you into a position so that at some point you can experience the Presence that is with you in such a way that you will have a window into your Ancient Home. All of this personal growth, what is it for? It merely moves you into position where you can experience Knowledge. That is its only value.</p>
<p>因此，你必须发展，以便你的给予是以智慧来完成的。这将维持你，并保证你的给予会在正确的地方与正确的人发生。这就是为什么注定要接受他们精神家庭的人将经历一个漫长的发展期，对他们来说，这似乎是出于其他的原因。你认为你学习，思考问题，阅读书籍，以便你能成为一个更好的人。不，不是的，不是这样的。生命不需要一个更好的人。它只是将你移动到一个位置，以便在某一时刻你能以这样的方式经历与你同在的临在，你将拥有一扇通往你古老家园的窗户。所有这些个人成长，它是为了什么？它只是把你移动到你可以经历到内识的位置上。这是它唯一的价值。</p>
<p>Your Teachers are given to you so that you may learn to give to the world. That is happiness here. Happiness here is knowing you are at Home while you are here. The only remnant of your Ancient Home is your giving which comes from Knowledge, which gives itself when you are ready. You do not need to badger yourself thinking, “I must give more. I must give more. I must give more.” Your Inner Teachers do not do that. You do not need to do that either. But at certain times, you will be moved to give, and these times are important. It is not obligation or guilt. It is something else. It is entirely natural.</p>
<p>你的老师给予你，使你可以学习给予这个世界。这就是这里的幸福。在这里，幸福就是当你在这里的时候，知道你在家。你古老家园唯一剩余的是你的给予，它来自内识，当你准备好的时候，它就会给予自己。你不必纠缠于自己的想法，”我必须给予更多。我必须付出更多的努力。我必须付出更多的代价。”你的内在老师不会这样做。你也不需要这样做。但在某些时刻，你会被推动去给予，而这些时刻是很重要的。它不是义务或内疚。它是别的东西。它是完全自然的。</p>
<p>First, you must prepare, and your preparation is all about giving yourself. When you meditate, give yourself. Your Teachers will only show up if they think it is important. You cannot reel them in. Insights will come to you when you are ready. They do not come upon demand. Thoughts are not insights. Knowledge is not thought in the way that you think of it. When you study your behavior or your thinking, and when you read about the lives of others who are inspiring to you, give yourself to that. It is all about giving. Then there is a great opening in you. It is so natural, it almost escapes your attention.</p>
<p>首先，你必须做好准备，而你的准备都是关于给予自己的。当你冥想时，要给予自己。你的老师只会在他们认为重要的时候才会出现。你不能把他们拉进来。当你准备好的时候，洞察力就会向你走来。它们不是应要求而来。想法不是洞察力。内识并不是以你所认为的方式来思考的。当你研究你的行为或思维时，当你阅读那些激励你的人的生活时，把自己投入进去。这都是关于给予。然后在你身上就会有一个巨大的开口。它是如此自然，它几乎逃过了你的注意。</p>
<p>If this giving is allowed to continue, and you become a person of impeccable character, then the giving can happen with little risk to you personally and with great advantage to others. You will be the witness of a miraculous event inside yourself. Do not think that Jesus Christ was not marveling at his own work! It is a marvel to see that your life is a vessel for a greater gift.</p>
<p>如果这种给予被允许继续下去，你就会成为一个品格无可挑剔的人，那么这种给予可以在对你个人没有什么风险的情况下发生，而对其他人却有很大的好处。你将成为自己内心神奇事件的见证者。不要认为耶稣基督没有对他自己的工作感到惊奇！看到你的生命是一个更伟大礼物的容器，它是一个奇迹。</p>
<p>Artists, musicians and athletes must train at their skill. They must practice a long time. Practice, practice. What is their reward? Their reward is that, for those moments in which their skill is in full employment, they are feeling a greater force moving in them. It is almost like they are going along for the ride. They are beyond effort and beyond anxiety. They are swept up. Their vehicle has been prepared, and so now they can transcend its mechanism. It is a very total experience in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>艺术家、音乐家和运动员必须对他们的技能进行训练。他们必须长时间的练习。练习，再练习。他们的回报是什么？他们的回报是，在他们的技能得到充分运用的那些时刻，他们感觉到一种更大的力量在他们身上运动。这几乎就像他们是在随波逐流。他们超越了努力，超越了焦虑。他们被卷入。他们的交通工具已经准备好了，所以现在他们可以超越它的机制。它是在一个很短的时间内的一次非常全面的经历。</p>
<p>When you leave this world, you go back to your Ancient Home and you meet your group. You look and you ask, “Well, did I give it all? Are my bags empty? Did I deliver everything?” If your bags are not empty, you will want to come back. No one will order you back. You will say, “My God! Why did I not see it? It is so obvious to me now! I am Home. It is so obvious! Why was I such a miserable person? I was only there for a few years. It seems like yesterday that I was with you all. Well, I want to go back. When can I do it?” And you find out you have to wait a little while.</p>
<p>当你离开这个世界时，你回到你的古老家园，你遇到你的团体。你看了看，然后问：”好吧，我是否给予了一切？我的包裹是空的吗？我是否给予了我的一切？”如果你的包裹不是空的，你会想要回来。没有人会命令你回来。你会说：”我的上帝！我为什么没有看到呢？现在对我来说是如此的明显!我回家了。它是显而易见的！为什么我是一个如此悲惨的人？我在那里只待了几年。我和你们大家在一起仿佛就好像在昨天。好吧，我想回去。我什么时候才可以这样做？”然后你发现你必须等待一段时间。</p>
<p>It is so obvious what needs to be done. What needs to be done is you need to be the person in the world that you are when you are in your Ancient Home. That is what needs to be done. Once that is accomplished, you will not need to come here because then you will be able to give like your Inner Teachers. You see, the world is like a garden. It is tended by gardeners. Your minds are the soil and the seeds of wisdom are planted. We cultivate this garden because there are only minds cultivating minds.</p>
<p>需要做的事情是如此明显。需要做的是，你需要成为你在你古老家园时在世界上的那个人。这就是需要做的事。一旦完成了这一点，你就不需要再次来到这里，因为那时你将能够像你的内在老师那样给予。你看，世界就像一个花园。它是由园丁所照料的。你们的心灵是土壤，智慧的种子被种下。我们培育着这个花园，因为只有心灵才能孕育心灵。</p>
<p>Therefore, you do not need to become a saint. You do not need to emulate behavior or force yourself to give what you do not want to give. That is not the preparation. It is difficult for students of Knowledge to fully appreciate the importance of their specific day-to-day development. They are preparing for a great opening inside themselves where their Ancient Home reveals and expresses itself through them. For that moment, they are Home, and they are an extension of Home in the world, where those who are Homeless come.</p>
<p>因此，你不需要成为一个圣人。你不需要模仿行为，也不需要强迫自己给予你不愿意给予的东西。这不是准备。内识的学生很难完全理解他们特定的日常发展的重要性。他们正在为自己内部的巨大开放进行准备，在那里他们的古老家园通过他们来揭示和表达自己。在那一刻，他们就是家，是这个世界上无家可归者的家，世界之外家的延伸。</p>
<p>Life is so short, why meditate? You are only here for a few years, then you get sent back like a returned package. Why spend all this time practicing? You must do it because it is your nature to give. You were made to give. You are the gift. Without giving, life is miserable.</p>
<p>生命是如此短暂，为什么要冥想？你只能在这里待几年，然后你就会像一个被退回的包裹一样被送回来。为什么要花这么多时间来进行练习？你必须这样做，因为给予是你的本性。你是为了给予而生的。你就是礼物。没有给予，生命是悲惨的。</p>
<p>Yes, each of you has needs and at times you need a great deal, but it is only to enable you to give. This is so clear if you ever have contact with your Inner Teachers because all they do is give. And they ask you to do things at a point in time so that you can experience giving, and they can share their joy with you.</p>
<p>是的，你们每个人都有需要，有时你们需要很多，但这只是为了使你们能够给予。如果你曾经与你的内在老师接触过，这一点就会非常清晰，因为他们所做的一切都是为了给予。他们要求你在某个时间点做一些事情，以便你能够经历给予，他们也能与你分享他们的喜悦。</p>
<p>The great individuals, what did they accumulate here? Only one thing and that is relationship. When they left, whether they were penniless or rich, what did they take Home with them? They took relationship.</p>
<p>那些伟大的个人，他们在这里积累了什么？只有一件事，那就是关系。当他们离开时，无论他们是身无分文还是富有，他们把什么带回了家？他们带回了关系。</p>
<p>You see, if your life is about contribution, you will not have a problem finding people to be with you. Your problem will be choosing the right people to be with. You will not have to worry about a good career. Life bends itself to those who give, so thirsty for giving is life here. If the Presence is with you, people will come to you like magnetism. That is why you must be a person with little or no personal ambition. You must be very clean, but it is not you who cleanses yourself. Knowledge cleanses you.</p>
<p>你看，如果你的生命是关于贡献的，你就会很容易找到和你在一起的人。你的问题将是选择正确的人与你在一起。你将不必担心一个好的事业。生命会向那些给予者倾斜，所以这里的生命渴求给予。如果存在与你同在，人们会像被磁力一样吸引来到你的身边。这就是为什么你必须是一个很少或没有个人野心的人。你必须非常洁净，但净化自己的不是你。是内识使你变得纯净。</p>
<p>The world is a very tough place to give in because people are ambivalent about getting well. There is a great deal of harshness and anger here. So how do you give in situations like that? How do you give to people who are angry, resentful and unhappy? How do you give where giving seems prohibitive? How do you give to situations that seem dangerous or violent? There are many “how to” questions about giving, and they are quite legitimate, but the answer is very simple though it will be a little mysterious: Do not worry about it. What gives through you knows how, when and where to give because you are not the person giving. You are the person following.</p>
<p>这个世界是一个非常难以让步的地方，因为人们对康复的态度是矛盾的。这里有大量的严厉和愤怒。那么，你如何在这样的情况下给予？你如何向那些愤怒、怨恨和不快乐的人给予？在给予看起来非常令人望而却步的地方，你将如何给予？你如何应对那些看起来危险或暴力的情况下进行给予？关于给予有许多”如何”的问题，它们是相当合理的，但答案是非常简单的，尽管会有点神秘：不要担心它。通过你给予的内识知道如何给予、何时给予、何地进行给予，因为你不是那个给予的人。你是那个跟随的人。</p>
<p>You must all become followers. It is very curious that in human societies, being a follower seems so belittling. Being a follower is something that people look down on. “Oh, you’re a follower? What is wrong with you?” Everyone is supposed to be a leader and in command—a captain or general or admiral or leader of a corporation or master artist. Being a follower is something pathetic here.</p>
<p>你们都必须成为追随者。非常奇怪的是，在人类社会中，作为一位追随者似乎很受到轻视。做一位追随者是人们看不起的事情。”哦，你是一个追随者呀？你有什么问题吗？”每个人都应该是一位领导者和指挥者——船长或将军或海军上将或公司的领导者或艺术大师。作为一位追随者，在这里似乎是很可悲的事情。</p>
<p>You must all become followers because you all are followers. There are no leaders in the world. Those who appear to be leaders are either following Knowledge, or they are following their ambitions. They are bound to what they follow. There is no freedom except in choosing and in following the right calling.</p>
<p>你们都必须成为追随者，因为你们都是追随者。世界上没有领导人。那些看起来是领导者的人要么是在跟随内识，要么是在跟随他们的野心。他们被他们所跟随的东西所束缚。除了选择和跟随正确的召唤，没有任何自由可言。</p>
<p>To be a real student, you must be a follower because to be a real student means that you are learning things you have never learned before. You are entering territory of which you know little, and you must entrust yourself to your guide or instructor. You cannot lead the way. If you try to teach yourself, you will only recirculate old information. You will walk around the same territory, imagining you are making great strides, and after many breakthroughs, you will end up in the same place. “Well, here I am again!” Therefore, you must be a follower.</p>
<p>要成为一名真正的学生，你必须是一位追随者，因为成为一名真正的学生意味着你正在学习你以前从未学过的东西。你正在进入你知之甚少的领域，你必须把自己托付给你的向导或指导者。你不能领路。如果你试图教你自己，你只会重复旧的信息。你会在同样的领域中徘徊，想象着自己正在取得巨大的进步，而在多次突破之后，你会在同一个地方结束。”好吧，我再次回来了！”因此，你必须成为一位追随者。</p>
<p>The great recipients of Knowledge, those who are leaders, their lives are bound to Knowledge. They are following it. They are given to it. They are directed by it. They are nourished by it.</p>
<p>那些伟大的内识接受者，那些领导者，他们的生命与内识紧密相连。他们正在追随它。他们被赋予它。他们被它引导。他们被它所滋养。</p>
<p>What can you give away in life but your independence? Is freedom a blessing if it separates you from Knowledge? The only true freedom is to live a life of Knowledge. Then you are free to truly be yourself. Then your contribution can be given maximally and you are fulfilled.</p>
<p>在生命中，除了你的独立，你还能放弃什么呢？如果自由使你与内识分离，那它会是一种祝福吗？唯一真正的自由是过一种内识的生命。然后你就能自由地真正做回你自己。然后你的贡献可以被最大限度地给予，你就会得到满足。</p>
<p>Yes, you must follow Teachers. Why? Because your Inner Teachers follow Teachers. That is how everyone finds his or her way Home. There are no individuals out there finding their way alone. Everyone is pulling everyone, following the person ahead and leading the person behind. That is how everyone files back to God.</p>
<p>是的，你必须跟随你的老师。为什么？因为你的内在老师也跟随着老师。这就是每个人如何找到他或她回家之路的方式。没有人能独自找到自己回家的路。每个人都在拉着另一个人，跟随着前面的人，带领着后面的人。这就是每个人如何回到上帝身边的方式。</p>
<p>You must give yourself in this life, or you will never experience your life here. You will return Home and realize you missed your opportunity completely. You see, when you are Home, it is very inspiring to come into the world because you are Home. When you are Home, everything is so apparent, and going down into the world for a few years does not seem difficult. But when you enter the world, you forget all that. Then you become a person of the world, and survival and gratification are your concerns.</p>
<p>你必须在这个生命中给予自己，否则你将永远无法经历你在这里的生命。当你回到家时，你会意识到你完全错过了你的机会。你看，当你在家的时候，来到这个世界是非常鼓舞人心的，因为你在你的家。当你在家里时，一切都那么显而易见，来到这个世界几年似乎并不困难。但是当你进入这个世界时，你就会忘记所有这些。然后你就会成为这个世界上的一个人，生存和满足将是你所关心的问题。</p>
<p>Your true gift is to contribute Knowledge and thus receive it for yourself. You must learn how to do this because the part of you that must learn is the part of you that belongs to the world. Your personality belongs to the world. Your body belongs to the world. You do not take them with you when you leave, for you do not need them in your Ancient Home. The personality and the body must be cultivated as vehicles, or they will not have the capacity to carry Knowledge. Then you will be a seed that never germinates, and you will go Home with your seed unopened.</p>
<p>你真实的礼物是贡献你的内识，从而为自己收到内识。你必须学习如何做到这一点，因为你必须学习的部分是你属于世界的部分。你的人格属于这个世界。你的身体属于这个世界。当你离开时，你不会把它们带走，因为在你的古老家园并不需要它们。人格和身体必须作为载体来培养，否则它们将没有能力承载内识。那么你将是一颗永远不会发芽的种子，你将带着你的种子回到家，而你的种子却没有发芽。</p>
<p>It is very important to think of yourself as a follower because you are always a follower of something. You can be a follower of your own indecision, a follower of your own beliefs, a follower of your own emotional states. The only thing you can command is the decision about what you will follow. That is the point at which you can take charge.</p>
<p>把自己当作一位跟随者是非常重要的，因为你总是一个东西的追随者。你可以是你自己优柔寡断的追随者，是你自己信仰的追随者，是你自己情绪的追随者。你唯一能指挥的是关于你将跟随什么的决定。在这一点上，你可以负责。</p>
<p>If you say, “I will follow Knowledge,” you cannot lead it. It is so powerful, how can you lead it? Where can you lead it? It has its own place to go. It will take you to the people who really need you. It will find you a husband or a wife if that is what you need. It will give you children if that is what you need.</p>
<p>如果你说，”我要跟随内识”，你就不能领导它。它是如此强大，你怎么能领导它？你能在哪里领导它呢？它有自己的归宿。它会带你找到真正需要你的人。它将为你找到一位丈夫或是一位是妻子，如果那是你所需要的。它将给你孩子，如果那是你所需要的。</p>
<p>It is difficult for students of Knowledge because they are still trying to go somewhere with their Knowledge. “Well, I am going to use Knowledge to be this or to have that.” But maybe Knowledge has a little different idea. You cannot bargain with it. It is a force. It does not negotiate. It does not compromise. It does not talk things over. It merely goes where it has to go, and if it cannot go there, then it is latent within you.</p>
<p>对内识的学生来说，它是很困难的，因为他们仍然试图用他们的内识达到某个目的。”好吧，我打算用内识来成为这个或拥有那个”。但是，也许内识有一点不同的想法。你不能与它讨价还价。它是一种力量。它不会讨价还价。它不会妥协。它不会讨论事情。它只是去它必须去的地方，如果它不能去那里，那么它就会潜伏在你的里面。</p>
<p>Therefore, We who are cultivating this world wish for you to be very kind with yourself. You cannot purify yourself. You cannot cleanse yourself. You cannot lift yourself up. Entering true preparation is entering a process with your Spiritual Family beyond the visible and with individuals in life here in very specific ways. You enroll in these things because you must. Is it right? Yes. That is it. You do not know what you are signing up for. If We were to tell people what they would do if their Knowledge were fulfilled, everyone would run away saying, “I had a different plan for myself!”</p>
<p>因此，我们培养着这个世界的人们，希望你能善待自己。你无法净化自己。你不能净化你自己。甚至你不能提升自己。进入真实的准备是进入一个与你的精神家庭超越可见范围的过程，并以非常特定的方式与这里的个人生命在一起。你参加这些活动是因为你必须参加。这是对的吗？是的。就是这样。你不知道你正在签署的是什么。如果我们告诉人们，如果他们的内识得到了满足，他们会做什么呢，每个人都会跑开说：”我对自己的生命有不同的计划！”</p>
<p>But what if We were to say, “If you do this, you will be a person of tremendous happiness. Your nature will be complemented. You will no longer be attempting to be in an idealistic state, to be a perfect person. You will be able to be in the moment because there is no future that you must negotiate. You will see beyond images. You will hear beyond words. You will sense beyond appearances. Life will become transparent to you in this world, and you will begin to see your Ancient Home through the transparency.”</p>
<p>但是如果我们说：”如果你这样做，你将成为一个拥有巨大幸福的人。你的本性将得到补充。你将不再试图处于一种理想化的状态，成为一个完美的人。你将能够处于当下，因为没有你必须协商的未来。你会看到图像之外的东西。你会听到无以言表的声音。你的感觉将超越表象。在这个世界上，生命对你来说将变得透明，而你将开始通过这种透明看到你的古老家园”。</p>
<p>Part of your preparation in being a student of Knowledge is that you must comprehend your nature. This is very important because you must realize your limitations. It is very important that you realize your limitations because you have them. That is when you become honest with yourself. That is part of growing up. If you are to be a true contributor in life, you must know your limitations. You must understand how you work, without all of this value judgment, and then you can work with your mental and physical vehicles most effectively.</p>
<p>要成为内识的学生，你准备的一部分是你必须理解你的本性。这是非常重要的，因为你必须意识到你的局限性。你意识到自己的局限性是非常重要的，因为你有它们。这就是你对自己变得诚实的时刻。这是成长的一部分。如果你想成为一名真实的生命贡献者，你必须知道你的局限性。你必须理解你是如何工作的，没有所有这些关于价值的判断，然后你就可以最有效地利用你的心理和身体的载体。</p>
<p>Your body has a certain shape and certain characteristics. Your mind is like that, too. It is not your function to transcend your nature. It is your function to use it as a vehicle for contribution because your nature here is temporary. Why perfect the temporary? You do not have time to perfect it. You lose it long before it is perfected. It is like preparing a meal and taking too long. By the time you get to the end of it, everything has spoiled. Your mind, your body and your personality—their highest option is to become vehicles for Knowledge.</p>
<p>你的身体有一定的形状和某些特征。你的心智也是如此。超越你的本性并不是你的职责。你的职责是利用它作为贡献的工具，因为你在这里的自性是暂时的。为什么要去完善暂时的？你没有时间去完善它。在它被完善之前，你早已经失去了它。这就像准备一顿饭菜，花了很长的时间。当你吃到最后的时候，一切都已经变质了。你的心灵、你的身体和你的人格——它们的最高选择是成为内识的载体。</p>
<p>Yes, there are corrections to be made. Yes, you must alter your behavior. Yes, you must be able to restrain yourself in certain ways. But how can you have appreciation for yourself if you are always attempting to be an absolutely perfect person? Of course you will have fears. Of course you will have certain ways that you do things. You do not need to be limited by this, but you must understand that it is your nature.</p>
<p>是的，有些地方需要更正。是的，你必须改变你的行为。是的，你必须能够在某些方面约束自己。但是，如果你总是试图成为一位绝对完美的人，你怎么能够欣赏自己呢？你当然会有恐惧。当然，你会有一些特定的方法来做一些事情。你不需要被这个限制，但你必须理解这是你的自性。</p>
<p>You see, the function which you will be given once your Knowledge is cultivated to a certain point will give you a role in life that is completely complementary to your nature. It is a very great blessing that God wants you to be exactly the way you were made. Your nature is absolutely perfect for your function, yet it is hard to understand your nature because you do not see its relevance to your function. You are custom made for something that you have not discovered yet. When you discover your function, your life becomes more about honoring your nature than attempting to change it. You will have to become a master of it, however, for there are liabilities as well as assets, and you cannot justify the liabilities. You must learn to accept and to use your nature wisely.</p>
<p>你看，一旦你的内识培养到一定程度，你将被赋予的功能将给你一个完全与你的自性互补的生命角色。上帝要你完全按照他所造你的方式去做，它是一个极大的祝福。你的自性对于你的功能来说是绝对完美的，但却很难理解你的自性，因为你看不到它与你的功能的相关性。你是为你还没有发现的东西量身定制的。当你发现自己的功能时，你的生命将变得更多的是尊重你的本性，而不是试图改变它。然而，你必须成为它的主人，因为有负债也有资产，而你不能为你的负债而辩护。你必须学会接受并明智地运用你的自性。</p>
<p>Therefore, let Us honor those who gave beyond choice, those in whom giving gave itself. And let Us be thankful that it did so, for Knowledge has been kept alive in the world. Knowledge is the oasis in a dry and thirsty land. It does not matter that the theologians came and constructed wonderful belief systems for their own survival. It does not matter that the thought system that was a result of Knowledge giving calcified and became a restraint for people. That always happens. When Knowledge disappears, thought begins. When people cannot know, they invent things to give themselves temporary stability to allay their own anxiety. For without Knowledge, all there is, is anxiety.</p>
<p>因此，让我们向那些超越选择的给予者致敬，向那些给予它本身的人致敬。让我们感谢它们这样做，因为内识在这个世界上一直保持着活力。内识是干旱土地上的绿洲。神学家们为了自己的生存而来，并构建了美妙的信仰体系，这并不重要。而由内识所导致的思想体系的僵化，成为了人们的束缚，这并不重要。这种情况总是发生。当内识消失的时候，思想就开始出现。当人们不知道的时候，他们就会发明一些东西来给自己暂时的稳定，以减轻自己的焦虑。因为没有内识，有的只是焦虑。</p>
<p>Let Us honor those in whom giving gave itself. They had to develop themselves so that they would not stand in the way of the giving. They did not attempt to use it for other purposes. They honor why We have all come here. What a great blessing it is to leave the world and say, “Ah, I brought nothing back with me but these people. I came back with a full heart and empty hands.”</p>
<p>让我们向那些给予它本身的人致敬。他们必须发展自己，以便不妨碍给予的方式。他们没有试图将其用于其他目的。他们尊重我们所有人来到这里的原因。当他们离开这个世界时，他们说：”啊，除了这些人，我什么也没有带回来，这是多么大的祝福啊。我带着满满的心和空空的手回来了。</p>
<p>Then your Ancient Home is established here as well as there. And do you know what happens next? Well, when everyone in your little group that you are working with is complete in this world, you all move on to another place where Home has been denied, and then you re-establish Home there. Then you save that world. What needs saving but a place where Home has been lost temporarily? When all places have been reclaimed, then the work will be over and the fun begins. When you are Home, your experience of God’s Presence is magnificent, but even there your experience is not complete, for it is evolving as well. Yet it is as great as your capacity, and as your capacity grows through time, so will the experience of Presence be ever greater and more inclusive for you. It will be your supreme joy to contribute this wherever you go.</p>
<p>然后，你的古老家园在这里和那里都被建立起来。而你知道接下来会发生什么吗？好吧，当与你一起工作的小型团体中的每个人都在这个世界上完成时，你们都将被转移到另一个家园被否认的地方，然后你们在那里重新建立你们的家园。然后你们拯救了那个世界。除了一个暂时失去了”家”的地方，还有什么需要拯救？当所有的地方都被夺回时，工作就会结束，乐趣就会开始。当你在”家”的时候，你对上帝的临在的经历是宏伟的，但即使在那里，你的经历也是不完整的，因为它也在不断的发展。然而，它和你的能力一样伟大，而你的能力随着时间的推移而增长，对你来说，临在的经历也将越来越大，越来越包容。无论你走到哪里，贡献这一点都将是你最大的快乐。</p>
<p>Therefore, let us give thanks for those who gave, for their giving is a reminder of our own purpose here. And as we become contributors to life, we will see that life gives contributors to us to make sure that our needs are met and our hearts are filled.</p>
<p>因此，让我们感谢那些给予的人，因为他们的给予提醒着我们在这里的目的。当我们成为生命的贡献者时，我们将会看到，生命给予我们贡献者，以确保我们的需求得到满足，并让我们的心得到满足。</p>
