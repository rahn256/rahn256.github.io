<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on June 27, 2008 in Boulder, CO<br>2008年6月27日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of the Great Waves of change, it is important that you are not isolated and that other people know who you are and where you are—people who can assist you, people whose wisdom you can rely upon, people who can support you in times of need. This network of relationships, to whatever extent it can be established or is established already, is vitally important.</p>
<p>面对变革的巨浪，重要的是你不能孤立无援，让其他人知道你是谁，你在哪里——那些可以帮助你的人，你可以依赖其智慧的人，以及在需要时能够支持你的人。这种关系网络，不论它在多大程度上已经建立或尚待建立，都至关重要。</p>
<p>You will need great assistance from others. You will not be able to completely take care of yourself in the face of the Great Waves of change. You will need others for guidance, for assistance, and, under great duress, you will need someone to help you to feed yourself and take care of yourself. It will be a great dilemma for those who are isolated, for those who have never built a functioning and supportive network of relationships.</p>
<p>在面对巨浪般的变革时，你将需要他人的巨大帮助。你将无法完全独立照顾你自己。你会需要他人的指导和帮助，而在极度压力下，你将需要有人帮助你来养活你自己并照顾你自己。对于那些孤立无援、从未建立有效支持关系网络的人来说，这将是一个巨大的困境。</p>
<p>It is unwise to live far away from the cities, where provisions can be provided and where you can gain access to the very fundamental things that you will need. If you are far away from the cities and are not closely engaged with your neighbors, you will be isolated and on your own.</p>
<p>居住在远离城市的地方是不明智的，因为在城市里可以得到供给，可以获得你所需要的最基础资源。如果你远离城市，不与你的邻居密切接触，你就会孤立无援，只能依靠你自己。</p>
<p>In the future, people will be abandoning their homes in the distant country, seeking food, energy, shelter and security. It will not be safe living alone in outlying districts, as there will be much crime and thievery. This will be due to the fact that there will be many people out of work, desperately seeking for anything that they can use or sell. For someone living alone in the country, they will be very vulnerable, and law enforcement will not be sufficient to protect them, for the needs of rural communities will be so immense that law enforcement will be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>在未来，人们将放弃远方的家园，寻找食物、能源、住所和安全。独自居住在偏远地区并不安全，因为那里会有很多犯罪和偷窃行为。这是因为会有很多人失业，拼命寻找可以使用或出售的资源。对于一个独自生活在乡村的人来说，他们将非常脆弱，执法部门将不足以保护他们，因为乡村社区的需求将是如此巨大，以至于执法部门将不堪重负。</p>
<p>That is why your preparation for the Great Waves must begin far in advance of extreme or difficult situations. If you wait, if you hold yourself back from your preparation, if you wait until there is agreement and consensus, then you will have very few options. You will have very few options and very few choices. Here, as has been the case throughout human history, your strength will lie in Knowledge within you and within your primary relationships and community, to whatever extent they have been established.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须在极端或困难的情况发生之前就开始为变革巨浪做准备。如果你等待，如果你对你的准备工作束手无策，如果你等到达成一致意见和共识，那你的选择就会非常少。你将没有多少选择和多少选项。在这里，正如整个人类历史上的情况一样，你的力量将在于你的内识以及你的主要关系和社区，无论它们已经建立到何种程度。</p>
<p>That is why now is the time to begin to share the reality of the Great Waves with those people whom you know—with your friends and your relatives, even with your neighbors. Perhaps only a few of them will be able to respond, but nonetheless you are building your own social security for the future, for there will be very little social security from your governments.</p>
<p>因此，现在是时候开始与你所认识的人分享巨浪的现实——与你的朋友、亲戚，甚至是邻居。也许只有少数人能够做出响应，但你正在为自己的未来建立社会保障，因为来自政府提供的社会保障将会非常有限。</p>
<p>Your situation then has to be completely reevaluated, and that is part of the deep evaluation that will be required. You will have to figure out how to find a way to get to your neighbors, your friends and your allies, particularly if you live in a rural area where the distances can be great. Rural living will become very hazardous unless you have established a high degree of self-sufficiency. But that is very difficult to achieve and can only be prolonged for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>这时，你必须对自己的处境进行彻底的重新评估，这也是需要进行的深入评估的一部分。你必须想出办法与你的邻居、朋友和盟友取得联系，尤其是如果你住在距离很远的农村地区。除非你已经建立了高度的自给自足的能力，否则农村生活将变得非常危险。但这是很难实现的，而且只能维持在一段时间之中。</p>
<p>In the future, agricultural areas will be protected to some degree, but many people live in rural areas who are not focused primarily on agriculture, thinking they want to be closer to nature as in an early era. Thinking they want to be away from the stress and the difficulties of living in cities and urban areas, they move now far away.</p>
<p>在未来，农业区将在一定程度上得到保护，但许多人居住在农村地区，并不主要从事农业，他们认为自己想要更接近自然，就像早期的时代一样。他们希望远离城市生活的压力和困难，因此选择远离城市和城市地区。</p>
<p>But the world is changing. Your situation is changing and will change even more. What you previously sought as a reprieve, as a retreat, now becomes a hazard. When fuel supplies become extremely low and there are shortages, how will you function? Even your nearest towns may not have food, petroleum and medicine, for these things will be focused in large cities, where large congregations of people live. Outlying districts will have difficulty acquiring even the most fundamental things.</p>
<p>但世界在变。你的处境正在发生变化，而且将发生更大的变化。你以前寻求的是缓和，是退路，现在变成了危险。当燃料供应变得极度短缺时，你将如何运作？即使是离你最近的城镇也可能没有食物、石油和药品，因为这些资源都将集中在大城市，因为这里居住着大量的人群。外围地区甚至连最基本的资源都难以获得。</p>
<p>Everything has to be reconsidered in the face of the Great Waves of change. Isolation here, even within a large city, is very hazardous. And this is particularly true for single mothers. It is particularly true for the elderly. It is particularly true for children and for people who have handicaps and are disabled. How will they know what to do when there are shortages of food, or shortages of water, or shortages of petroleum, or when they are unable to heat their homes or their apartments? For all these circumstances will arise within the Great Waves of change, even in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>面对变革的巨浪，每件事情都必须重新考虑。在这里，孤立无援，即使是在一个大城市里，也是非常危险的。这对于单身母亲来说尤为真实。对于老年人来说尤为真实，对于儿童、残障人士来说同样如此。当食物短缺、水资源短缺、石油短缺，或当他们无法为自己的家或公寓取暖时，他们将如何应对？所有这些情况都将在巨浪般的变革中出现，即使在富裕国家也不例外。</p>
<p>Do not think here that if you live in a rural area that you can stockpile food and medicine, for how long will that last you? And what will prevent people coming to steal it from you, coming in the night, coming in the day? Your retreat has now become an isolation, a hazardous isolation.</p>
<p>不要以为如果你住在农村地区，你就可以囤积食物和药品，因为这能维持你多久呢？又有什么能阻止其他人来偷走你的资源，无论是在夜间还是白天？你的避难所现在变成了一种孤立，一种危险的孤立。</p>
<p>In the future, people will flock to the cities for food, for energy, for medicine and for security. Great congregations of people will come from outlying districts, where supplies will fall short. You do not want to be at the bottom of the list, living in a town or a village. It could take weeks or months for supplies to reach you.</p>
<p>在未来，人们会为了食物、能源、医药和安全而涌入城市。大量人口将从供应短缺的外围地区涌入城市。你不想处于名单的底端，生活在乡镇或村庄。供应可能需要几周甚至几个月才能到达你的村庄。</p>
<p>People think, “Oh, this cannot be. It is impossible. This will never happen!” But this has happened countless times throughout human history, and in the face of the Great Waves of change, these circumstances are inevitable. How is your nation going to survive and function on half of the energy resources it is using now? And who will be the first to receive these resources and to receive assistance from your government?</p>
<p>人们会想：”哦，这不可能。这是不会发生的。这永远不会发生！”但是，这种情况在人类历史上已经发生过无数次，面对变革的巨浪，这些情况是不可避免的。你的国家将如何仅靠现有的一半能源和资源进行生存和运作？谁将最先获得这些资源并得到政府的援助？</p>
<p>It is a different world you are entering, a different set of circumstances. If you can see the Great Waves of change—if you will take the time to study them, to read about them and to consider them—you will see how absolutely vulnerable you are and how vulnerable people are who are isolated—geographically isolated, socially isolated or circumstantially isolated.</p>
<p>你们正在进入的是一个不同的世界，是一套不同的环境。如果你能看到变革的巨浪——如果你愿意花时间去研究它们、阅读它们、思考它们——你就会发现自己是多么的脆弱，而那些孤立无援的人——地理上的孤立、社会上的孤立或环境上的孤立的人，又是多么的脆弱。</p>
<p>That is why it is so important to educate your friends, family and neighbors about the Great Waves of change, to collaborate with them and to create a plan of assistance—to have contingency plans in case certain things transpire, to have homes where you can gather, to build a reserve of resources so that you are not immediately in danger and to bond together if necessary and provide assistance and support for one another.</p>
<p>这就是为什么教育你的朋友、家人和邻居学习变革的巨浪是如此重要，与他们合作并制定一套援助计划是非常重要的——制定应急计划以防某些事情的发生，建立资源储备以避免立即陷入危险，并在必要时团结起来，为彼此提供援助和支持。</p>
<p>This community preparedness is so vitally important, even in outlying rural areas. You will have to have enough provisions to provide for yourself in the interim, to support people who may come to you who have nothing, to consider the predicament for elderly persons living in your proximity and to have enough resources to provide for them if necessary or to assist them. This will make the difference between a set of circumstances being difficult and being catastrophic.</p>
<p>即使在偏远的农村地区，这种社区准备工作也是至关重要的。你必须准备好足够的物资，以便在过渡期间养活自己，支持可能来到你身边的一无所有的人，考虑到居住在你附近的老人的困境，并准备好足够的资源，以便在必要时为他们提供帮助。这将使一系列情况在困难和灾难之间有所区别。</p>
<p>Community preparedness is very important. It is very significant. That is why this book has provided “Recommendations” for preparing for the Great Waves of change. These are beginning steps. If people will take these steps, they will be in a much better position. But to change one’s circumstances takes time and takes effort and courage and is often quite difficult to do, particularly if you are in a family where others do not agree with you.</p>
<p>社区备灾的准备工作是非常重要的。它是意义重大的。因此，本书提供了应对变革巨浪的“建议”。这些都是开始的步骤。如果人们愿意采取这些步骤，他们的处境就会好得多。但是，改变自己的处境需要时间，需要努力和勇气，而且往往很难做到，特别是如果你身处一个家人不同意你的家庭。</p>
<p>Time is of the essence then. You need this time to consider where you live, how you live, how you can get about, where you will be able to provision yourself, where those provisions might be and to build a network of support with your friends, family and neighbors who are living in your proximity. This will give you time to relieve yourself of unnecessary possessions, activities or obligations that are draining your energy away from this primary focus and emphasis.</p>
<p>因此，时间至关重要。你需要这段时间来考虑你住在哪里、如何生活、如何出行、在哪里能够为自己提供食物、这些食物可能来自哪里，并与你附近的朋友、家人和邻居建立一个支持网络。这将使你有时间从不必要的财产、活动或义务中解脱出来，因为它们会耗费你的能量，使你无法专注于这一首要任务和重点。</p>
<p>If there are shortages of fuel, what will you do? This is a particularly serious problem for people living in outlying rural areas or far away from distribution centers. They will be the last to receive whatever provisions can be provided. How are they going to function in their homes, on their farms and in their personal retreats? And how long will they be able to last, even if they have set aside resources and provisions? Even the “Recommendations” given in this book emphasize that stockpiling resources and provisions is only a short-term emphasis. It is only to enable you to pass through shocks or difficult periods. They are not permanent solutions.</p>
<p>如果出现燃料短缺，你会怎么做？这对生活在偏远农村地区或远离分配中心的人来说，这个问题尤为严重。他们将是最后收到可以提供的任何物资的人。他们将如何在自己的家里、农场和个人的隐居地进行生活？即使他们预留了资源和物资，他们又能坚持多久？甚至本书给出的”建议”也强调，储备资源和供给只是一个短期的重点。它只是为了使你能够度过冲击或困难时期。它们并不是永久性的解决方案。</p>
<p>It is very important, then, that you begin to face the Great Waves of change and to share this message with others and to honestly discuss with them, if they are open to it, ways that you can be of future assistance to one another if necessary.</p>
<p>因此，非常重要的是，你要开始面对变革的巨浪，并与其他人分享这一讯息，如果他们愿意的话，坦诚地与他们讨论在必要时你们未来可以互相帮助的方式。</p>
<p>As you can see through reading the words in this book what a great and significant thing this really is, how quickly people’s circumstances can change, how little it would take to throw your situation into enormous jeopardy and how utterly reliant you are upon resources coming from afar—resources that you take for granted, resources that you never question. What would happen if they were no longer available to you?</p>
<p>通过阅读这本书中的文字，你可以看到这真的是一件多么伟大和重要的事情，人们的境况可以多么迅速地改变，只需很少的变化就能使你的处境陷入巨大危险，以及你是多么地依赖远方的资源——你认为是理所当然的资源，你从未质疑的资源。如果你不再拥有这些资源，会发生什么？</p>
<p>You must think of these things now—not emotionally, but reasonably—considering your advantages and disadvantages based upon where you live, how you live and how you travel about. What assets do you have? What are your liabilities? What is the strength of your position? Do you need to change your living circumstances radically in the face of the Great Waves of change? If so, you will need to do this fairly quickly because these things take time, and time is what you do not have a lot of. If there are shortages of fuel, or if the price of everything escalates beyond what you can afford, what will you do then? Complain? Cry? Break down? Have a tantrum? Having never thought of these things before, the shock will be overwhelming to you, and you will have few choices in what to do.</p>
<p>你现在必须考虑这些事情——不是感性地考虑，而是理性地考虑——根据你的居住地、生活方式和出行方式来考虑你的优势和劣势。你有哪些资产？你有哪些负债？您的优势是什么？面对变革的巨浪，你是否需要彻底改变自己的生活环境？如果是的话，你需要尽快行动，因为这些都需要时间，而时间是你所不具备的。如果出现燃料短缺，或者如果所有商品的价格都上涨到你无法承受的程度，你会怎么办？抱怨？哭泣？崩溃？发脾气？由于以前从未想过这些事情，这种冲击将使你不知所措，而你在做什么方面几乎没有选择。</p>
<p>That is why the wise are always considering what is coming over the horizon. They are always looking and watching. They are not afraid and not terrified, but cautious. For all the people who are sensing great change in the world, and there are many of you who are experiencing this even now, it is important to look at what that change might be and how you will need to prepare yourself for it, given whatever resources that you have.</p>
<p>这就是为什么明智的人总是在考虑地平线上会出现的事情。他们总是在寻找和观察。他们并不害怕，也不恐惧，而是谨慎行事。对于所有感觉到世界巨大变化的人来说，你们中的许多人甚至现在就在经历这种变化，重要的是要看看这种变化可能是什么，以及你将需要如何为它做好准备，考虑到你拥有的任何资源。</p>
<p>Here you cannot rely upon governments or political parties or technological innovations, for these alone will not be sufficient to protect the people—the people of your nation, the people of your city, the people of your town or village—from the great impacts of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能依靠政府、政党或技术创新，因为仅靠这些不足以保护人民——你们国家的人民、你们城市的人民、你们城镇或乡村的人民——免受变革巨浪的巨大冲击。</p>
<p>Because the climate will be changing, there will be a tremendous loss of food productivity in the world. And because fuel supplies will become more expensive and difficult to get, it will be harder for large farms to produce enough food. Food will be a major emphasis, as it is already in the poorer nations. But even in the wealthy nations, food will be a major priority—not simply the price of food, but the availability of food. That is why you maintain a provision to last you at least a month so you have time to consider what you must do next and not simply be thrown into panic or desperation.</p>
<p>由于气候将发生变化，世界上的粮食生产率将大幅下降。由于燃料供应将变得更加昂贵和难以获得，大型农场将更难生产足够的粮食。粮食将是一个主要的重点，因为它在较贫穷的国家已是如此。但即使是在富裕国家，粮食也将是一个主要的优先事项——不仅仅是粮食的价格，而是粮食的供应。这就是为什么你要保持至少一个月的供应量，这样你就有时间考虑下一步该做什么，而不是简单地陷入恐慌或绝望之中。</p>
<p>If you can begin to prepare, you will gain confidence. If you do nothing, you will lose heart. You will be defeated before the trials have even appeared, before the difficulties have even really reached you. Some people will capitulate even at the idea that they must reconsider their lives and prepare for the Great Waves of change. It is sad that their courage and integrity have become so weakened that they would give in so easily. Their plight will be extreme. Now it will be up to other people to take care of them, when in fact it is they who should be taking care of other people.</p>
<p>如果你能开始准备，你就会获得信心。如果你什么都不做，你就会失去信心。在考验出现之前，在困难真正降临之前，你就会被打败。有些人甚至一想到他们必须重新考虑自己的生活并为变革的巨浪做好准备，就会屈服。可悲的是，他们的勇气和正直已经变得如此薄弱，以至于他们会如此轻易地屈服。他们的困境将是极端的。现在将由其他人来照顾他们，而实际上应该由他们来照顾其他人。</p>
<p>You will see this. You will see all the demonstrations of human ignorance, human denial, human folly and human fantasy in the face of the Great Waves of change. Everything will become amplified. If someone was being foolish before, they will likely be more foolish now. If someone was living on a set of weak assumptions, they will assert those assumptions even more strongly now. If someone was living in a state of denial, they will increase their expression of denial until they can no longer do so.</p>
<p>你将看到这一切。你将看到人类的无知、人类的否认、人类的愚蠢和人类的幻想在变革的巨浪面前的所有表现。一切都会被放大。如果有人以前是愚蠢的，他们现在可能会更加愚蠢。如果有人以前生活在一套薄弱的假设之上，他们现在会更强烈地主张这些假设。如果有人以前是生活在否认的状态之中，他们现在将会更多地表达自己的否认，直到无法再否认为止。</p>
<p>Here you must be prepared. There will be utter panic, chaos and desperation around you as people, now caught off guard, have to face a really difficult situation for which they have not prepared—a situation that is now undermining their whole life and reality.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须做好准备。你的周围会出现极度的恐慌、混乱和绝望，因为人们现在措手不及，不得不面对他们毫无准备的真正困难的局面——这种局面现在正在破坏他们的整个生活和现实。</p>
<p>What would it take to produce such a powerful impact? A fuel shortage in your nation, your state or your region—that alone would do it. A violent weather event. A hurricane, a tornado or extreme drought as the planet heats, and all of a sudden, there is not enough water for both human beings and for agriculture. It would take so very little to throw your life into jeopardy.</p>
<p>要怎样才能产生如此强大的影响？你所在的国家、州或地区出现燃料短缺——仅这一点就能做到。一次剧烈的天气事件。比如飓风、龙卷风或地球升温导致的极端干旱，突然之间，水资源不足以供应人类生活和农业所需。只需很少的事情就能使你的生活陷入危险之中。</p>
<p>Everyone is living on a set of assumptions based upon a weak and fragile infrastructure. Should the infrastructure break, as it will, people will suddenly be thrown into desperation and confusion. It is those who can be forewarned, it is those who have the courage to face the inevitable changes that will come and the grave possibilities they bring with them that will be strong enough to withstand these challenges and to provide strength, encouragement and direction for others.</p>
<p>每个人都生活在一套基于薄弱而脆弱的基础设施的假设之上。一旦基础设施崩溃，人们将突然陷入绝望和混乱之中。只有那些能够未雨绸缪的人，只有那些有勇气面对即将到来的不可避免的变化及其带来的严重可能性的人，才会有足够的力量来抵御这些挑战，并为其他人提供力量、鼓励和方向。</p>
<p>Therefore, do not worry about trying to change the awareness of everyone. It is your awareness that must change. It is you who must reach out to whoever is in your proximity that can support and assist you in your efforts. People have talents. They have wisdom. They have skills. These will all have to be brought together for the welfare of everyone involved. Even if you cannot get your town or city to develop a preparation plan, you can still reach out to certain people and establish a network with them.</p>
<p>因此，不要为试图改变每个人的觉知而担心。必须改变的是你的觉知。是你必须向在你附近的、能够支持和协助你努力的人伸出援手。人们都有才能。他们有智慧。他们有技能。为了每个人的福祉，这些都必须被汇集在一起。即使你不能让你所在的城镇或城市制定一个准备计划，你也可以联系某些人，与他们建立一个网络。</p>
<p>The situation calls for human strength, but it will also reveal human weakness in all of its manifestations. A great difficulty the human family has is in not preparing for the future—not preparing for the real future, not thinking ahead, not being able to look out on the world with clear and objective eyes and not considering the possibilities, the probabilities and the extreme likelihood of great change.</p>
<p>这种情况需要人类的力量，但也会暴露出人类各种表现形式的弱点。人类大家庭面临的一个巨大困难是没有为未来做好准备——没有为真正的未来做好准备，没有未雨绸缪，不能以清晰客观的眼光看待世界，没有考虑到巨变的可能性、概率和极端可能性。</p>
<p>You are living in a world of decline. The availability of fuel, the availability of electricity, the availability of food, and in some places water, will become ever greater problems as your environment is unable to provide for the over-arching demands of people and the way that they live.</p>
<p>你生活在一个衰落的世界里。燃料的供应、电力的供应、食物的供应，以及在某些地方水的供应，都将成为越来越大的问题，因为你们的环境无法满足人们的总体需求和他们的生活方式。</p>
<p>Medicines will be difficult to acquire, particularly if you are living in outlying or rural regions. It will not be as it is today, where you can simply order things electronically and they will be delivered. Such deliveries may not be possible in the future. What are you going to do if you require these medications?</p>
<p>药品将难以获得，尤其是如果你生活在偏远或农村地区。它不会像今天这样，你可以简单地通过电子方式订购商品，就会有人送货上门。未来可能无法实现这种配送。如果你需要这些药物，你要怎么做？</p>
<p>These are all extremely practical and realistic questions now. Perhaps they were unthinkable before, and you never concerned yourself with them. But now you must concern yourself with them, for you are facing a set of changes in the world that will alter the availability and the distribution of resources, fundamental resources. And you will see how vulnerable you really are in even considering these things, particularly if you are living in isolation geographically or socially. That is why it takes time to build access to other people who are aware of the Great Waves of change, to help one another to consider what must be done and to use the “Recommendations” that are presented here as a starting point.</p>
<p>现在，这些都是极为实际和现实的问题。也许这些问题在以前是不可想象的，你也从未关注过它们。但现在，你必须关注它们，因为你正面临着世界的一系列变化，这些变化将改变资源的可用性和分配，基础的资源。你会发现，即使考虑到这些事情，你也是多么脆弱，尤其是如果你在地理上或社会上孤立地生活着。这就是为什么你需要花时间与其他察觉到变革巨浪的人建立联系，帮助彼此考虑必须采取的措施，并把这里提出的“建议”作为一个起点。</p>
<p>It will require a lot of energy and time to do this—energy and time that now is being given to things of perhaps little or no value, or things that are certainly not essential for your future well-being. Take all of the energy that you might use currently in complaining about the world, complaining about other people, complaining about your government or complaining about life, and bring that focus and energy to bear in preparing for the Great Waves of change, in building a network of support with other people and in educating your local community. The majority of people are unaware that the Great Waves are coming, and when those Waves arrive, they will not be ready.</p>
<p>要做到这一点，需要大量的能量和时间——这些能量和时间现在都用在了可能价值很小或没有价值的事情上，或者用在了对你未来的幸福肯定不是至关重要的事情上。把你目前可能用于抱怨世界、抱怨他人、抱怨政府或抱怨生命的所有能量，集中起来，用在为变革的巨浪做准备上，用在与他人建立支持性的网络上，用在教育当地的社区上。大多数人都没有察觉到巨浪即将到来，而当巨浪来临时，他们还没有准备好。</p>
<p>Life is about living fully in the moment and about preparing wisely for the future. That is what the animals do. That is what human beings must learn to do if they are to be intelligent. It is coming back into the natural world and leaving your artificial world of technology—your artificial world that is based upon weak assumptions, assumptions based upon a weak and overextended infrastructure—that supports you with what you need.</p>
<p>生命就是完全活在当下，并明智地为未来做准备。动物们就是这样做的。如果人类是智能的，就必须学会这样做。它是回到自然世界，离开你们的人造科技世界——你们的科技世界是建立在薄弱的假设之上的，是建立在薄弱和过度扩张的基础设施之上的——它支撑着你们所需要的一切。</p>
<p>Do not think that because the nation you live in is large and highly populated and that there is wealth and technology that it cannot fail in the face of the Great Waves of change and that society itself cannot be undone at the very core. Even as food becomes more expensive, and in places unavailable, it is going to push your economic stability over the edge. And this is happening already. Think now, what would happen if this price increase did not stop?</p>
<p>不要认为你生活的国家面积大、人口众多、拥有财富和技术，它就不会在变革的巨浪面前失败，社会它本身无法从根本上改变。即使食物变得更加昂贵，有些地方甚至无法获得食物，它也会将你们的经济稳定性推到边缘。而这种情况已经发生。现在就想一想，如果价格上涨不停止，会出现什么情况？</p>
<p>You are preparing for a world in decline. If you have lived in a wealthy and affluent nation, it is going to be a very difficult recognition and transition to make. It will be difficult in large part because of your ideas, your assumptions and your beliefs and the weakness that has been established over time in disabling you from facing difficult and unexpected circumstances.</p>
<p>你正在为一个衰落的世界做准备。如果你一直生活在一个富裕的国家，这将是一个非常困难的认识和过渡。它之所以困难，在很大程度上是因为你的想法、你的假设和你的信念，以及长期以来在使你无法面对困难和意外情况方面建立的弱点。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must bridge your isolation. Become involved in your local community. Speak in your local city councils and governments. Find out what your town or your city or your nation is doing to prepare for these great difficulties. Read, become educated, go visit people, participate. Escape your isolation and self-obsession. Become involved. Become an advocate. Share the revelation in this book with other people. Read what other people are discovering as they begin to discern the Great Waves of change. This is healthy for you. It is redemptive for you. It will give you confidence if you act. If you do nothing, your confidence will fall away, and you will sink into despair. Then you will be truly powerless and truly vulnerable.</p>
<p>因此，你必须弥合你的孤立状态。参与到你的当地社区中。在你当地的市议会和政府中发言。找出你的城镇或你的城市或你的国家正在做什么来准备这些巨大的困难。阅读，接受教育，去拜访他人，参与其中。摆脱你的孤立和自我迷恋。成为参与者。成为一个倡导者。与其他人分享这本书中的启示。阅读其他人在开始辨别变革巨浪时的发现。这对你来说是健康的。这对你来说是救赎性的。如果你采取行动，它将给你带来信心。如果你什么都不做，你的信心就会消失，你会陷入绝望。到那时，你将真正的无能为力，真正的不堪一击。</p>
<p>The situation calls for you to become powerful, for you to become engaged with others, for you to escape your own hellish isolation, for you to take action, for you to realize your strength, to utilize your skills and to utilize the skills of other people, knowing that alone you cannot prepare adequately for the great change that is coming now.</p>
<p>这种局势要求你变得强大，要求你与他人合作，摆脱自己那可怕的孤立感，要求你采取行动，意识到自己的力量，使用自己的技能以及他人的技能，因为你知道，单靠自己是无法为即将到来的巨大变化做好充分准备的。</p>
<p>If you live in a desert region, you may have to leave, as there may be no water for you in the future, and it may be very difficult for food to reach your community. Do not live near moving water, near rivers that will overflow in the face of violent weather and changing climate conditions. It is wise to move away from coastal regions that will be affected by violent weather and in many cases from certain large cities that will be subject to extreme social unrest.</p>
<p>如果你住在沙漠地区，你可能不得不离开，因为未来可能没有水，食物可能很难到达你的社区。不要住在流动的水域附近，不要住在面对恶劣天气和不断变化的气候条件时会泛滥的河流附近。明智的做法是，远离会受到恶劣天气影响的沿海地区，在许多情况下，远离某些会受到极端社会动荡影响的大城市。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you, the greater intelligence that God has given you, will give you direction and will give you signs and will provide steps for you to take. You take these steps without fully understanding the whole process or the outcome. You simply take the steps. Knowledge will speak to you through your thoughts, through your feelings. But it will not speak through fear, it will not speak through fantasy, and it will not speak to your preferences. You must be open, asking Knowledge within yourself, “What must I do now? What is the next step for me? How shall I regard this particular situation? What decision should I make regarding this particular thing?”</p>
<p>你内心的内识，上帝赋予你的更大智能，会给你指引方向，会给你迹象，会提供你要采取的步骤。你采取这些步骤，并不完全理解整个过程或结果。你只需采取内识的进阶。内识会通过你的感想、你的感受与你对话。但它不会通过恐惧说话，它不会通过幻想说话，也不会根据你的喜好说话。你必须敞开心扉，问自己内心的内识：”我现在必须做什么？我下一步该怎么做？我应该如何看待这种特殊情况？在这个特殊情况中我应该做出什么决定？</p>
<p>You must stay with this. You have to get past fear and rejection, shock and awe, to get into a place of greater clarity and objectivity so that you can respond to Knowledge, feel Knowledge, hear Knowledge and see the signs that Knowledge is giving you.</p>
<p>你必须坚持这样做。你必须超越恐惧和拒绝、震惊和敬畏，进入一个更加清晰和客观的地方，这样你才能够回应内心的内识，感受到内识，聆听内识，看见内识给你的迹象。</p>
<p>You cannot solve this problem for the world. You cannot solve this problem for the nation. You first must build your ark. And you must build the ark before the rains come, before the great change is upon you. You must help others build arks, and you must join your ark with theirs so that you have relationship and community.</p>
<p>你无法为世界解决这个问题。你无法为国家解决这个问题。你必须首先建造自己的方舟。你必须在大雨来临之前，在巨变来临之前建造方舟。你必须帮助他人建造方舟，你必须把你的方舟和他们的方舟连在一起，这样你就有了关系和社区。</p>
<p>Your strength is in Knowledge, relationship and community. All three of these now become primary. It is more important than wealth. It is more important than pleasure. It is more important than seeking escape. It is more important than your hobbies and your obsessions. It is more important than your romances and your tragedies. Building your connection to Knowledge, building strong relationships with others and becoming part of a community of preparation—this is what really matters.</p>
<p>你的力量在于内识、关系和社区。现在，这三者都变得至关重要。它比财富更重要。它比快乐更重要。它比寻求逃避更重要。它比你的爱好和痴迷更重要。比你的浪漫和你的悲剧更重要。建立你与内识的连接，与他人建立牢固的关系，成为准备社区的一部分——这才是真正重要的。</p>
<p>You must function on only partial awareness and partial certainty. You will not know everything that needs to be done. No one knows that. You will have to choose carefully who you listen to, for some people will give you very bad advice. Even people who are aware of the Great Waves of change can give you very bad advice as to what you must do.</p>
<p>你必须在只有部分觉知和部分确定性的情况下运作。你不可能知道所有需要做的事情。没有人知道这一点。你必须谨慎选择你的听众，因为有些人会给你非常糟糕的建议。即使是察觉到变革巨浪的人，也会在你必须做什么的问题上给你非常糟糕的建议。</p>
<p>Here the strength of your relationships will help you, for it is more difficult to deceive two minds than it is to deceive one. Here you must bring everything to Knowledge. Ask Knowledge, “Is this a good idea?” Ask Knowledge, “Should I follow the recommendations of this person?” Perhaps you will feel resistance; perhaps Knowledge will be silent. Both indicate that you should stop and not proceed with that decision or follow that person.</p>
<p>在这里，关系的力量会帮助你，因为欺骗两个人的心灵比欺骗一个人的心灵更难。在这里，你必须把一切都交给内识。问内识：”这是个好主意吗？” 问内识：”我应该听从这个人的建议吗？”也许你会感到抗拒；也许内识会保持沉默。这两种情况都表明，你应该停下来，不要继续做这个决定，也不要听从这个人的建议。</p>
<p>You must be patient. You must be observant. If you are frightened and panicked, you will do extreme and unwise things. You have to face great danger with courage and with as much objectivity as you can muster. This requires the power of Knowledge within yourself. And it requires the confidence that you can take action, that you can move your life in a positive direction and that you will not fall into the trap of easy assumptions or simple solutions, thinking you have an answer for everything.</p>
<p>你必须有耐心。你必须善于观察。如果你感到害怕和恐慌，你就会做出极端和不明智的事情。你必须勇敢地面对巨大的危险，并尽可能客观。这需要内识的力量。这需要你有信心，相信自己能够采取行动，相信自己能够让生活朝着积极的方向发展，相信自己不会落入简单假设或简单解决方案的陷阱，认为自己对一切都有答案。</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the risks and the power of the Great Waves. Many people will do this, thinking, “Oh, well, you just provide this new technology, and it’s not a problem” or “You just have people change their behavior in this one way, and everything is fine.” Others will say, “It is not really a big problem. It is all being invented by other people for their own profit or advantages.” You will hear a whole range of responses to the Great Waves of change. But only within yourself, in the depth of your experience, will you know, and if you listen carefully, you will see who amongst others is wise and who is unwise.</p>
<p>不要低估变革巨浪的风险和力量。许多人会这样做，认为”哦，好吧，你只需提供这种新技术，就不会再有问题”，或者”你只需让人们以这种方式改变他们的行为，就万事大吉了”。还有人会说：”这其实不是什么大问题。这都是其他人为了自己的利益或好处而发明的”。你会听到一系列对变革巨浪的回应。但是，只有在你自己的内心深处，在你的经验深处，你才会知道，如果你认真倾听，你就会知道在其他人当中，谁是明智的，谁是不明智的。</p>
<p>One should never underestimate adversity when entering into changing circumstances. That is basic wisdom regarding living in physical reality. Many people do this, of course. Some people do this in facing anything and everything. But for you, you must gain a greater strength, a greater confidence and with it a greater patience. You have to follow the steps. You cannot simply have big answers. Big answers will not be true answers. Everything has to be tried and proven. You do not climb a great mountain in one giant leap. You have to prepare yourself and your provisions, and you have to take the long journey and build strength and wisdom as you go.</p>
<p>在不断变化的环境中，人们永远不应该低估逆境。这是生活在物理现实中的基本智慧。当然，许多人都是这样做的。有些人在面对任何事情时都会这样做。但对你来说，你必须获得更大的力量、更强的信心和更大的耐心。你必须遵循内识的进阶。你不能简单地拥有大的答案。大的答案不会是真正的答案。一切都必须经过试验和验证。攀登高峰不是一蹴而就的。你必须准备好你自己和你的供给，你必须走一段漫长的旅程，在前进的过程中积累力量和智慧。</p>
<p>Do not worry that others are not doing this. Do not worry that the general population seems asleep and falsely self-assured. You yourself must prepare. Against all odds, you must prepare. Against the discouragement you will see in observing others, you must still prepare. You prepare because you must—not because everyone is doing it, not because the experts have told you that you must do it. Even most of the experts do not know what is coming and are not responding appropriately.</p>
<p>不要担心其他人没有这样做。不要担心普通人似乎都在沉睡和虚假地自我安慰。你自己必须做好准备。面对所有的困难，你必须做好准备。尽管你在观察他人时会看到沮丧的情绪，但你仍然必须做好准备。你必须做好准备，因为你必须这样做，而不是因为大家都在这样做，也不是因为专家告诉你必须这样做。即使是大多数专家也不知道即将发生什么，也没有做出适当的反应。</p>
<p>You are being given a gift of love here. If you can appreciate the problem, you will see the value of the answer. If you can recognize the great challenge coming now, you will appreciate the gift of preparation. You will not see it as an inconvenience. You will not think of it in a negative way. You will not deny it, repudiate it or think it is too extreme. In fact, it is quite appropriate in the face of the Great Waves.</p>
<p>你在这里得到的是一份爱的礼物。如果你能欣赏这个问题，你就会看到答案的价值。如果你能认识到现在即将到来的巨大挑战，你就会感激准备工作的礼物。你就不会把它视为不便。你不会以消极的方式看待它。你不会否认它、否定它，也不会认为它过于极端。事实上，面对变革的巨浪，这是非常恰当的。</p>
<p>This preparation will redeem you. It will free you from your own self-obsession, your own weaknesses, your own foolishness and your own preoccupations. It will require you to respond to life and to the world and to reality. You will find you have strength you did not know you had before. If you take action, you will realize that you have this strength and can build this strength. If you reach out to others, you will find that others have strength and you will need their strength as well, as they will need yours.</p>
<p>这种准备将救赎你。它将把你从自我迷恋、自身弱点、愚昧和斤斤计较中解放出来。它将要求你对生命、世界和现实做出回应。你会发现自己拥有了以前不知道的力量。如果你采取了行动，你就会发现自己拥有这种力量，并且能够增强这种力量。如果你向他人伸出援手，你会发现他人也拥有力量，你需要他们的力量，他们也需要你的力量。</p>
<p>This will be life affirming, for people were meant to function together in harmony. People do not do well when they are living in isolation, whether it be geographical isolation, social isolation or psychological isolation. People wither and shrink in isolation, but become stronger in functioning together for a greater purpose. Now you have a greater purpose. You do not have to wonder now, “Who am I, why am I in the world, and what am I really here to do?” because life is telling you what you must do, and Knowledge within you is urging you to respond. You are freed from endless deliberation, self-questioning, self-evaluation and self-obsession, for now you must respond to the world.</p>
<p>这将是对生命的肯定，因为人们本应和谐相处。当人们生活在与世隔绝的环境中时，无论是地理上的隔绝、社会上的隔绝还是心理上的隔绝，都不会有好的结果。人在与世隔绝的环境中会枯萎、萎缩，但在为一个更大目的而共同运作时，人们却会变得更加强大。现在，你有了一个更大的目的。你现在不必再怀疑：”我是谁，我为什么来到这个世界，我来这里到底是为了做什么？”因为生命正在告诉你必须做什么，你的内识正在敦促你做出回应。你从无休止的思考、自我质疑、自我评价和自我迷恋中解脱出来，因为现在你必须对世界做出回应。</p>
<p>It will take time to gain certain information that you will need, but it must lead to wise and constructive action. You must prepare before the Great Waves come. You must prepare before others realize what is happening. You are being given this early warning. It is a blessing of unparalleled value and importance for you.</p>
<p>内识将需要时间来获取你所需的某些信息，但这些信息必须引导你采取明智和建设性的行动。在变革巨浪来临之前，你必须做好准备。你必须在其他人意识到变革巨浪之前做好准备。我们正在向你发出预警。这对你来说是无比珍贵和重要的祝福。</p>
<p>Rethink your life—your relationship with where you live, the house you live in, your work, your transportation, your relationships. Who is wise amongst those whom you know? Who has skills? Who is strong? Who can face the Great Waves of change? Learn what the resources of your community are. What can they provide? What assets do they really have that can support you and your community?</p>
<p>重新思考你的生活——你与居住地的关系，你居住的房子，你的工作，你的交通工具，你的人际关系。在你知道的人中，谁是明智的？谁具备技能？谁是强者？谁能面对变革的巨浪？了解你所在社区的资源。它们能提供什么？它们真正拥有哪些资产可以支持你和你的社区？</p>
<p>The work is immense. It is necessary. And now is the time. There is no more time for just foolish consideration, thinking about the problem. And it is not appropriate to simply be frightened and do nothing. If you act, you will become stronger and more confident. If you do not act, you will become weaker and less confident. Action is necessary. There is so much to do, and now is the time to take this action.</p>
<p>这项工作是巨大的。它是必要的。而现在是时候了。没有更多的时间仅仅是愚蠢的考虑，思考这个问题。仅仅感到害怕而什么也不做是不合适的。如果你采取行动，你就会变得更加强大并拥有更大的自信。如果你不采取行动，你会变得更加虚弱，更没有信心。行动是必要的。有许多事情要做，而现在正是采取这种行动的时间。</p>
<p>It is as if your nation were going to enter a great war that will decide the fate of the world. You must think of the Great Waves like this, except now you are going to be at war with the world, with the conditions of the world that have largely been created by humanity’s overuse and abuse of the world’s resources and environment. It is going to war with the circumstances you have created, circumstances that can now defeat you and overwhelm you.</p>
<p>就好像你的国家要进入一场决定世界命运的大战一样。你必须这样思考变革的巨浪，只不过现在你们将与世界开战，与主要由人类过度使用和滥用世界资源和环境所造成的世界状况开战。它将与你们所创造的环境开战，这些环境现在可以打败你，压倒你。</p>
<p>You must think of it in a big way, or you will diminish it because you are afraid. You will diminish it because you are not confident. You will diminish it because everyone else is diminishing the risk. You will fall back into complacency and false self-assurance, re-engaging with your former interests and priorities. You were awake for a few minutes. You were alerted, but then you fell back into a state of slumber—sleeping now, unaware, unprepared and assured that everything will be taken care of for you by someone, somewhere, somehow.</p>
<p>你必须以大局为重，否则你会因为害怕而削弱它。你会因为不自信而降低风险。你会因为其他人都在降低风险而减少它。你会重新陷入自满和虚假的自我保证，重新参与你以前的兴趣和优先事项。你有几分钟是清醒的。你被惊醒了，但随后你又陷入了沉睡状态——现在正在沉睡，毫无察觉，毫无准备，并确信一切都会由某人、某地、以某种方式为你解决。</p>
<p>This is the weakness of humanity. It has lost its strength, its awareness and its response to nature—living in insulation, living in affluence, living on self-assurance. The wealth and splendor that were created in the last century will diminish and decline in this century—decline rapidly, as if a great balloon were deflating, so vulnerable it was from being punctured by so many things.</p>
<p>这就是人类的弱点。它已经失去了它的力量，它的觉知，它对自然的回应——生活在隔离中，生活在富裕中，生活在自我肯定中。上个世纪创造的财富和辉煌将在本世纪减少和衰退——急剧下降，就像一个巨大的气球正在泄气，因为被这么多东西刺穿，它是如此脆弱。</p>
<p>You must adjust and adapt. That is being intelligent. To deny this is not being intelligent. Living in isolation is not intelligent. There are very few people who will be able to survive in isolation, but they will have to have immense skills and will have to live a life of continued hardship. This would only work for a very, very unique set of individuals. For everyone else, which is nearly everyone else, there will have to be greater human cooperation and a very careful use of resources.</p>
<p>你必须调整和适应。这就是智能。否认这一点就不是明智之举。与世隔绝的生活并不智能。只有极少数人能够在与世隔绝的环境中生存，但他们必须拥有高超的技能，而且必须过着持续艰苦的生活。这种生活可能只适用于极为独特的一小部分人群。对于几乎所有其他人来说，需要更大程度的人类合作和非常谨慎地使用资源。</p>
<p>The whole human landscape will have to be redesigned over time so that people can function and live under a very different set of circumstances in a world in decline. In the future, whole cities will be abandoned due to the heating of the world. If you live in a city like this now, you must consider relocation. Whole regions of the world will become so arid that almost no one will be able to live there. They will have to move. Where should they go? What should they do? And who would receive them?</p>
<p>人类整体环境将随着时间重新设计，以便在一个日益衰退的世界中人们能够生存和生活。将来，整个城市会因为全球变暖而被废弃。如果你现在生活在这样的城市中，你必须考虑搬迁。世界上的整个地区将变得如此干旱，几乎没有人能够在这里生活。他们将不得不搬迁。他们应该去哪里？他们应该做什么？谁会接收他们？</p>
<p>You cannot answer these questions. You do not have an answer for these questions. But you have a journey to take. You have a preparation to make. You have a pathway to follow. You were always meant to have this preparation, this journey and this pathway. Now is the time that you must begin and proceed. You cannot control the outcome for the world, but you can build greater stability for yourself and for other people, and this is important. This is within the realm of your responsibility and capability, and this is what you must do now.</p>
<p>你无法回答这些问题。你对这些问题没有答案。但你有一段旅程要走。你需要做好准备。你有一条道路要走。你一直注定要进行这种准备，这段旅程和这种道路。现在是你必须开始并继续前进的时间。你无法控制世界的结果，但你可以为自己和他人建立更大的稳定性，这一点很重要。这在你的责任和能力范围之内，也是你现在必须要做的。</p>
