</blockquote>
<p>To come to terms with the deeper meaning of your life, the greater purpose of your life, there must be a deep evaluation, and this evaluation will be ongoing. It is fundamentally an evaluation regarding relationships. But I use the word relationship here in a more complete sense, for everything that you are associated with represents a relationship—your possessions, your home, your employment, the world itself, the change that is occurring within the world, the nation in which you live and many other things as well. They all represent relationship.</p>
<p>为了理解你生命的深层意义，你生命的更伟大目的，就必须进行深刻的评估，而这种评估将是持续性的。从根本上说，这是一次关于关系的评估。但我在这里使用关系这个词的意义更完整，因为与你有关的一切都代表着一种关系——你的财产、你的家、你的工作、世界本身、世界正在发生的变化、你生活的国家以及许多其他事物。它们都代表着关系。</p>
<p>This is a very important way of looking at your involvement in the world, for it gives you a very clear pathway to follow in discerning what is valuable and what is not, what is helpful and what is a hindrance, what will be needed in the future and what will hold you back. Your relationships are not just with people, but with places, with things, with events, with nations and with the whole world itself.</p>
<p>这是看待你参与世界的一个非常重要的方式，因为它为你提供了一个非常清晰的途径，让你辨别什么是有价值的，什么是没有价值的，什么是有帮助的，什么是有阻碍的，什么是未来需要的，什么是会阻碍你的。你的关系不仅仅是与人的关系，还包括与地方、与事物、与事件、与国家以及与整个世界它本身的关系。</p>
<p>People often do not think of things in the context of relationships, so this is perhaps a new way of looking at the world around you. Its value is that it gives you a very clear discernment, for what works in relationships in one arena can translate into other areas as well. If you have a harmful relationship with your work, for example, it will generate many of the same difficulties and impedance in your life as a difficult relationship with a person. If you have a difficult relationship with your home, it will hold you back. It will limit your possibilities.</p>
<p>人们通常不会从关系的角度来思考问题，所以这也许是看待你周围世界的一种新方式。它的价值在于，它能让你有一个非常清晰的辨别力，因为在一个领域的关系中起作用的关系也可以转化到其他领域。例如，如果你与你的工作有一种有害的关系，那它就会像与人的关系有害一样，给你的生活带来许多困难和和障碍。如果你与你的家庭有困难的关系，它也会阻碍你的发展。它会限制你的可能性。</p>
<p>You even have a relationship with the future. This is true because you are sent into the world to serve the world as it undergoes the beginning period of great change. You have a relationship with the future. You have a relationship with the past, or with your evaluation of the past, to be more precise.</p>
<p>你甚至与未来也有关系。这是真实的，因为你被派遣来到这个世界上，为这个正在经历变革的世界服务。你与未来有一种关系。你与过去也有一种关系，或者更准确地说，你与你对过去的评价有关系。</p>
<p>The condition of your life, then, as a whole represents the condition of all these relationships. And you have no neutral relationships, for every one of them is either helping you or hindering you and holding you back. You are either gaining strength or losing strength in every one of these relationships. Certainly, some are more important and potent than others, but they all have a bearing on your life.</p>
<p>因此，你的生命状况作为一个整体，就代表了所有这些关系的状况。你没有中立的关系，因为每一种关系要么在帮助你，要么在阻碍你、使你退步。在每一种关系中，你要么获得力量，要么失去力量。当然，有些关系比其他关系更重要、更有效力，但它们都与你的生命息息相关。</p>
<p>So the deep evaluation is really an evaluation of what you are giving your life to and what you are assigning in life to be your chief influences, for every relationship represents an influence. The power of influence is very significant, but most people are not aware of this or its consequences. Certainly, you can recognize that the person you are married to would have a great influence over you, perhaps the chief influence in your life. But people rarely think, in terms of marriage or partnership, that the other person would become the chief influence in their lives. If this criterion were added to the evaluation of the other person in their relationship and the possibilities for union and partnership with another person, perhaps you would have a very different outcome than what you see in the world today.</p>
<p>因此，深入的评估实际上是评估你把你的生命交给内识，以及你在生命中把内识指定为你的主要影响因素，因为每一种关系都代表一种影响。影响的力量是非常重大的，但大多数人并没有察觉到这一点或看到它的后果。当然，你可以识别到，与你结婚的人对你有很大的影响，也许是你生命中的主要影响。但人们很少想到，就婚姻或伙伴关系而言，人们很少会想到对方会成为自己生命中的主要影响者。如果在评估对方的关系以及与另一个人结合和建立伙伴关系的可能性时加入这个标准，也许你会看见一个截然不同的结果，而不是你在当今世界上看到的这样。</p>
<p>So think for a moment in terms of everything being a relationship. You have a relationship with people, places, things, events, the past, the future, world events and your nation. You even have a relationship with the Greater Community of intelligent life in the Universe, though it is unlikely that you have discovered what this means to you yet and how important it will be for your future.</p>
<p>因此，请思考一下，世间万物都是一种关系。你与人、地方、事物、事件、过去、未来、世界事件和你的国家都有关系。你甚至与宇宙中的智能生命大社区也有关系，尽管你可能还没有发现这对你意味着什么，以及它对你的未来有多重要。</p>
<p>The next thing to consider is that each of these relationships represents an influence. Each influences you, and you influence them. You have power in the world in this regard, and the world has power over you. The power moves in both directions. And this power gives you the power of decision, which can be applied to more circumstances than you are yet aware of. This power of decision is fundamental to your success and to your future in a world that will be impacted by the Great Waves of change—by environmental destruction, by the decline of your fundamental resources, by a change in the world’s climate, by ever-increasing economic and political instability and the great risk of war and conflict that this will produce.</p>
<p>接下来要思考的是，每一种关系都代表着一种影响。每个人都影响着你，而你也影响着他们。在这方面，你在世界上拥有力量，而世界也对你拥有力量。这种力量是双向的。而这种力量给了你决定的力量，它可以应用于你尚未察觉的更多关系。在这个世界上，你的成功和未来都将受到变革巨浪的影响——环境的破坏、基本资源的减少、世界气候的变化、不断加剧的经济和政治不稳定，以及由此产生的战争和冲突的巨大风险。</p>
<p>The decisions that are important are the ones you make now, for there is time to prepare for the Great Waves of change. But time is of the essence. You do not have a great deal of time, for already the Great Waves of change are affecting the world. Yet here you stand with all of your relationships and all of their influences upon you.</p>
<p>重要的决定是你现在做出的决定，因为你还有时间为变革的巨浪做准备。但时间至关重要。你没有太多的准备时间，因为变革的巨浪已经在影响着整个世界。然而，你站在这里，面对着你所有的关系和它们对你的影响。</p>
<p>The great evaluation begins with taking stock of where you are now—how you spend your time, your energy, your focus and your interests. Where is your life being given away? What is it being focused upon? Where is it being assigned? You only have so much energy in the day, so much time in the day, so much space within your mind to consider things. Where is that all going now? What are you doing? Who are you with? What are your priorities? Where are you gaining energy in your life, and where are you losing it? And to whom are you losing it, and to what are you losing it? Where do you feel certainty, and where do you feel uncertain? What relationships are you in now that give you a sense of certainty and direction? And which relationships cloud that certainty or obstruct it completely?</p>
<p>伟大的评估从盘点你现在的位置开始——你如何花费你的时间、能量、注意力和你的兴趣。你的生命被浪费在哪里？生命的重点是什么？生命被分配到了哪里？你每天只有这么多的能量、这么多的时间、这么多的空间在你的心灵中考虑问题。现在这些都去哪儿了？你在做什么？你和谁在一起？你的优先事项是什么？你在生活中哪些地方获得了能量，哪些地方失去了能量？你的能量在向谁流失？你在哪里感到确定，又在哪里感到不确定？你现在所处的哪些关系给了你确定性和方向感？哪些关系使这种确定性蒙上了阴影或完全阻碍了它？</p>
<p>As you can see, there are many questions, and these are not all of them. That is why this deep evaluation takes time. It is not something you do in an hour as a process or an exercise. It is not something you spend a weekend thinking about. Instead, it is something you must give yourself to as one of the main priorities of your life, particularly at this time. This should be a major focus for you. For if you do not exercise your focus in this way, if you do not gain a greater discernment, you will not know what to do in the world today or tomorrow. And as the Great Waves of change come, your uncertainty and your vulnerability will increase significantly.</p>
<p>正如你所看到的，有许多问题，而这些并不是所有的问题。这就是为什么这种深度评估需要时间。它不是你在一个小时内就能完成的过程或练习。它也不是你花一个周末的时间就能完成的评估。相反，你必须把它作为你生活中的主要优先事项之一，特别是在这个时候。这应该成为你的主要关注点。因为如果你不以这种方式锻炼你的注意力，如果你不获得更大的辨别力，你将不知道今天或明天在这个世界上该做什么。而随着变革巨浪的到来，你的不确定性和你的脆弱性将大大增加。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must begin somewhere, and you must begin with where you are—not with what you want, or what you believe, or what you think will happen next, or your goals, or your ambitions or your dreams. Where are you right now? Who are you with, and what are you doing with them? What do you own, and is it giving you strength or taking strength away from you? What do you believe, and are your beliefs giving you clarity, or are they a replacement for Knowledge itself? Where is your time going? Where is your mind going? If you sit in meditation, what is concerning your mind? Where is your mind going? What problems is it solving?</p>
<p>因此，你必须从某个地方开始，必须从你现在的位置开始——而不是从你想要的地方开始，或你相信的地方，或你认为接下来会发生的地方，或你的目标，或你的野心或梦想开始。你现在在哪里？你和谁在一起，你和他们在做什么？你拥有什么，它是给你力量还是夺走你的力量？你相信什么，你的信仰是给你带来清晰的觉知，还是取代了内识它本身？你的时间到哪里去了？你的心灵在哪里？如果你静坐冥想，你的心灵在想什么？你的心灵去了哪里？它在解决什么问题？</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a very big task and confusing as well because it requires you to become objective about your life. And objectivity here is of central importance. Do not be swayed by the thought that you must be loving as opposed to being fearful, for that is all preferential thinking. It does not represent clarity of mind or real certainty at all. Do not fall into the trap of the dichotomy between being loving versus being fearful. The objective here is to see clearly. The real dichotomy is whether you have wisdom or not, whether you are responsible or not, whether you are preparing for the future or not and whether you are seeing what is coming over the horizon of your life or not.</p>
<p>显然，这是一项非常艰巨的任务，而且也很令人困惑，因为它要求你对自己的生命变得客观。而客观性在这里是至关重要的。不要被”你必须充满爱，而不是充满恐惧”的想法所左右，因为这都是偏好性思维。它根本不代表心灵的清晰或真正的确定性。不要落入爱与恐惧的二分法的陷阱中。这里的目标是要看的清晰。真正的二分法是你是否有拥有智慧，你是否拥有责任感，你是否为未来做好了准备，你是否看见你生命地平线上即将发生的一切。</p>
<p>Begin then with simple things. Review everything that you own. Everything that you own, even insignificant things, have a value to you of some kind and in a subtle way represent an influence. If your life is full of things that have no usefulness or purpose, then they are taking time and energy from you to a certain degree. You still own them, and so you are still in relationship with them. They are occupying space in your home and in your mind. Everything you own really either needs to be fundamentally practical and necessary or personally very meaningful, and that meaning must come in a way that supports who you are now and where you feel you are heading in life.</p>
<p>那就从简单的事情做起。回顾你所拥有的一切。你所拥有的一切，哪怕是微不足道的物品，对你来说都有某种价值，并在潜移默化中对你产生影响。如果你的生活中充满了毫无用处或没有目的的物品，那它们在一定程度上占用了你的时间和能量。你仍然拥有它们，所以你仍然与它们有关系。它们在你的家里和你的心灵中占据着空间。你所拥有的一切真的需要从根本上说是实用和必要的，或者是对你个人非常有意义的，而这种意义必须以一种支持你现在的身份和你人生目标方向的方式表现出来。</p>
<p>Things that represent old memories have an influence, drawing you backwards, when in fact you must be facing the future and learning how to live fully in the moment. It is easier to let go of things than to let go of people or to let go of security. So it is a place to begin. The process is one of sorting out, bringing a greater objectivity into your life—looking at every possession that you have and asking, “Is this really useful to me? Is it personally meaningful to me? And does it enhance and strengthen my awareness and understanding of myself?”</p>
<p>代表旧记忆的物品会影响你，使你向后退，而事实上你必须面对未来，学习如何完全活在当下。放下物品比放下人或放下安全感更容易。因此，这是一个开始的地方。这个过程是一个整理的过程，为你的生命带来更大的客观性——审视你所拥有的每一件物品，然后问：”这对我真的有用吗？它对我个人有意义吗？它能提高和加强我对自己的觉知和理解吗？”</p>
<p>You will find that your life is cluttered, that things are weighing you down and that there are a lot of old things in your life that perhaps you never think about. But, in reality, they are having an influence over you. As you let them go, you feel lighter and better, and somehow over time your mind becomes clearer. This is a good place to start. It is not very challenging, but it is a beginning step in developing discernment—discernment in relationships—for everything you do, everything you own, and everything you are associated with represents relationships. All of these relationships have an influence upon you—upon your awareness, your decisions and the direction that you know you must follow.</p>
<p>你会发现自己的生命变得杂乱无章，很多事情让你不堪重负，生命中有很多陈年旧事，也许你从未想过。但实际上，它们对你产生了影响。当你放下它们时，你会感到轻松和愉快，随着时间的推移，你的心灵也会变得更加清晰。这是一个很好的开始。这并不十分具有挑战性，但却能培养辨别力——对关系的辨别力——因为你所做的一切、你所拥有的一切、你所与之相关的一切都代表着关系。所有这些关系都会对你产生影响——影响你的觉知、你的决定以及你知道自己必须遵循的方向。</p>
<p>Begin, then, to clear out your life, to simplify. You do not want to carry a lot of extra baggage into the future, for the future will be very uncertain in the face of the Great Waves of change. You want to be flexible, you want to be able to move easily, you do not want to be encumbered by lots of possessions. Here you must be very honest with yourself about what you own and what you do not own, what is meaningful and what is not meaningful.</p>
<p>因此，开始清理你的生活，简化你的生命。你不想带着许多额外的包袱走向未来，因为面对变革的巨浪，未来将是非常不确定的。你想要灵活，你想要能够轻松移动，你不想被大量的财产所束缚。在这里，你必须非常诚实地面对自己，你拥有什么，不拥有什么，什么是有意义的，什么是没有意义的。</p>
<p>At the level of Knowledge, it is very clear. It is either a yes or a no. Or in some cases, there will be neutrality. But regarding things that you own, that you possess and that you are responsible for, generally you will find there will be a yes or a no within yourself. This will make the decision making very easy, as long as you act upon it, putting away those things that you no longer need or should not own—to be given away or thrown away, whatever the case may require. This is a valuable exercise because you need to free your time and your energy for greater things. Here you are beginning with the simplest things, the simplest relationships, for you will have greater challenges as you proceed.</p>
<p>在内识的层面上，它是非常清晰的。要么是肯定的，要么是否定的，或者在某些情况下会保持中立。但关于你所拥有、你所占有并对之负责的物品，通常你会在心里有一个肯定或否定的答案。只要你付诸行动，将那些你不再需要或不应该拥有的物品放在一边——无论情况如何，要么给予他人，要么丢弃它。这是一个有价值的练习，因为你需要为更重要的事情释放时间和能量。你从最简单的事物、最简单的关系开始，这将使你在面对更大挑战时更加得心应手。</p>
<p>You are going to need a tremendous amount of energy in the future, and you must gather your resources together. You must gather your strength and build your focus. If your time and life are being spent mindlessly in all directions, you will not have the power to do this, for power here represents concentration. If your life is not focused and concentrated, then your energy is being lost in many different places. Now you must plug up the gaps. Now you must reclaim what is being lost. Now you must gather together all of your strength, for you will need it for the difficult times ahead. You will need it to override and overcome the other influences in your life that are dissuading you and holding you back from doing what you know you must do and from discerning a greater direction that Knowledge within you is attempting to provide for you as you go along.</p>
<p>你在未来将需要大量的能量，你必须把你的资源聚集起来。你必须聚集你的力量，建立你的焦点。如果你的时间和生命被无意识地花在各个方向上，你将没有力量去做这件事，因为力量在这里代表着集中。如果你的生命不集中，注意力不专注，那你的能量就会在许多不同的地方流失。现在你必须堵住这些缺口。现在你必须夺回正在失去的能量。现在你必须聚集你所有的力量，因为你在未来的困难时期将需要它。你将需要它来推翻和克服你生命中的其他影响，这些影响正在劝阻你，阻碍你去做你知道你必须做的事情，阻碍你去辨别你的内识在你前进的过程中试图为你提供的更大的方向。</p>
<p>This deep evaluation continues on to greater things: to your work, to your relationships, to your relationship with your body and to your relationship with your mind. Here it is more difficult to bring objectivity because you can identify with these things far more. Identifying with things means that you lose your objectivity regarding them. To review your work, to review your relationships and to review your relationship with your mind and your body, which represents your relationship with yourself, require a very great objectivity. But at the level of Knowledge, the response is fundamental.</p>
<p>这种深度的评估会延续到更大的关系：你的工作、你的人际关系、你与身体的关系以及你与心灵的关系。在这里，要做到客观就更加困难了，因为你可以更多地去认同这些关系。对关系的认同意味着你失去了对关系的客观性。回顾你的工作，回顾你的关系，回顾你与心灵和身体的关系，也就是你与自己的关系，都需要极大的客观性。但在内识层面上，回应是根本性的。</p>
<p>For example, in your relationships, you must review every one of them to see if they are helping you or hindering you, if the people you are involved with are moving forward in life. In some circumstances, in your employment for example, you may have to work with people regardless, but how you engage with them will make a big difference in the impact they will have upon your life.</p>
<p>例如，在你的关系中，你必须审查每一个关系，看看它们是在帮助你还是阻碍你，你所交往的人是否在生命中不断前进。在某些情况下，例如在你的工作中，你可能不得不与人合作，不管怎样，但你如何与他们打交道，将使他们对你的生命产生很大的影响。</p>
<p>Regarding relationships that you choose and select for yourself, you must evaluate each one: “Is this relationship strengthening me or weakening me? Is this person moving in the direction that I must move? Do we have a greater destiny together, or should I release this person to follow their own journey in life?”</p>
<p>关于你为自己选择的关系，你必须评估每一种关系。”这种关系是在加强我还是削弱我？这个人是否正朝着我必须前进的方向发展？我们在一起是否有更大的天命，还是我应该让这个人追随他自己的生命旅程？”</p>
<p>These are valuable questions. You must gain the strength, the courage and the objectivity to ask them and to act upon them. One person in your life can hold you back and alter the destiny and course of your life. You should never underestimate the power of influence in your relationships. Even if it is a casual friendship, this friendship is either helping you or hindering you in moving forward. As you begin to take steps in moving forward, you will see very soon if this friendship is helping you or hindering you, if the other person is questioning you, belittling you or doubting you in your efforts to focus your life and to prepare yourself for the future.</p>
<p>这些都是有价值的问题。你必须获得力量、勇气和客观性来提出这些问题并采取行动。你生命中的一个人可以阻碍你，改变你的天命和人生轨迹。你永远不应该低估关系中的影响力量。即使是偶然的友谊，这种友谊要么帮助你，要么阻碍你前进。当你开始迈出前进的步伐时，你很快就会看到这种友谊是在帮助你还是在阻碍你，如果对方在你努力专注于自己的生命并为未来做准备时质疑你、贬低你或怀疑你。</p>
<p>You will need strong companions. You cannot afford to have detractors in your life. You can learn from their challenges, but if you associate with them closely, you will lose ground to them.</p>
<p>你会需要强有力的同伴。你的生命中不能有诋毁者。你可以从他们的挑战中学习，但如果与他们过于亲近，你将会失去立足之地。</p>
<p>Here developing strength and discernment will take time and can be very difficult in certain circumstances, for there are people whose approval you think you must have. There are people you are still trying to impress. There are people who you think you need for safety, for security, for love or for pleasure. But at the level of Knowledge, it will be yes or no, for Knowledge is trying to take you somewhere, and everyone and everything in your life is either helping you or hindering you in discovering and following this direction.</p>
<p>在这里，培养力量和辨别力需要时间，在某些情况下可能会非常困难，因为有些人你认为你必须得到他们的认可。有些人你还在努力讨好他们。有些人你认为你需要他们的安全、保障、爱或快乐。但在内识的层面上，这将是“是”或“否”，因为内识正试图把你带到某个地方，而你生命中的每一个人、每一件事要么在帮助你，要么在阻碍你发现和追随这个方向。</p>
<p>Your employment either has a future or not in the face of the Great Waves of change. That is something that you can evaluate intellectually. Yet at the level of Knowledge, it is still a yes or a no. Perhaps you will need to stay in this employment for a time, to give you stability while you make other decisions and while you gain a greater certainty about where you must go and the next steps you must follow in your life. But do not overcommit yourself to a situation that has no future, that will not be able to exist in the great difficulties to come.</p>
<p>在变革的巨浪面前，你的工作要么有前途，要么没有前途。这是你可以从理智上评估的。然而，在内识的层面上，它仍然是一个是或否。也许你需要在这份工作中呆上一段时间，在你做出其他决定时，在你对你必须去的地方和你生命中必须遵循的下一步获得更大的确定性时，给你带来稳定。但是，不要把自己过度委身于一个没有未来、无法在未来的巨大困难中生存的境地。</p>
<p>Do not overcommit yourself to anyone or anything until you have fulfilled this deep evaluation. Do not make any great plans. Do not try to rechart the course of your life. Do not commit yourself in marriage or relationship until you have undertaken this deep evaluation over time.</p>
<p>在完成这项深度评估之前，不要对任何人或任何事做出过多承诺。不要制定任何伟大的计划。不要试图重新规划你的人生轨迹。在进行长期的深度评估之前，不要在婚姻或关系中做出承诺。</p>
<p>Do not give your life away before you know what your life is for and the direction that it must follow. If you will follow this, it will save you. For it is so easy to give your life away to others—to commit yourself to a line of work or to establish a set of circumstances that will prevent you from ever realizing and remembering your greater purpose for coming into the world.</p>
<p>在你还不知道你的生命是为了什么以及它必须遵循的方向之前，不要把你的生命交给别人。如果你能遵循这一点，它将拯救你。因为你很容易把自己的生命交给别人——把你自己投入到一个工作领域或建立一套环境，从而使你永远无法实现和记住你来到这个世界的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>People establish relationships casually, using very weak and temporary criteria. They do not realize the seriousness of their engagements and the impact that it has upon them. It is because they lack discernment. It is because they do not value their lives that they would give themselves away so easily and commit their time and energy without greater care, that they would be so careless with themselves.</p>
<p>人们随意地建立关系，使用非常薄弱和临时的标准。他们没有意识到交往的严肃性及其对自己的影响。这是因为他们缺乏辨别力。正是因为他们不珍惜自己的生命，才会如此轻易地把自己交给他人，才会不经意地投入自己的时间和能量，才会对自己如此漫不经心。</p>
<p>This is a very important part of the deep evaluation. You cannot follow your intellect in this, for there are always good reasons to give yourself to things that will never be valuable to you. There are always compelling reasons to give your life away to people or to circumstances that do not represent your destiny.</p>
<p>这是深度评估的一个非常重要的部分。在这一点上，你不能跟随你的理智，因为总是有很好的理由把自己交给那些对你永远没有价值的关系。总有令人信服的理由把你的生命交给那些不代表你天命的人或环境。</p>
<p>Then there are social forces that encourage you to marry before you are ready, to have a family before you are ready, to commit yourself to a career before you are ready. All the social forces—the forces from your family and the encouragement from your friends—so often lead you completely in the wrong direction for your life. Do not condemn your family and friends, for they do not know. But you must know. You must gain this Knowledge. And the Knowledge that God has given you makes this possible. Otherwise, you would become lost in the world and would never find your way.</p>
<p>还有一些社会力量鼓励你在你准备好之前就结婚，在你准备好之前就有一个家庭，在你准备好之前就把自己投入到事业之中。所有的社会力量——来自你家庭的力量和来自你朋友的鼓励——常常把你引向完全错误的人生方向。不要谴责你的家人和朋友，因为他们并不知道。但你必须知道。你必须获得这个内识。而上帝给你的内识使这成为可能。否则，你会在这个世界上迷失，永远找不到方向。</p>
<p>Your relationship with your mind and your body represents a very great teaching that the New Message provides. Your mental health and your physical health are important. But to deal with them effectively, you must bring the same objectivity to them. Of course, you identify with your mind and your body, even to the extent that you think that that is who you are. But your mind is not who you are, and your body is not who you are. Instead, they represent vehicles of expression—vehicles through which you can participate in the world, have an influence in the world and express yourself and communicate to others in the world.</p>
<p>你与你的心灵和身体的关系代表了新讯息所提供的一个非常重要的教导。你的心理健康和你的身体健康都很重要。但要有效地处理它们，你必须以同样的客观态度对待它们。当然，你认同你的心灵和身体，甚至你认为那就是你。但你的心灵不是你，你的身体也不是你。相反，它们代表着表达的载体——你可以通过它们参与世界、影响世界、表达自己并与世界上的其他人交流。</p>
<p>They are vehicles to take you somewhere, to take you through life in this world, to live at this time, to have an impact upon this time. They are vehicles. Therefore, you must care for them. You must cultivate them, and they must be able to enable you to fulfill your mission in the world. If your health is broken down, either mentally or physically, you will not be able to follow a greater purpose, and in most cases it will never be revealed to you because you are not ready to follow it.</p>
<p>它们是载体，带你到达某个地方，带你在这个世界上生活，在这个时间生活，对这个时间产生影响。它们是载体。因此，你必须爱护它们。你必须培养它们，它们必须能够使你完成你在这个世界上的使命。如果你的健康出现问题，无论是心理上还是身体上的，你将无法遵循一个更伟大的目的，在大多数情况下，它将永远不会向你揭示，因为你还没有准备好去追随它。</p>
<p>Getting your life in order, then, involves also addressing the needs for your health—your mental health and your physical health. The mind requires some structure. It requires enjoyment. It requires companionship. And it requires relief and rest. You are able to discern this through your activities, through the influences you bring into your home, through the media, through your relationships, through the books you read and the things that you think about.</p>
<p>因此，要让生命井然有序，还需要满足你的健康需求——心理健康和身体健康。心灵需要一些结构。它需要享受。它需要陪伴。它需要缓解和休息。你可以通过你的活动，通过你带入家中的影响，通过媒体，通过你的关系，通过你阅读的书籍和你思考的事情来理解这一点。</p>
<p>Most people have never developed any control over their minds. They are simply the unwitting slaves to whatever their mind wants to think about, and so they feel very helpless in this regard. But in the deep evaluation, which is a process of bringing clarity and objectivity into your life, you are able to gain greater and greater control over your mind and thinking by deciding what you will think about, what you will respond to, what you will listen to, what you will read, what will be in your home, what will be the focus of your activities and so forth. You must gain this control because if you do not control your mind, other people will. If you do not set a real direction in your life, other people will set the direction for you. This, indeed, is the tragic circumstance of most of the people in the world today, whether they be rich or poor.</p>
<p>大多数人从来没有控制过自己的心灵。他们只是不知不觉地成为自己心灵的奴隶，因此在这方面感到非常无助。但在深度评估中，这是一个让你的生命变得清晰和客观的过程，通过决定你将思考什么、你将回应什么、你将聆听什么、你将阅读什么、你将在你的家里拥有什么、什么将是你活动的重点等等，来获得对你的心灵和思维越来越大的控制。你必须获得这种控制权，因为如果你不控制自己的心灵，其他人就会控制它。如果你不为自己的生命确定真正的方向，其他人就会为你确定方向。这的确是当今世界上大多数人的悲惨处境，无论他们是富人还是穷人。</p>
<p>It is obvious that those who are greatly impoverished are slaves to their circumstances. But it is not so obvious that those who are more affluent, and even the very wealthy, are also slaves to their circumstances. Though they have great enjoyments and freedom of time, in the end they are as lost and as deprived as the poorest around them. They will not fare well in facing the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world. They have no advantage. Their wealth can be lost easily, and they will be the target of other people, who will prey upon them. And they will live in great fear and anxiety—afraid to lose what they have and afraid of everyone and everything that they believe can take away from them their pleasures, their freedoms or their opportunities.</p>
<p>显然，那些非常贫穷的人是环境的奴隶。但富裕的人，甚至是非常富有的人，也是环境的奴隶，这一点并不明显。尽管他们拥有极大的享受和时间上的自由，但归根结底，他们与周围最贫穷的人一样迷失和匮乏。在面对即将到来世界的变革巨浪时，他们的处境不会太好。他们没有任何优势。他们的财富很容易失去，他们会成为其他人的目标，而其他人会对他们进行掠夺。他们将生活在巨大的恐惧和焦虑之中——害怕失去他们所拥有的一切，害怕他们认为可以夺走他们的快乐、自由或机会的所有人和事。</p>
<p>This is the time, then, to recognize what is needed for your mind and what is needed for your body—very simply. Nothing complex here. If you are following Knowledge, nothing is complex here. You have simple guidelines, and you must adhere to them.</p>
<p>因此，现在是时候认识到你的心灵需要什么，你的身体需要什么——非常简单。没有什么是复杂的。如果你遵循内识，这里没有什么是复杂的。你有简单的准则，你必须遵守它们。</p>
<p>At the outset, regarding your deep evaluation, whether it be regarding your possessions, your relationships, your activities or your engagements, it will be important for you to create space in your life to let things go, to open up your life, to allow there to be space in your life without it being filled by something else. In doing so, you will see how much you have tried to gain certainty through your ownership of things, through your relationships, through your engagements and so forth. You will perhaps feel less certain about your life and more vulnerable, but this is a good thing, for this creates a space for a Greater Power to fill and the freedom for you to set a new course, which will bring new people and circumstances into your life. If your life is already filled to the brim, nothing new can come. There can be no new experiences, no new revelations, no new relationships, no new opportunities.</p>
<p>首先，关于你的深度评估，无论是关于你的财产、你的关系、你的活动还是你的约定，重要的是你要在生命中创造空间，让事情过去，让你的生命开放，让你的生命有空间，而不是被其他东西填满。在这样做的过程中，你会发现自己曾多少次试图通过对事物的所有权、通过你的关系、通过你的约定等等来获得确定性。也许你会觉得自己的生命不是确定性的，更容易受到伤害，但这是件好事，因为这创造了一个空间，让更大的力量来填补，让你可以自由地设定新的方向，这将给你的生命带来新的人和环境。如果你的生命已经被填满，就不会有新的东西出现。没有新的体验，没有新的启示，没有新的关系，没有新的机会。</p>
<p>So at the outset, the deep evaluation is a process of discernment and release. You are discerning what is really important and releasing that which is not important. You are changing your relationship with things, with people, with places and with engagements. In so doing, you are changing, on a subtle but increasingly powerful level, your relationship with your mind and your body. Here you are gaining strength and learning to become inner-directed rather than merely being outer-directed.</p>
<p>所以在一开始，深度评估是一个辨别和释放的过程。你正在辨别什么是真正重要的，释放那些不重要的。你正在改变你与事物、与人、与地点和与约定的关系。在这样做的过程中，你也在微妙但日益强大的层面上改变着你与心灵和身体的关系。在这里，你正在获得力量，学习成为内在的指导者，而不仅仅是外在的指导者。</p>
<p>Many people ask, “Well, what shall I do in the face of the Great Waves of change?” Begin with this deep evaluation. That is fundamental. If this is not undertaken, you will not be free to know, you will not be free to act and you will not be free to move with Knowledge. You will be held in place, as if you were chained to a wall—unable to move, unable to reconsider your life and unable to set a new direction. For your life will already have been committed away, given over to others, or just simply lost in the countless thoughts and pursuits that you carry on in the course of your life.</p>
<p>许多人问道：”面对巨浪般的变革，我应该怎么做？首先要进行深度评估。这是最基本的。如果不这样做，你就无法自由地知道，无法自由地行动，也无法自由地随内识而动。你会像被铁链锁住一样固守原地——无法动弹，无法重新考虑你的生命，无法确定新的方向。因为你的生命早已被你的心灵和追求所占据，你的生命早已被他人所占据，因为你的生命已经被托付给他人，或者只是迷失在你一生中进行的无数感想以及追求之中。</p>
<p>You begin with the deep evaluation, and this evaluation continues. It is ongoing because bringing clarity, simplicity and focus to your life is ongoing. You do not do it all at once. It is ongoing. Everything around you wants to encumber you even more with possessions, with people, with places, with opportunities, with distractions, with stimulation and so forth. And so this discernment continues on because you must keep your life open, clear and uncluttered. Your life must be filled with people, places and things that strengthen you, that encourage you and that are symbolic that you have the strength and the responsibility to live fully in the moment and to prepare for the future in a way that is wise and effective.</p>
<p>你从深度评估开始，这种评估会一直持续下去。这是持续性的，因为让你的生命变得清晰、简单和专注是持续性的。你不可能一下子就做到。它是持续性的。你周围的一切都想用财产、人、地方、机会、分心、刺激等等来增加你的负担。因此，这种辨别仍在继续，因为你必须让自己的生命保持开放、清晰和整洁。你的生命必须充满强化你、鼓励你的人、地方和事物，它们象征着你有力量和责任充分活在当下，并以明智和有效的方式为未来做准备。</p>
<p>Here you will have to learn to say no to many things: no even to your own mind; no to your compulsions; no to your addictions; no to those pleasures that hurt your mind and your body; no to people who want you to do what they want you to do; no to opportunities that look good, but which, at a deeper level, you cannot accept; no to the consensus of people around you; no you will not follow their advice; no you will not join their group; no you will not accept their perception of reality. You do this not with anger or condemnation, not with fear of rejection, but with simple honesty and simple clarity.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须学会对许多事情说不：甚至对你自己的心灵说不；对你的强迫症说不；对你的成瘾说不；对那些伤害你身心的享乐说不；对那些想让你做他们想让你做的事情的人说不；对那些看起来不错，但在更深层面上你无法接受的机会说不；对你周围人的共识说不；你不会听从他们的建议；你不会加入他们的团体；你不会接受他们对现实的看法。你这样做不是因为愤怒或谴责，不是因为害怕被拒绝，而是因为简单的诚实和简单的清晰。</p>
<p>Do not be angry that the world is full of deception and full of dishonesty because it is a world without Knowledge. People have not found God’s great gift yet, and so they act foolishly, mimicking one another, following whatever their social conditioning tells them they must follow—following their friends, their groups, their leaders, their religions—everything. For without Knowledge, what else could they do but follow everything that is a substitute for Knowledge?</p>
<p>不要因为这个世界充满了欺骗和不诚实而生气，因为这是一个没有内识的世界。人们还没有发现上帝的伟大礼物，所以他们表现得很愚蠢，互相模仿，追随他们的社会条件告诉他们必须追随的一切——追随他们的朋友、他们的团体、他们的领袖、他们的宗教——一切。因为没有内识，他们除了追随替代内识的一切，他们还能做什么呢？</p>
<p>This should not be a source of anger for you if you are seeing it clearly. It is tragic, yes. It is greatly unfortunate, yes. But you cannot afford to be a critic of the world now.</p>
<p>如果你能清楚地看到这一点，这不应该成为你愤怒的源头。这是悲剧，没错。这是非常不幸的，没错。但现在你不能扮演世界的批评家。</p>
<p>Instead of condemning others, condemning the governments, condemning the world, condemning life, you must draw your resources to you. All of that condemnation represents a huge loss of energy, a loss of energy that only adds more friction and complaint to life, without any positive benefit. If your life is not moving with Knowledge, then your position as a critic is pointless and self-defeating. This is part of the conservation of your energy.</p>
<p>与其谴责他人、谴责政府、谴责世界、谴责生命，你必须把资源引向自己。所有的谴责都代表着巨大的能量损失，这种能量损失只会给生命增加更多的摩擦和抱怨，却没有任何积极的益处。如果你的生命没有与内识一起前进，那你作为批评者的立场就是毫无意义的，也是自取灭亡。这是能量守恒的一部分。</p>
<p>In the end, the great evaluation returns strength to you, connects you with Knowledge and conserves your energy. Perhaps you do not yet see the value of conserving your energy, for you want every moment of your life to be filled with pleasant stimulation, with meaningful activities, with enjoyable people. You want to fill up the space, but you need to open up the space, allowing it to be empty, holding it in reserve. For it is only in this space that new realizations come to you and that you are able to see things you could not see before, to know things you could not know before, to discern things that were beyond your reach before. New people and new opportunities come into your life because there is a space for them. So, in essence, your life must always have this space and this openness. It should never be filled up. And if it does become filled up, then it is time to let things go once again.</p>
<p>最终，深刻的评估会为你重拾力量，将你与内识联系起来，并保存你的能量。也许你还没有意识到保存能量的价值，因为你希望生命的每一刻都充满愉悦的刺激、有意义的活动和令人愉快的人。你想填满这个空间，但你需要打开这个空间，让它保持空旷，留有余地。因为只有在这样的空间中，新的领悟才会到来，你才能看到以前看不到的事物，理解以前不知道的关系，辨别以前无法触及的关系。新的人和新的机会进入你的生命，因为你的生命有了容纳他们的空间。因此，从本质上讲，你的生命必须始终保持这种空间性和开放性。它永远不应该被填满。如果它确实被填满了，那是时候再次放手了。</p>
<p>Even if your life were completely engaged appropriately, even if you were living The Way of Knowledge, even if every person in your life were meaningful to you and were a proponent of Knowledge within you and for you, you would still have to create an opening—this space in your life where nothing exists, where there is emptiness. It is this emptiness that allows you to be still, allows you to listen, allows you to look, allows you to really be with another person, to really experience a place and to enjoy the magnificence of nature. It is this space, this emptiness, this silence that allow you to discern the signs of the world and the movement of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>即使你的生命是完全投入的，即使你生活在内识之路上，即使你生活中的每个人对你来说都是有意义的，都是内识的支持者，你仍然必须在生命中创造一个开放的空间，在这里什么都不存在，这里是空虚的。正是这种空虚使你能够静止，使你能够倾听，使你能够观察，使你能够真正地与他人在一起，真正地体验一个地方，享受大自然的壮丽。正是这种空间、这种空虚、这种静止，使你能够辨别世界的迹象和自己内心的内识运动。</p>
<p>Instead of trying to fill up the space, you want to create the space and maintain a part of your life as open, unexplained and mysterious. Nothing is going on there. It is this that allows you to have wonder and reverence towards life, to have a pure experience instead of something that simply stimulates your thinking. It creates the opportunity for you to experience yourself outside of time and place—the experience of Grace, the experience of your Unseen Teachers, who are helping you to regain your connection with Knowledge and with it your greater purpose for coming into the world.</p>
<p>与其试图填满空间，不如创造空间，保持你生命的一部分是开放的、无法解释的和神秘的。这里什么也没有发生。正是这一点使你能够对生命产生好奇与敬畏，拥有纯粹的经历，而不是简单地刺激你的思考。它为你创造了在时间和地点之外体验你自己的机会——恩典的体验，你对不可见老师的体验，他们正在帮助你重新获得与内识的连接，并随之获得你来到世界的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You can imagine here that if you followed this through, your home would have very few things in it, but everything in it would be very valuable. Your personal life would have very few people in it, but every person would be really valuable. Your time would not be filled up, but would have openings in it for new experiences to happen. And your mind would not be constantly stimulated, but would be able to become quiet, observant and sensitive—seeing, hearing, recognizing things.</p>
<p>在这里，你可以想象一下，如果你坚持这样做，你家里的物品会很少，但里面的每一样物品都会非常有价值。在你的个人生活中只有很少的人，但每个人都会非常有价值。你的时间不会被填满，但会有新的经历发生。你的心灵不会被不断地刺激，而是能够变得安静、善于观察以及变得敏感——看见、听见并认识到关系。</p>
<p>It is like you are going in the opposite direction from the majority of people around you, who are all about acquiring things for themselves—possessions, people, experiences, sensations, stimulation—to the point where they have no idea who they are. Their life is filled up with external stimulation. They have no sense of where they are in life, where they are going or where the world is going. They are simply being swept away by all of their obsessions.</p>
<p>这就好像你正在朝着与你周围大多数人相反的方向前进，他们都在为自己获取东西——财产、人、经历、感觉、刺激，以至于他们根本不知道自己是谁。他们的生命充满了外部刺激。他们不知道自己的生命在哪里，不知道自己要去哪里，也不知道世界要去哪里。他们只是被所有的迷恋所淹没。</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, as a result of this deep evaluation, that your life becomes simple and clear and that you are able to discern opportunities at a more fundamental level—not whether they are pleasing and exciting, but whether they are truly meaningful and whether they serve your purpose or distract you from it.</p>
<p>因此，你可以想象，作为这种深度评估的结果，你的生命会变得简单而清晰，你能够在更基本的层面上辨别机会——不是机会是否令人愉悦和兴奋，而是机会是否真正有意义，是服务于你的目的，还是分散你的注意力。</p>
<p>You will certainly be able to have simple pleasures along the way, but anything that requires a more serious engagement—a new relationship, an important possession, an opportunity in your work, a new interest—these things must really be discerned because the whole world wants you to fill yourself up, while you, in essence, are trying to empty yourself out. This is why you must have very limited exposure to the media, only looking for those things that are important regarding the Great Waves of change or in some cases that are important in your immediate circumstances and environment.</p>
<p>一路上，你当然可以享受简单的快乐，但任何需要更认真参与的事情——新的关系、重要的财产、工作中的机遇、新的兴趣——这些事情都必须真正加以辨别，因为整个世界都希望你把自己填满，而你，实质上，是想把自己掏空。这就是为什么你必须非常有限度地接触媒体，只寻找那些与变革巨浪有关的重要事情，或者在某些情况下，那些对你眼前的情况和环境很重要的事情。</p>
<p>You should not be stimulated by the world. You are going to have to maintain some distance now if you are ever to have a hope of gaining your strength, building your discernment, cultivating your discretion and learning to become really observant—really being able to see what you need to see in yourself and in others. You cannot do this if you are running around like a crazy person—driven by your needs and desires and obligations to others. That is why the deep evaluation must happen at the outset if you are to have any chance of success. And this evaluation will continue, for there are thresholds that you must evaluate for yourself.</p>
<p>你不应该受到世俗的刺激。你现在必须保持一定的距离，这样你才有希望获得力量，培养自己的辨别力，培养自己的谨慎，学习成为真正的观察者——真正能够看到你需要在自己和他人身上看到的内识。如果你被自己的需要、欲望和对他人的义务所驱使，像个疯子一样到处乱跑，你就无法做到这一点。这就是为什么如果你想获得成功，就必须在一开始就进行深入评估的原因。而且，这种评估还将继续下去，因为有一些门槛是你必须为自己评估的。</p>
<p>Part of this you will undertake on your own, and part of it will be assisted by other people. The quality of your relationships now will become ever more important to you as you recognize that each relationship is significant in its influence upon you—whether it supports the emergence of Knowledge within you or whether it distracts you from this emergence, whether it encourages your preparation for the Great Waves of change or whether it discourages this preparation. Your relationships here are of the greatest importance, and this importance will grow over time.</p>
<p>其中一部分将由你自己完成，另一部分将由其他人协助完成。你现在的关系质量对你来说将变得越来越重要，因为你认识到，每一种关系都会对你产生重大影响——无论它是支持你内识的崛起，还是分散你对这种崛起的注意力；无论它是鼓励你为变革的巨浪做好准备，还是阻碍这种准备。你在这里的关系是最重要的，而且这种重要性会随着时间的推移而增加。</p>
<p>As you proceed, then, your life will have greater resources of energy. You will be able to undertake significant change in your life—change that you could not undertake before because you did not have the strength to do it. You did not have the potency within yourself to carry it through. Before, you saw things you knew you needed to do, but you did not have the strength to do them. You could not override your own mind or the opinions of others. You were just not strong enough to do it. Now you can do it, and it is giving your life greater flow and greater movement.</p>
<p>这样一来，你的生命就会拥有更多的能量资源。你将能够在你的生命中进行重大的改变以前你无法进行的改变，因为你没有力量去做。你的内心没有力量去完成它。以前，你看到一些你知道需要做的事情，但你没有力量去做。你无法超越你自己的心灵或他人的意见。你只是没有足够的力量去做。现在，你可以做到，而且它给你的生命带来了更大的流动和更大的运动。</p>
<p>Can you imagine that everything in your life represents your greater purpose in the world, the greater meaning of your life and that this has given you enough strength that you can deal with adversity now? It does not defeat you. You can deal with others disagreeing with you or criticizing you without losing yourself to their viewpoints.</p>
<p>你能否想象，你生命中的一切都代表着你在这个世界上的更伟大目的，你生命的更大意义，而这给了你足够的力量，让你现在可以应对逆境？它不会打败你。你可以面对其他人对你的不同意见或批评，而不会被他们的观点所迷惑。</p>
<p>This is a source of fulfillment and joy in your life. It is like you have been reclaimed. You have reclaimed yourself, and you have allowed others to come into your life who support that reclamation, which is fundamentally the reclamation of Knowledge.</p>
<p>这是你生命中充实和快乐的源泉。这就像你被开垦了一样。你已经开垦了自己，而且你允许其他人进入你的生命，他们支持这种开垦，从根本上说，这就是对内识的开垦。</p>
<p>Along the way, you have gained skills that you can now use to assist others, for they too must begin the deep evaluation. They too must learn how to gain their own strength and to reclaim their lives, which had been given away before without thought or consideration. The tools that you gain, the strength that you gain, the skills that you employ all become resources for assisting others in the future, and you will do this naturally, spontaneously. Even your life will be a demonstration of this, which will inspire and confuse other people.</p>
<p>一路走来，你已经获得了一些技能，现在可以用来帮助其他人，因为他们也必须开始深度评估。他们也必须学会如何获得自己的力量，如何重新找回自己的生命，而这些之前都是不经意或不经考虑就被放弃的。你所获得的工具、你所获得的力量、你所运用的技能都会成为未来协助他人的资源，你将自然而然地、自发地做到这一点。甚至你的生命也会成为这方面的示范，这将激励和迷惑其他人。</p>
<p>The truth is you are not where you need to be in life, and you know this, and that is why you are uncomfortable. Do not try to get rid of the discomfort, for it is a sign within you that your life must move, that there is change that must be brought about, and that you must do it. Allow yourself to be with the discomfort. Feel it. See what it is telling you. See where it is taking you. Where are the points of discomfort? Where is the lie being lived in your life? What are the mistruths you are telling yourself about your relationship with this person, this place or this thing?</p>
<p>事实上，你的生命并没有达到你想要的位置，你知道这一点，这就是你感到不舒服的原因。不要试图摆脱不适感，因为这是你内心的一个信号，表明你的生命必须前进，必须做出改变，而且你必须这样做。让自己与这种不适同在。感受它。看看它在告诉你什么。看看它要带你去哪里。哪里是不舒服的地方？你生活中的谎言在哪里？关于你与这个人、这个地方或这件事的关系上，你对自己说了哪些谎言？</p>
<p>You will have to overcome tendencies within yourself, habits within yourself and the other voices that the world around you has put in your mind, telling you that you want things you really do not want, or that you must have things to be attractive or to be successful.</p>
<p>你必须克服自己内心的倾向、克服自己内心的习惯以及周围世界在你心灵中灌输的其他声音，这些声音告诉你，你想要你真正不想要的关系，或者你必须拥有一些东西才有吸引力，或者才会成功。</p>
<p>This is a very great process. The truth remains that you are not where you need to be. Do not ever tell yourself you are just where you need to be. That is foolishness. You will never convince Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>这是一个非常伟大的过程。事实是，你并没有达到你需要达到的位置。永远不要告诉你自己，你只是在你需要的地方。这是愚蠢的。你永远无法说服自己内心的内识。</p>
<p>You have a great mountain to climb, and you must keep moving up this mountain to fulfill your destiny and to gain a vision of the world, which will become obvious to you once you reach the higher altitudes of this mountain.</p>
<p>你有一座大山需要攀登，你必须不断地向上攀登，以完成你的天命，并获得对世界的视野，一旦你达到这座山的更高海拔，世界将对你变得显而易见。</p>
<p>Whatever you tell yourself, you cannot convince Knowledge within yourself. You need to get to where you need to be—to be in the best position for the future, to reclaim your strength, your skills and your greater gifts and to be of service to a world whose needs will only grow and become more profound in the future.</p>
<p>无论你对自己说什么，你都无法说服自己内心的内识。你需要到达你需要去的地方——以便为未来找到最佳位置，重新找回你的力量、你的技能和你更大的天赋，为这个世界服务，因为未来世界的需求只会越来越多，越来越大。</p>
