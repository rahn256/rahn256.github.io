<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on October 23, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年10月23日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life offers many distractions. Life will keep pulling you back to your past unless you are able to be in the moment with it. Once you have achieved a present state of mind sufficiently, then you will need to be prepared to deal with the influence of others upon you. If everyone were doing what you are doing, this would be far easier and more beneficial. However, the reality is that you will be one person among the very few who is undertaking a greater preparation to rise above the normal preoccupations, concerns and interests of people around you.</p>
<p>生命提供了许多分心的关系。生命会不断地把你拉回你的过去，除非你能与之共处一室。一旦你充分实现了当下的心境，那么你就需要准备好应对他人对你的影响。如果每个人都在做你正在做的事情，这就会容易得多，也有益得多。然而，现实情况是，你将是极少数人中的一个，正在进行更多的准备，以超越你周围人的正常心事、关切和兴趣。</p>
<p>People around you will affect the mental environment for you. Because of this, you must become very selective about who to be with and what to say. Do not see this as a constraint on your freedom, for this is protecting an emerging awareness that needs protection in a world where it is not valued or honored. Life will teach you this over and over again in difficult situations where you will find yourself recoiling from other people and from situations where you don’t belong or where you have committed an indiscretion. Remember, you are learning The Way of Wisdom as well as The Way of Knowledge. Wisdom has to do with how you carry Knowledge in life—how you express Knowledge, where you share it and how you hold it in regard to yourself and other people.</p>
<p>你周围的人将影响你的心理环境。正因为如此，你必须对和谁在一起以及说什么变得非常有选择性。不要把这看作是对你自由的限制，因为这是在保护一个新兴的意识，在一个不被重视或尊重的世界里，它需要保护。生命会在困难的情况下一次又一次地教导你，你会发现自己从他人和不属于你的情况中退缩，或者你犯了轻率的错误。记住，你正在学习智慧之路和内识之路。智慧与你如何在生命中携带内识有关——你如何表达内识，在哪里分享内识，以及你如何对自己和他人持有内识。</p>
<p>You will find as you proceed in The Way of Knowledge that you will value things that others do not value, see things that others do not see and know things that others do not know or will not know. What seems obvious to you will not be obvious to them. You will see both their gifts and their disabilities. They may see neither. You will have higher standards for yourself, but these standards will not be shared by other people. You will value a deeper experience of honesty, but you will not be able to communicate this freely with others. Again and again you will find out the limits that other people set before you and around you. And again and again you will feel other people’s influence. You will feel yourself being pulled into idle conversation. You will feel yourself being pulled back into a state of mind that you have worked hard to emerge out of. You will feel the weight of their concerns and preoccupations, but you will not want to be encumbered by them.</p>
<p>当你在内识之路上前进时，你会发现，你会重视别人不重视的内识，看见别人看不到的关系，知道别人不知道或不愿意知道的事情。对你来说很明显的内识，对他们来说并不明显。你将同时看到他们的礼物和他们的缺陷。他们可能两者都看不到。你会对自己有更高的标准，但这些标准不会被其他人认同。你将重视对诚实的更深层次的经验，但你将无法与他人自由沟通。你会一次又一次地发现其他人在你面前和你周围设置的限制。而且你会一次又一次地感受到其他人的影响。你会感到自己被拉进闲谈之中。你会感觉到自己被拉回到你努力走出的心灵状态中。你会感觉到他们的关切和关注的重量，但你不会想被他们所束缚。</p>
<p>This will set you apart, as it must. And at times you will feel lonely and isolated. However, you will find, even at the outset, that you will have companions. They will share their difficulties with you, and you will share your difficulties with them, for you are both experiencing difficulty being in the world.</p>
<p>这将使你与众不同，因为它必须如此。有时你会感到孤独和隔绝。然而，你会发现，甚至在一开始，你就会有同伴。他们将与你分享他们的困难，你也将与他们分享你的困难，因为你们都在经历在这个世界上的困难。</p>
<p>You need to establish a new foundation for yourself out in life, as well as within yourself. Nothing is taken away from you here. This is not something that is meant to rob you of any pleasure or pursuit that you may want. It is only to assist you in following a natural process of selection and discrimination which must be cultivated as a Greater Power and awareness emerge within you. If you think that we are limiting you, then you do not understand our intent. If you think that we are holding you back, then you do not understand your real needs.</p>
<p>你需要在生命中为自己建立一个新的基础，以及在自己的内心。这里没有任何关系从你身上拿走。这不是要剥夺你可能想要的任何快乐或追求。它只是为了帮助你遵循一个自然的选择和辨别过程，这必须随着更伟大的力量和意识在你体内的出现而得到培养。如果你认为我们在限制你，那么你就不明白我们的意图。如果你认为我们在阻碍你，那么你就不理解你的真正需求。</p>
<p>If you are responding to a greater meaning, vision and understanding, you will set yourself apart, and life will set you apart because you need to have this freedom. You cannot stay where you are and go somewhere new. And if you go somewhere new, others cannot go with you, except for a very few. As you find something that others have not discovered, you will know something that they do not know. How can you be with them in a casual way with this growing awareness within yourself? You will not want to share their compromises. You will not want to be a part of many of their activities, which only serve to avoid and deny the greater things that need to be recognized and discussed. Even at the level of personal problems, this will be the case because you will seek resolution, while others will not. You will want to face things and discuss them, while others will not. You will want to bring remedy and resolution, while others will not.</p>
<p>如果你对更大的意义、远见和理解作出回应，你将使自己与众不同，而生命将使你与众不同，因为你需要有这种自由。你不能停留在你所在的地方，去一个新的地方。如果你去一个新的地方，除了极少数人，其他人不能和你一起去。当你发现其他人没有发现的内识时，你将知道他们不知道的关系。在你自己内心的这种不断增长的意识下，你怎么能以一种随意的方式与他们在一起呢？你将不愿意分享他们的妥协。你将不想成为他们许多活动的一部分，这些活动只是为了避免和否认需要认识和讨论的更大的事情。即使在个人问题的层面上，也会出现这种情况，因为你会寻求解决，而其他人则不会。你会想要面对事情并讨论它们，而其他人则不会。你会想要带来补救和解决，而其他人则不会。</p>
<p>After a time, you will find yourself avoiding certain people and situations. This is correct. This is a natural reticence. It is because you are seeking to free yourself from people and situations, from conversations and endeavors that hold no merit or value for you. You can do this without condemnation of yourself or of others. You do this simply because you have somewhere else to go and something greater to know. Here you are not better than others. You are not wise while they are fools. Do not have this attitude or you will miss the whole point. This is not a contest. That emphasis is only meaningful to the personal mind, which seeks to use everything for self-assurance, self-glorification and self-protection because it is weak and vulnerable and has no foundation in life. Do not make that error, but see clearly.</p>
<p>一段时间后，你会发现自己在躲避某些人和情况。这是对的。这是一种自然的沉默。这是因为你正在寻求将自己从那些对你没有益处或价值的人和情况、对话和努力中解脱出来。你可以在不谴责自己或他人的情况下这样做。你这样做只是因为你有别的地方要去，有更伟大的内识要知道。在这里，你并不比别人强。你不是聪明人，而他们也不是傻瓜。不要有这种态度，否则你会错过整个要点。这不是一场竞赛。这种强调只对个人的心智有意义，因为它寻求利用一切来自我保证、自我荣耀和自我保护，因为它是软弱无力的，在生命中没有基础。不要犯这种错误，但要看的清晰。</p>
<p>Something has changed at the very core of you in a way that you cannot describe. You feel different. Your values are changing. Your priorities are changing. Your emphasis in life is changing. This steers you away from people who are not experiencing this and towards those who are. It brings you specifically towards certain individuals who share your journey. Some of them will only go a short way with you; others will travel with you for a lifetime.</p>
<p>在你的核心部位，有些东西已经发生了你无法描述的变化。你的感觉不同了。你的价值观在改变。你的优先次序在改变。你在生命中的重点正在改变。这使你远离那些没有经历过这种情况的人，而转向那些经历过的人。它把你特别带向某些与你有相同旅程的人。他们中的一些人只会和你一起走一段路；另一些人将和你一起走一辈子。</p>
<p>You need to be with these people because they will assist and aid you. They will challenge you to go forward. They will help you when you fall back. They, too, are experiencing a great movement in their lives. They, too, are trying to sort things out. They, too, are coming to terms with their own compromises and are realizing their own denial. They, too, must find a way to change the direction, course and activity of their lives. These people will help you even if they are only with you temporarily.</p>
<p>你需要和这些人在一起，因为他们会协助和帮助你。他们会挑战你，让你往前走。当你跌倒时，他们会帮助你。他们也正经历着他们生命中的重要运动。他们也在努力理清关系。他们也在接受自己的妥协，意识到自己的否定。他们也必须找到一种方法来改变他们生命的方向、路线和活动。这些人将帮助你，即使他们只是暂时和你在一起。</p>
<p>You will find yourself avoiding many people and situations. In fact, after a time you will look at the general activities of most people with disinterest. Perhaps you will feel lonely and estranged. But we say, “Congratulations!” You are beginning to find your freedom. You are starting to value something that is valuable. If this sets you apart, that is fine. You need this freedom. You need this liberation. You need to be free of the bondage that other people place upon themselves and inadvertently place upon you.</p>
<p>你会发现自己在躲避许多人和情况。事实上，一段时间后你会对大多数人的一般活动不感兴趣。也许你会感到孤独和疏远。但我们要说，”恭喜你！”你正开始找到你的自由。你正在开始重视一些有价值的事情。如果这使你与众不同，那很好。你需要这种自由。你需要这种解放。你需要摆脱他人对他们自己的束缚，以及不经意间对你的束缚。</p>
<p>Congratulations. Keep going. You will not travel alone, but you cannot take everyone with you. You will find that you cannot keep all of your friends and past acquaintances because they are part of your past, and the emphasis in those relationships is not what you are experiencing now. Allow them to depart and bless them. Do not condemn them. Do not deny them. Just let them drift away. Release them. They are going a different way than you are now. You may not know where you are going, but you know you are going somewhere because you feel the movement in your life and you see your life changing. You see that other people seem very static, and the movement of their lives seems imperceptible. However, for you things are changing rapidly now. Allow this to happen. It is coming from the very center of you. You will not understand it fully for a very long time, but you need to go forward. You cannot go back. You cannot take that loved one with you. You cannot take that one that you depend upon with you. Perhaps you cannot even take your husband or wife with you, or your children, or your parents, or your best friend. Here you must side with Knowledge. You cannot go both ways. You cannot take everything with you.</p>
<p>恭喜你。继续前进。你不会独自旅行，但你不能把所有人都带上。你会发现你不能保留你所有的朋友和过去的熟人，因为他们是你过去的一部分，而这些关系的重点不是你现在所经历的。允许他们离开并祝福他们。不要谴责他们。不要否认他们。只是让他们渐渐离开。释放他们。他们要走的路与你现在的不同。你可能不知道你要去哪里，但你知道你要去某个地方，因为你感觉到你生命的运动，你看到你的生命在改变。你看到其他人似乎非常静止，他们对生命的运动似乎无法察觉。然而，对你来说，现在生命正在迅速变化。允许这种情况发生。它来自你的中心。你在很长一段时间内不会完全理解它，但你需要向前走。你不能回头。你不能带着你所爱的人走。你不能把你依赖的那个人带走。也许你甚至不能带着你的丈夫或妻子，或你的孩子，或你的父母，或你最好的朋友。在这里，你必须与内识站在一起。你不能两头跑。你不能把一切都带走。</p>
<p>It may take a long time for you to realize and come to understand that you are being unburdened. For, indeed, there will be moments when you will feel a great loss. You will not be able to justify your actions or behavior, but you will know that you must continue. And you will know you must say good-bye to your dear friend or companion. If you try to stay together, there will be increasing discord and disassociation. It is better to recognize your diverging directions and to bless and release the other person and to not linger trying to explain or to justify your actions.</p>
<p>你可能需要很长时间才能意识到并理解你正在被卸下的负担。因为，确实会有一些时刻，你会感到巨大的损失。你将无法为你的行动或行为辩护，但你将知道你必须继续。而且你会知道你必须和你亲爱的朋友或同伴说再见。如果你们试图呆在一起，会有越来越多的不和谐和不合拍。最好是认识到你们的分歧方向，并祝福和释放对方，不要徘徊在试图解释或证明你的行为。</p>
<p>You will find as you proceed that life gives you many choices. Here you may not even be able to stay with others who are also responding to a greater calling. As you proceed, your way becomes much more specific. At the outset, you may feel like you are opening to your spiritual life, but as you proceed, your spiritual development will become far more specific in its application and direction. Those who traveled with you at the outset, who shared your journey, may have to go a different way than you. Allow this to happen. Bless them. Honor them. Do not criticize or reject them because they cannot stay with you and go where you are going. Perhaps they are going quickly; perhaps they are going slowly. They go with their disabilities as you go with yours, slowly unraveling and resolving them as they proceed.</p>
<p>当你继续前进时，你会发现生命给了你许多选择。在这里，你甚至可能无法与其他也在响应更大召唤的人呆在一起。随着你的前进，你的道路变得更加特定。一开始，你可能觉得你正在向你的精神生命开放，但随着你的前进，你的精神发展在应用和方向上将变得更加特定。那些一开始就和你一起旅行的人，分享你的旅程的人，可能要走和你不同的道路。允许这种情况发生。祝福他们。尊重他们。不要批评或拒绝他们，因为他们不能与你在一起，去你要去的地方。也许他们走得快；也许他们走得慢。他们带着他们的缺陷走，就像你带着你的缺陷走一样，在他们前进的过程中慢慢解开并解决它们。</p>
<p>Follow the way. Do not try to define it. Do not hold onto people. Your true companions, your allies, will never leave you, so you do not need to cling to them, shackle them or keep a rope around their neck. Let everyone else come and go. This is a natural process of definition and selection in life. Very few people have emerged beyond the general consensus of things, so the way is not that well traveled. However, others have traveled it before, others are traveling it now and others will travel it in the future. There is a way because Knowledge is in your life. There is a way because your allies are joining you. And there is a way because the Unseen Ones will guide and assist you as you need them and as you proceed in life.</p>
<p>跟着道路走。不要试图去定义它。不要拘泥于人。你真实的同伴，你的盟友，永远不会离开你，所以你不需要紧紧抓住他们，给他们戴上枷锁，或者在他们的脖子上拴上绳子。让其他人来了又走。这是生命中定义和选择的一个自然过程。很少有人能够超越人们对生命的普遍共识，所以这条路并不那么好走。然而，以前有人走过，现在有人在走，将来还有人要走。有一条道路，因为内识就在你的生命中。有一条道路，因为你的盟友正在加入你。有一条道路，因为不可见者将在你需要时和你在生命中进行时指导和帮助你。</p>
<p>Here there are certain things we can counsel you to avoid, yet you must learn how to use this guidance and this counsel as you proceed. You will not realize the full value of this counsel until you are more advanced than you are today, but that does not mean that this counsel is not meant for you at this time and will not serve you well, saving you from much misery and difficulty.</p>
<p>在这里，我们可以建议你避免某些事情，但你必须学习如何在你继续前进时使用这种指导和建议。在你比今天更先进之前，你不会意识到这个建议的全部价值，但这并不意味着这个建议在此时不适合你，不会很好地服务于你，使你免于许多痛苦和困难。</p>
<p>First of all, as we have said, avoid taking people with you. Tell them you are going somewhere and give them a sense of where you are going. If they cannot go, they cannot go. This does not mean that your relationship has failed; it does not mean that they are stupid or foolish, and it does not mean that you are better than they are. It simply means that you cannot go on together. You are taking a different path. Take it. Follow it. Avoid trying to bring them with you. Avoid staying behind trying to persuade them, convince them or justify your mysterious life. Bless them and release them. Recognize your diverging paths. It is fine. It is natural.</p>
<p>首先，正如我们所说的，避免带人去。告诉他们你要去某个地方，让他们知道你要去哪里。如果他们不能去，他们就不能去。这并不意味着你们的关系已经失败；这并不意味着他们是愚蠢或愚昧的，也不意味着你比他们更好。它只是意味着你们不能一起走下去。你正在走一条不同的道路。走它。跟随它。避免试图让他们和你一起走。避免留在后面试图说服他们，说服他们或证明你神秘的生活。祝福他们并释放他们。认识到你们的分歧路径。这很好。这是很自然的。</p>
<p>Next, avoid trying to determine where you are going. You know you are doing something important. You know you are doing something that has a spiritual foundation. You know you are doing something that is good for you even if at moments you are in grave doubt about it. You know you must go on. You know you cannot go back to where you were before. You know you want to be free. Yet beyond this, avoid trying to determine where you are going because you will not know. All you know is that you must proceed. As you advance and become more mature as a student of Knowledge, you will see the great value of this. Yet if you try to get ahead of yourself, it will cause all kinds of confusion and misinterpretations.</p>
<p>接下来，避免试图确定你要去哪里。你知道你在做一些重要的事情。你知道你在做有精神基础的事情。你知道你在做一件对你有好处的事，即使有时你对它有严重的怀疑。你知道你必须继续下去。你知道你不能回到你以前的地方。你知道你想获得自由。然而除此之外，避免试图确定你要去哪里，因为你不会知道。你所知道的是，你必须继续前进。随着你的进步，作为内识的学生变得更加成熟，你会看到这一点的巨大价值。然而，如果你试图在你自己之外，就会造成各种混乱和误解。</p>
<p>At the outset, the need to understand and to justify yourself is born of an old understanding which is based upon many false things. However, now you are basing your life on something true and sound, consistent and permanent, real and genuine. Trust yourself. Trust Knowledge within you. Do not keep pulling yourself aside and asking, “Am I doing the right thing? Is this the right thing?” over and over again. Do not badger yourself with this incessant questioning, for there is no answer except to proceed. Follow this and you will follow Knowledge. Hold back and you will be resorting to your old ideas once again. Do not let your fear take you away, for it will only return you to the past, to a previous belief in security which you are now working to be free of. Maximum security in this regard is a maximum security prison. You have been imprisoned, and you do not want to return.</p>
<p>一开始，对理解和证明自己的需要是源于一种旧的理解，这种理解是建立在许多错误的关系之上的。然而，现在你的生命是建立在真实和健全、一致和持久、真实和真正的关系之上。相信你自己。相信你内心的内识。不要一直把自己拉到一边，问：”我做的事情对吗？这是正确的事情吗？”一遍又一遍。不要用这种无休止的问话来纠缠自己，因为除了继续前进，没有答案。遵循这一点，你将遵循内识。踌躇不前，你将再次求助于你的旧观念。不要让你的恐惧把你带走，因为它只会让你回到过去，回到你现在正在努力摆脱的对安全的信仰。在这方面，最大的安全是一座最大的安全监狱。你已经被囚禁了，你不想再回来。</p>
<p>However, if you go a little ways and stop and say, “Well, I do not want to go into something I do not understand. I do not know where I am going. What should I do? What will happen to me?” and you let your imagination take over and create all kinds of fearful and horrible images for you, then you will be in a very uncomfortable position. You will prevent yourself from going forward, but you will know that you cannot go back. Then you will be stuck right where you are.</p>
<p>然而，如果你走了一段路，停下来说：”好吧，我不想进入我不理解的关系。我不知道我要去哪里。我应该做什么？我将会发生什么？”你让你的想象力接管，为你创造各种恐惧和可怕的形象，那么你将处于一个非常不舒服的位置。你会阻止自己往前走，但你会知道自己不能回头。然后你就会被困在你现在的地方。</p>
<p>You have not become free of the mind yet. You must break from its authority so that you can exercise your authority. The mind exercises authority because you do not. It is not because the mind is a tyrant or a terrible thing. The mind simply provides assurance when assurance is not provided for it. It is like an orphan child who must fend for itself until it finds a safe parent or guardian. Knowledge is your guardian. Knowledge is your Greater Self. However, until you can fully realize it is your Greater Self, it will seem like a parent or a guardian. It will seem like a guide, like a true friend. Follow Knowledge and you will return to yourself, and you will find others who are part of your mission and journey here.</p>
<p>你还没有从心灵中获得自由。你必须打破它的权威，这样你才能行使你的权威。心灵行使权威是因为你没有。这并不是因为心灵是一个暴君或一个可怕的存在。心灵只是在没有为它提供保证的时候提供保证。它就像一个必须自力更生的孤儿，直到找到安全的父母或监护人。内识是你的监护人。内识是你的大我。然而，在你能完全意识到它是你的大我之前，它将看起来像父母或监护人。它将看起来像一个向导，像一个真实的朋友。跟随内识，你会回到你自己身边，你会发现其他人也是你在这里的使命和旅程的一部分。</p>
<p>Next, avoid trying to tie what you are doing to something you already believe in. If you value a certain philosophy, religion or set of ideals and you want to make sure that what you are doing is consistent with them, you will be pulling yourself backwards. Just as you cannot take people with you, you cannot take ideas with you. It is amazing that people are often far more attached to their ideas than they are even to other people. This is because they are more identified with their ideas than with anything else. Some people can walk away from a relationship, but they are so bound to their ideas, their beliefs or their assumptions that they are not free to leave them. This is what it means to wear a crown of thorns. This is when the mind is a crown of thorns. You wear it, but it torments you. It seems to give you a kingly title, but in fact it is a harness of misery. It seems to elevate you and give you stature in the world, but in fact it cuts you and hurts you, binds you and mocks you.</p>
<p>接下来，避免试图将你正在做的事情与你已经相信的事情联系起来。如果你重视某种哲学、宗教或一套理想，而你想确保你所做的事与它们一致，你就会把自己往后拉。就像你不能把人带走一样，你也不能把想法带走。令人惊讶的是，人们对自己的想法的重视程度往往远远超过对其他人的重视程度。这是因为他们对自己的想法比对其他任何关系都更认同。有些人可以离开一段关系，但他们被自己的想法、信仰或假设所束缚，以至于无法自由地离开它们。这就是戴着荆棘冠冕的意思。这就是心灵是荆棘冠冕的时候。你戴着它，但它折磨着你。它似乎给你一个国王的头衔，但事实上它是一个痛苦的束缚。它似乎提高了你的地位，让你在这个世界上有了地位，但事实上，它削减了你，伤害了你，束缚了你，嘲弄了你。</p>
<p>In order for the mind to become a halo instead of a crown of thorns, you must affirm your authority. You realize your strength by exercising your authority. In learning The Way of Knowledge, you will have to exercise your authority again and again in order to keep your mind free and open. Therefore, avoid trying to associate your old ideas and cherished ideals with what you are doing now because you cannot take them with you. They are like old relationships and old places. Do not drag them along. Let the river of life carry you. Do not cling to the rocks. Do not try to take the rocks with you. Do not try to take the scenery of your mind with you, which is the whole array of your ideas and beliefs, fears and goals.</p>
<p>为了使心灵成为光环而不是荆棘的冠冕，你必须肯定你的权威。你通过行使你的权威来实现你的力量。在学习内识之路的过程中，你将不得不一次又一次地行使你的权威，以保持你的心灵自由和开放。因此，避免试图将你的旧观念和珍惜的理想与你现在所做的事情联系起来，因为你无法将它们带走。它们就像旧的关系和旧的地方。不要拖着它们走。让生命的河流带着你。不要紧紧抓住岩石。不要试图把岩石带走。不要试图把你心中的风景带走，那是你的想法和信仰、恐惧和目标的全部阵列。</p>
<p>Next, avoid falling in love. When we say falling in love, we are talking about creating a fantasy with another. Romantic love, fantasy, is the epitome of the personal mind’s self-indulgence. In an attempt to validate itself and to justify its existence, it seeks union with another for this purpose. It cannot join with another; it can only use another to validate itself. This is the basis for romantic love. What you must find instead is recognition and the ability to participate with another. A beautiful face, a lovely set of eyes, a wonderful image, a charming or exotic personality, anything that attracts you and mesmerizes you, anything that holds your attention against your will, anything that keeps your mind fixated on its own ideas and prevents it from gaining access to Knowledge—these things represent a romantic approach to relationships, and these you must avoid.</p>
<p>接下来，避免陷入爱情。当我们说坠入爱河时，我们说的是与另一个人创造一个幻想。浪漫的爱情，幻想，是个人心灵自我放纵的缩影。为了验证自己，证明自己的存在，它为此寻求与他人结合。它不能与他人结合；它只能利用他人来验证自己。这就是浪漫爱情的基础。你必须找到的反而是认可和参与另一个人的能力。一张美丽的脸，一双可爱的眼睛，一个美妙的形象，一个迷人的或异国情调的个性，任何吸引你和迷住你的幻想，任何违背你意愿的幻想，任何让你的心灵固定在自己的想法上并阻止它获得内识的幻想——这些幻想代表一种浪漫的关系方式，这些你必须避免。</p>
<p>Has your past not taught you this already? Do you need to be disappointed again and again in order to find out that this involvement leads nowhere? When you finally realize the real condition of the relationship, then the dream of romance is dispelled and you are left with your lack of real relationship with the other person.</p>
<p>你的过去难道还没有教会你这些吗？你是否需要一次又一次地失望，以便发现这种参与毫无结果？当你最终意识到这段关系的真实状况时，那么浪漫的梦想就会被驱散，你就会发现自己与对方缺乏真正的关系。</p>
<p>People can be mesmerized by each other for years and never have any sense of who the other person is. And yet when they finally become sober, as life sobers them through its hardships and its challenges, they find that they are not really compatible with each other and that their association is shallow and temporary. Then there is great disappointment, anger and resentment.</p>
<p>人们可以被对方迷住很多年，却从未对对方的身份有任何了解。然而，当他们最终变得清醒时，当生活通过困难和挑战使他们清醒时，他们发现他们与对方并不真正相容，他们的联系是浅薄和暂时的。然后就会出现巨大的失望、愤怒和怨恨。</p>
<p>Avoid falling in love. Seek real relationship. In real relationship you will feel tremendous affection, resonance and the desire to share your life. However, this is quite different from the falling-in-love experience that people value and hold so dear. Watch your movies and read your books all about the grandeur and the ecstasy, the danger and the uncertainty of romance. Then ask yourself if there is any real relationship there or if this is just a grand interlude, a way to escape mundane life, a way to have a wonderful dream together, a dream that seems to liberate you from all of your concerns and responsibilities. Avoid falling in love. It will take years of your life away from you. It will rob you and leave you empty and poor. You will gamble your life away falling in love, gambling on something frivolous that is without hope or promise.</p>
<p>避免坠入爱河。寻求真正的关系。在真正的关系中，你会感到极大的感情、共鸣和分享生命的愿望。然而，这与人们所重视和珍视的坠入爱河的经历完全不同。看你的电影，读你的书，都是关于浪漫的宏伟和狂喜，危险和不确定性。然后问问你自己，那里是否有真正的关系，或者这只是一个盛大的插曲，一种逃避世俗生活的方式，一种一起做一个美妙的梦的方式，一个似乎把你从你所有的担忧和责任中解放出来的梦。避免坠入爱河。它将夺走你多年的生命。它将掠夺你，让你空虚和贫穷。你会把你的生命赌在恋爱上，赌在没有希望或承诺的轻浮关系之上。</p>
<p>“You will want to avoid these things because they hold you back, because they gamble your existence and because they waste your life.”</p>
<p>“你会想要避免这些关系，因为它们会阻碍你，因为它们会赌上你的存在，因为它们会浪费你的生命。”</p>
<p>Next, avoid trying to make Knowledge affirm what you want. Here you find someone you want, something you want or someplace you want to go and you go to Knowledge and you say, “Can I go? Is it okay?” If you want only approval, you will give it to yourself and you will say, “Yes, I feel this is correct. My Knowledge tells me this is correct.” Yet if you go to the real allies in your life, they will look at you and shake their heads, for they will know. However, if you associate with people who do not have this capacity, oh, yes, they will assure you that it is a wonderful thing to do.</p>
<p>接下来，避免试图让内识肯定你想要的关系。在这里，你找到你想要的人，你想要的东西或你想去的地方，你去找内识，你说：”我能去吗？可以吗？”如果你只想要批准，你会给自己批准，你会说：”是的，我觉得这是对的。我的内识告诉我这是正确的。”然而，如果你去找你生命中真正的盟友，他们会看着你并摇摇头，因为他们会知道。然而，如果你与没有这种能力的人交往，哦，是的，他们会向你保证，这是一件美妙的事情。</p>
<p>Avoid trying to make Knowledge give you what you want or support what you want. Instead, ask Knowledge, “Show me what I need to know and to do. Do not let me waste my life. Do not let me gamble with my existence.” Give Knowledge this privilege, and it will support you and serve you in ever greater ways.</p>
<p>避免试图让内识给你你想要的关系或支持你想要的关系。相反，问内识，”告诉我我需要知道什么，做什么。不要让我浪费我的生命。不要让我拿自己的存在做赌注。”给予内识这一特权，它将支持你并以更大的方式为你服务。</p>
<p>Next, avoid thinking that your life is going to be grand. People often think that because they are on a spiritual journey of some kind, they are going to be healers, magnificent beings, gurus, teachers, saints, pilgrims, wise men, wise women, avatars, oracles and so forth. This is all romance. Romance here is as damaging and pointless as romance in any other relationship, except that it is more difficult to unravel because it looks self-edifying.</p>
<p>接下来，避免认为你的生命会很宏伟。人们常常认为，因为他们正在进行某种精神旅程，所以他们将成为治疗师、宏伟的生命、大师、教师、圣人、朝圣者、智者、聪明的女人、化身、神谕等等。这都是浪漫的事。这里的浪漫和其他关系中的浪漫一样具有破坏性和无意义，只是它更难解开，因为它看起来是自我美化的。</p>
<p>Your role in life will be simple and hidden in almost all cases. If you are to become known, it is in a way a misfortune because the world will prey upon you, and others will use you and abuse you. They will infiltrate your life and attempt to take your gifts away from you. They will manipulate you, they will malign you, they will curse you, and they will praise you. This is reality. That is why only in rare cases will a man or woman of Knowledge become a public figure. And they will have to face the tribulation that accompanies this privilege.</p>
<p>你在生命中的角色几乎在所有情况下都将是简单而隐蔽的。如果你被人知道，在某种程度上是一种不幸，因为世界会掠夺你，别人会利用你，虐待你。他们会渗入你的生命，并试图从你那里夺走你的礼物。他们会操纵你，他们会恶意中伤你，他们会诅咒你，也会赞美你。这就是现实。这就是为什么只有在极少数情况下，有内识的男人或女人才会成为公众人物。他们将不得不面对伴随着这种特权的磨难。</p>
<p>The Wise remain hidden for a very good reason. And yet, when you consider this idea, you will see how much it goes against your ambition and your personal motives. After all, you may not want to give your life and devote yourself to something that will not glorify you. Even the religions of the world offer many different images of self-glorification—to become a Buddha, to become an avatar, to become Christ like, to become a shining example that everyone flocks to for inspiration, healing and beneficence. However, the reality is very different from this and needs to be different because there is no Wisdom here. Do not, then, stimulate your personal mind with these fantasies. This is not the way.</p>
<p>智者保持隐匿是有很好的理由的。然而，当你考虑这个想法时，你会发现它与你的野心和个人动机有多大的冲突。毕竟，你可能不想献出自己的生命，献身于不会荣耀你的事情。甚至世界上的宗教也提供了许多不同的自我荣耀的形象——成为佛陀，成为化身，成为像基督一样的人，成为大家趋之若鹜的光辉榜样，以获得灵感、治疗和利益。然而，现实与此截然不同，而且需要不同，因为这里没有智慧。因此，不要用这些幻想来刺激你的个人心智。这不是办法。</p>
<p>Knowledge must free you from these ambitions to the extent that they function in your mind. Everyone has them to some extent. Everyone wants to be validated, recognized, supported and appreciated, but in reality you only need to be recognized and supported by your true allies and be given the opportunity to serve others who are truly ready for your gifts and contribution. That is as great a blessing and acknowledgment as you could imagine. There will be no deception here. There will be no betrayal. There will be no usurpation or manipulation. What you give will be received and will be passed on to others. And your gift will resonate through many people and through many relationships. As the source of your gift is beyond you, your giving should not give you personal recognition. Can you claim that your purpose is your own creation? Can you claim that your gift, your skill or your role are yours alone? How can you say this when life has prepared you, guided you and made it possible for you to have a purpose, to realize your purpose, to have allies to share your purpose and to have recipients to whom you give your purpose?</p>
<p>内识必须把你从这些野心中解放出来，以至于它们在你的心灵中发挥作用。每个人在某种程度上都有这些野心。每个人都希望得到验证、认可、支持和赞赏，但实际上你只需要被你真实的盟友认可和支持，并有机会为那些真正准备好收到你的礼物和贡献的人服务。这是你所能想象的最大的祝福和承认。这里不会有欺骗。不会有背叛。不会有篡夺或操纵。你所给予的将被接纳，并将传递给其他人。而你的礼物将通过许多人和许多关系产生共鸣。由于你的礼物的来源超越了你，你的给予不应该让自己得到个人认可。你能宣称你的目的是你自己创造的吗？你能宣称你的礼物、你的技能或你的角色是你一个人的吗？当生命已经为你准备好，引导你，使你有一个目的，实现你的目的，有盟友分享你的目的，有你给你的目的的接纳者，你怎么能这样说？</p>
<p>Avoid self-glorification. Avoid recognition. Knowledge does not want these for you. Wisdom will restrain you. Let yourself be restrained. Knowledge will protect you, preserve you and enable you to cultivate and develop your strength and abilities without the interference and invasion of people who cannot or will not share these with you. Let life set you apart so that you may return to life with a greater ability and a greater understanding. Let Knowledge take you away from your own goals and ambitions and from your own need for self-validation and bring you back with a greater Wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>避免自我颂扬。避免认可。内识并不希望你有这些。智慧会约束你。让你自己受到约束。内识将保护你，保存你，使你能够培养和发展你的力量和能力，而不受那些不能或不愿与你分享这些的人的干扰和侵袭。让生活把你分开，以便你可以带着更大的能力和更多的理解回到生命中去。让内识把你从你自己的目标和野心以及你自己对自我验证的需要中带出来，并以更伟大的智慧和理解把你带回来。</p>
<p>Avoid talking too much. If you talk too much, you expend your energy and you disseminate your ideas mindlessly. Let Wisdom germinate within you. Do not go tell everyone about what is happening within you. Let the pressure build. Let your capacity grow. Let yourself digest the truth rather than try to pass it on to everyone. Let yourself experience the meaning and depth of the insights that come to you rather than rushing off to tell your friend, “Oh, I had this insight. It was so wonderful!”</p>
<p>避免说得太多。如果你说得太多，你会消耗你的能量，你会无意识地传播你的想法。让智慧在你内心发芽。不要去告诉每个人你内心所发生的事情。让压力建立起来。让你的能力增长。让自己消化真理，而不是试图把它传给每个人。让你自己经历到你的洞察力的意义和深度，而不是急于告诉你的朋友：”哦，我有这个洞察力。它是如此美妙！”</p>
<p>Exercise restraint, for you will need a great deal of restraint. We cannot tell you how much restraint will save you from difficulty and tribulation. Do not let your need for self-validation overtake you here. Hold things within yourself. Let them grow. Those things that are not valuable will disappear. And those things that are valuable will slowly grow. Wisdom is slowly grown. It must grow within you, and you must be very careful with whom you share it. Your experience will demonstrate exactly what we are saying, for you will say things to certain people who cannot or will not receive them. You will share things you are excited about with people who cannot experience them. You will offer new things to people who cannot relate to them. This will throw you back upon yourself. Do not criticize others. They are not the problem. Your lack of discretion is the problem. You could not discern the appropriate place to share yourself, and you paid a price for it. This teaches you to come back to yourself and to hold within yourself the gift which is growing there.</p>
<p>锻炼克制，因为你将需要大量的克制。我们无法告诉你有多少克制会使你免于困难和磨难。不要让你对自我验证的需求在此占据上风。将真理保留在心中。让它们慢慢成长。那些没有价值的想法会消失。而那些有价值的真理会慢慢成长。智慧是慢慢成长的。它必须在你内心成长，你必须非常小心地与谁分享它。你的经验将完全证明我们所说的，因为你会对某些人说一些不能或不愿接受的事情。你将与无法经历的人分享你所兴奋的事情。你将向那些不能理解的人提供新的经验。这将使你回到自己身上。不要批评他人。他们不是问题所在。你缺乏谨慎才是问题所在。你无法辨别分享自己的适当位置，你为此付出了代价。这教你回到自己身边，并在自己体内持有正在成长的礼物。</p>
<p>Knowledge is very discrete with you. You should be very discrete with others. Knowledge is very discerning with you. You can learn to be discerning with others. Great things are the result of a long germination process within the individual. People are eager to share because they want self-validation. They want somebody else to tell them that they are wonderful and that they are doing the right thing. Avoid this. Avoid idle conversation. Avoid talking about spiritual ideas and great things with people who cannot receive them and with people you are not meant to communicate with.</p>
<p>内识对你来说是非常独立的。你应该对他人非常谨慎。内识对你来说是非常有辨别力的。你可以学习对他人的辨别力。伟大的事情是个人内部长期发芽过程的结果。人们热衷于分享，因为他们想要自我验证。他们想让别人告诉自己，他们很了不起，他们做的是正确的事情。避免这种情况。避免闲聊。避免与不能接受的人和你本不应该沟通的人谈论精神的想法和伟大的事情。</p>
<p>Next, avoid gossip. Avoid discussing other people’s lives. Gossip is very tempting because it makes you feel self-satisfied, and you are able to exercise your judgment in a way that seems honest and valid. But this is wasteful. It maligns other people, and you lose energy and vitality because of it. You may feel proud doing this, but happiness and real self-confirmation will be lost as a result.</p>
<p>其次，避免说闲话。避免讨论其他人的生活。流言蜚语是非常诱人的，因为它使你感到自我满足，你能够以一种似乎诚实和有效的方式行使你的判断。但这是浪费的。它恶意诋毁他人，而你也因此失去能量和活力。你这样做可能会感到自豪，但幸福和真正的自我肯定会因此而丧失。</p>
<p>Next, avoid trying to make something happen with what you know already. Your mind will keep wanting to create things, have things and justify what it is doing in order to gain security, recognition and validation. However, it may not be the time yet. When it is time, it will be time, and that will be a great challenge for you. However, until it is time, it is not the time. No matter how much you may want to put into form what you are experiencing, do not rush out and create a new organization or start a new business or make a new product. People who do that are reckless, and they will gamble their existence. And it will take a long time for them to come back to where they started, for it is often much more difficult to end something than it is to begin something. Any relationship can be started, but it can be hard to finish it—whether it is a relationship with a person, with an organization or with something you have created in the world.</p>
<p>接下来，要避免试图用你已经知道的内识来制造一些事件。你的心灵会一直想创造东西，拥有东西，并证明自己正在做的事情，以获得安全感、认可和确认。然而，现在可能还不是时候。当时间到了，就是时间到了，这对你来说将是一个极大的挑战。然而，在时机成熟之前，现在还不是时候。无论你多么想把你正在经历的生命变成形式，都不要急于创建一个新的组织或开始一个新的业务或制造一个新的产品。这样做的人是鲁莽的，他们会赌上自己的存在。而且他们要花很长时间才能回到他们开始的地方，因为结束一件事往往比开始一件事要困难得多。任何关系都可以开始，但结束它却很难——无论是与人的关系、与组织的关系，还是与自己在世界上创造的事物的关系。</p>
<p>Do not begin anything that does not have a greater promise. How will you know? Because Knowledge is with you. If you cannot gain access to Knowledge in this situation because you have too much desire or ambition or are too confused, then go to your ally for verication. “Is this the right thing to do?” you will ask. “I am thinking of this. I want this. This looks good to me. Should I do this?” Do not go to your friends and do not go to your casual relationships, for they may all get interested in your idea because they cannot yet respond with Knowledge. Do not take a chance on this. Go to your allies. In many situations, you will not be able to gain access to Knowledge because you are governed by your preferences or you are too afraid or too concerned for yourself. That is okay. Go to your allies. Every important decision you make should be vericated. That is a protection for you; it is a safeguard. You need this; accept it.</p>
<p>不要开始任何没有更大承诺的关系。你怎么会知道？因为内识与你同在。如果你因为过多的欲望或野心而无法在这种情况下与内识同在，或者因为太过困惑，那么请向你的盟友寻求验证。”这是正确的选择吗？”你会问。”我正在考虑这个问题。我想要这个。这对我来说看起来不错。我应该这样做吗？”不要去找你的朋友，也不要去找你随意的关系，因为他们可能会对你的想法产生兴趣，但他们还无法用内识来回应。不要冒这个险。去找你的盟友。在许多情况下，你将无法与内识同在，因为你被自己的偏好所支配，或者你太害怕或太关心自己。这也没关系。去找你的盟友吧。你做出的每一个重要决定都应该得到验证。这是对你的保护；它是一个保障。你需要这个；接受它。</p>
<p>Avoid going into life saying, “I am going to have what I want, no matter what.” That is the stupidest decision you could ever make. It is blind; it is arrogant; it is ignorant. It denies your relationships and it casts you out alone. Life is full of people doing that and, as a result, life is full of calamities. Avoid that. Let Knowledge grow slowly within you. Let change come naturally. Do not slow it down and do not speed it up. Do not say to yourself, “Well, I am doing something spiritual now. I have to become a spiritual person, a spiritual merchant or a spiritual teacher, someone who sells products and services. I want to make my living out of this.” Avoid that.</p>
<p>避免在生活中说，”无论如何，我都要拥有我想要的关系”。这是你能做出的最愚蠢的决定。它是盲目的；它是傲慢的；它是无知的。它否定了你的关系，它把你抛在了外面。生活中充满了这样做的人，结果是，生活中充满了灾难。避免这种情况。让内识在你内心慢慢成长。让改变自然到来。不要放慢它，也不要加快它。不要对自己说：”好吧，我现在正在做一些精神上的事情。我必须成为一个精神的人，一个精神的商人或一位精神的老师，一个销售产品和服务的人。我想以此为生”。避免这样。</p>
<p>Knowledge will remain silent, deaf to such proclamations. You may feel these compulsions only occasionally or you may feel them continuously, but stay with what you are doing. Don’t make a change unless change is vital. And when change is vital, seek verication. Do not go it alone. No one in the world is beyond error. No one in the world is beyond temptation. No one in the world is faultless. Do not think that because you have a great and rising emotion for something that it is the right thing to do. Every failure and calamity started out with an excited interest or belief that something would be a beneficial activity or involvement. Avoid this. Keep your mind sober and open. Do not get into romance about your spirituality. You don’t even know what it is yet. However, it is in you, and it is guiding and balancing your life. It is slowly freeing you from all the bonds that have held you to the past and that you now need to outgrow and to leave behind.</p>
<p>内识将保持沉默，对这种宣告充耳不闻。你可能只是偶尔感觉到这些强迫症，也可能连续感觉到，但要坚持你正在做的事情。不要做出改变，除非改变是至关重要的。当改变是至关重要的时候，要寻求验证。不要单独行动。世界上没有人可以避免错误。世界上没有人是不受诱惑的。世界上没有人是没有错误的。不要以为你对某件事情有一种巨大的、上升的情感，就认为那是正确的事情。每一次失败和灾难都是从兴奋的兴趣或信仰开始的，认为某件事会是一个有益的活动或参与。避免这种情况。保持你的心灵清醒和开放。不要陷入关于你的精神信仰的浪漫之中。你甚至还不知道它是什么。然而，它就在你心里，它在指导和平衡你的生命。它正在慢慢地把你从所有束缚你的过去中解放出来，你现在需要超越和抛弃这些束缚。</p>
<p>Next, avoid the need to understand everything. Real understanding comes later. Prior to this, people create an understanding because they want to feel self-assured. They don’t want to look stupid to themselves or to other people. They want to have everything fully explained and explainable. They want to have everything justified and justifiable. They want to make everything look good and upright. They want to win approval. However, the understanding that they create here is so partial, so personally motivated and so false and unreliable that it can only break down in the face of real life. Here you do not want to create anything you will have to undo, to learn anything you will have to unlearn or to associate with anyone that you will have to disassociate from later.</p>
<p>接下来，避免需要理解一切。真正的理解是在以后。在这之前，人们创造一种理解，因为他们想感到自我肯定。他们不想在自己或其他人面前显得愚蠢。他们想让一切都得到充分的解释和说明。他们想让一切都有理由，有道理。他们想让一切看起来很好，很正直。他们想赢得认可。然而，他们在这里创造的理解是如此的片面，如此的个人动机，如此的虚假和不可靠，以至于在面对现实生活时只能崩溃。在这里，你不想创造任何你将不得不撤销的关系，不想学习任何你将不得不取消的理解，不想与任何你以后不得不脱离关系的人交往。</p>
<p>Let your mind be free. Let the puzzle of your life be in little pieces. Let it come together in little groups of pieces. Do not fill it all in with your own ideas and ambitions. Others will demonstrate to you how they have done this—how their lives are fully understood and how they have a higher purpose which is fully understandable to them, when in reality, they only know a few little things, and everything else is filled in with their goals, their ideals and their ambitions. And what they have is something that is completely unreliable and not in keeping with the movement of life.</p>
<p>让你的心灵自由。让你生命的拼图分成小块。让它以小块的形式组合起来。不要用你自己的想法和野心把它全部填满。其他人会向你展示他们是如何做到这一点的——他们的生活是完全被理解的，他们有一个完全可以理解的更高的目标，而实际上，他们只知道一些小事，其他一切都被他们的目标、理想和野心所填满。而他们所拥有的是完全不可靠的目的，不符合生命的运动。</p>
<p>Become simple. Let your life be unexplainable. Let your life be inexplicable, for it will be inexplicable to those who cannot share it with you. You are being governed and guided by a Greater Power within you now, a Greater Power that you are coming to know through experience, a Greater Power that you are choosing by making wise decisions. Let this be. Do not claim things that are not yours to claim. Let there be big gaps in your understanding. Then you will be honest with yourself and honest with others, and you will be a refreshing presence in the world. Do not join with others in their odes to themselves, in singing their songs of self-assurance and self-validation. Remain silent and move on.</p>
<p>变得简单。让你的生命变得无法解释，因为对于那些无法与你分享生命的人来说，它将是无法解释的。你现在被内在的更大力量所引导和指引，通过经验你正在逐渐知道这股更大力量，通过做出明智的决定你正在选择这股更伟大的力量。让这一切发生。不要声称那些不属于你的关系。让你的理解中有大片的空白。这样你就会对自己和他人诚实，并成为世界上令人耳目一新的人。不要与他人一起为自己唱赞歌，唱他们的自我保证和自我验证的颂歌。保持沉默，继续前行。</p>
<p>You can sing about the mountain of life or you can climb the mountain of life. If you climb the mountain of life, you don’t know what’s going to happen next. You only know that you have traveled it far enough to have learned something about traveling. You have learned to keep your eyes and your ears open and to not make gigantic assumptions about yourself or other people. You have learned to let your life develop, to keep going, and to build those things you know to build and to avoid those things you cannot build or should not build.</p>
<p>你可以歌唱生命之山，或者你可以攀登生命之山。如果你爬上生命之山，你不知道接下来会发生什么。你只知道你已经走了很远，已经学会了一些关于旅行的内识。你已经学会了保持你的眼睛和耳朵，不对自己或其他人做出巨大的假设。你已经学会了让你的生命发展，继续前进，并建立那些你知道要建立的关系，避免那些你不能建立或不应该建立的关系。</p>
<p>Power is concentration. If your power, your concentration, is spread out over many things, you will not have enough power for anything. Become focused on a few people, a few things and a few ideas. Don’t try to collect all the spiritual information. Avoid this. Don’t try to gather anything that is unnecessary. Let Knowledge move you to choose the things that you need rather than filling yourself with ideas, with books, with people, with experiences, with places to go and with things to do. In other words, don’t clutter yourself with things that just have to be given up.</p>
<p>力量就是专注。如果你的力量、你的注意力分散在许多关系上，你将没有足够的力量做任何事情。要专注于少数人、少数事和少数想法。不要试图收集所有的精神信息。避免这样。不要试图收集任何不必要的关系。让内识推动你选择你需要的关系，而不是用想法、书籍、人、经历、要去的地方和要做的事情来填满自己。换句话说，不要用那些不得不放弃的事物把自己弄得一团糟。</p>
<p>Next, avoid someone else’s spiritual journey. Do not dabble in different religions because you will only be a dabbler. You can only know a religion if you immerse yourself within it. And if you immerse yourself in it, how can you be studying everything else? There are many people who take a very eclectic approach, who try to gather a little of this and a little of that. They have postcards from all over the spiritual universe, but they have never been anywhere. They think they understand what Christianity or Buddhism or Islam or any other religion means, but they have never immersed themselves in any of them. They have never lived them fully. They have lots of big ideas and no Wisdom. Avoid this. Avoid trying to tie in what you are doing with what someone else has done in the past or in the present. Do not make your way spiritual by saying that it is in keeping with Christianity or Buddhism or any other religion, for you don’t really know. You have not yet gone far enough.</p>
<p>其次，避免走别人的精神之旅。不要涉足不同的宗教，因为你只会是一个涉足者。你只能通过完全沉浸其中来知道一种宗教。而如果你沉浸在其中，又怎么能研究其他的精神呢？有许多人采取一种非常折衷的方法，试图从这里那里收集一点精神。他们有来自整个精神世界的明信片，但实际上他们从未去过任何地方。他们以为自己理解基督教、佛教、伊斯兰教或任何其他宗教的意义，但他们从未真正沉浸在其中。他们从未完全生活在其中。他们有许多宏大的想法，却没有智慧。避免这种情况。避免试图将你正在做的事情与过去或现在别人所做的事情联系起来。不要通过说你所做的事情符合基督教、佛教或任何其他宗教来使你的道路显得精神，因为你并不真正知道。你还没有走得足够远。</p>
<p>Avoid collecting spiritual ideas. They are more things to clutter up your mind. Yes, they look fascinating, interesting and inspiring, but are they necessary? The word “necessary” is important because your life is necessary, and you do not want to fill it up with things that are not necessary. Keep what is either practically necessary or greatly inspirational to you. Leave everything else aside. Keep your mind open and fresh. Let your library of books be small and significant. Let your conversation be simple. Use very few words. Listen more than speak. Hold your tongue when others are being foolish. Resist the temptation to correct others, to improve their situation or to dress them up to make them look better to you so that you will not have to judge them.</p>
<p>避免收集精神上的想法。它们更多的是让你的心灵变得混乱的想法。是的，它们看起来很吸引人，很有趣，很鼓舞人心，但它们有必要吗？必要这个词很重要，因为你的生命是必要的，你不想用不需要的想法填满它。保持那些对你来说是实际必要的或有很大启发的想法。把其他一切放在一边。保持你的心灵开放和新鲜。让你的书库小而重要。让你的谈话变得简单。用很少的字。听比说更重要。当他人愚蠢时保持沉默。抵制纠正他人、改善他们的状况或打扮他们以让他们在你眼中看起来更好，从而避免对他们的判断的诱惑。</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the journey that is opening before you. Do not try to become a part of another person’s journey. Your way will then be simple and less encumbered. And if your way leads into the wilderness of life where no roads have been made, then follow it. If you seem to move away from all that is familiar and all that seems justifiable, stay with that. Trust what is in you. It is returning you to something great. It is restoring self-love and self-reliance to you. It is bringing you back into relationship with Knowledge and with the source of all Knowledge.</p>
<p>沉浸在你面前展开的旅程中。不要试图成为他人旅程的一部分。这样，你的道路将变得简单且不再受到束缚。如果你的道路引导你进入生命的荒野，那里的道路尚未铺设，那就跟随它。如果你似乎远离了所有熟悉和看似合理的关系，依然坚持下去。相信你内在的力量。它正在将你带回伟大的关系之中。它正在恢复你的自爱和自力更生。它正在把你带回到与内识和所有内识来源的关系中。</p>
<p>Avoid thinking you will be learning forever. This is not true. All avenues of learning have end points. There will come a time when you will not need to learn anything else in this world. That time is far ahead of where you are now. People think that they will be learning forever because they do not take their learning seriously. They think learning is like eating food. Well, you just keep eating more and you keep digesting and you keep eating more and more. Learning is not like eating food. It is not something you do to simply sustain yourself or to stimulate yourself. Learning is something that meets a great need in time. And this takes you somewhere. An advanced student of Knowledge is not learning what a beginning student is learning. Actually, an advanced student of Knowledge is learning new things while a beginning student is unlearning things primarily.</p>
<p>避免认为你会永远学习。这是不真实的。所有学习的途径都有终点。将来有一天，你不再需要在这个世界上学习任何东西。那一天还在很遥远的未来。人们认为他们会永远学习，因为他们没有认真对待他们的学习。他们认为学习就像吃饭一样，只要不断吃，不断消化，再不断吃更多的食物。学习并不像吃饭。学习不是为了简单地维持自己或刺激自己。学习是为了满足时间中的一种巨大需求。学习会带你到某个地方。一位高级的内识学生并不是在学习初学者所学的内识。事实上，一位高级的内识学生在学习新的内识，而一名初学者主要是在遗忘旧的过去。</p>
<p>Avoid judging your past. Until you can see your past clearly, until it is obvious and clear to you, just keep moving forward. Like climbing the mountain, you will reach certain points where you can look out and see where you have been. However, at other points you cannot see this because you do not have the right perspective. Stay with what is necessary. Stay with what is in front of you. Give your attention to a few things and to a few ideas.</p>
<p>避免评判你的过去。直到你能清晰地看见你的过去，直到它对你来说是明显和清晰的，只是不断地向前走。就像爬山一样，你会到达某些点，在那里你可以向外看，看到你一直在哪里。然而，在其他点，你无法看到这一点，因为你没有正确的视角。留在有必要的地方。留在你面前的内识上。把你的注意力放在一些事情和一些想法上。</p>
<p>Next, avoid renouncing your worldly responsibilities. You need to build a foundation in the world in order to have a greater life. This means that you must maintain your health, your financial stability, and other things like this. Very rarely will you be asked to depart from something that seems to provide financial stability. Many people think spirituality is a wonderful place to escape to, where you leave the world and you go live another kind of existence. That is hiding out. There are times for retreat when you must seek reprieve and repose, but that is not your life. Maintain a sound foundation. Keep an accurate accounting of your life. Maintain your physical health. Then you will have a foundation upon which to build something greater. If you cannot pay your bills, you will not become a student of Knowledge because your life will be about paying your bills.</p>
<p>接下来，避免放弃你的世俗责任。你需要在这个世界上建立一个基础，以便有一个更伟大的生命。这意味着你必须保持你的健康，你的财务稳定，以及其他类似的事情。很少会有人要求你背离那些似乎能提供经济稳定的工作。许多人认为精神性是一个美妙的避难所，在那里你可以离开世界，过另一种生活方式。那是在躲避。有时候你确实需要退隐来寻求休息和恢复，但那并不是你的生命。保持一个坚实的基础，对你的生命进行准确的记录，保持身体健康。然后你将有一个基础，在此基础上建立更伟大的生命。如果你不能支付你的账单，你就无法成为内识的学生，因为你的生活将被账单所占据。</p>
<p>You cannot renounce the world, and do not think you have to. That is not your education. As a student of Knowledge, your position in the world will change, and you will become liberated from many of its constraints. However, you are meant to be here and to be effective here. That is why Wisdom is essential. If you were not in the world, you would not need Wisdom to be in the world. But you are in the world, and you do need Wisdom to be in here.</p>
<p>你不能放弃这个世界，也不要认为你必须这样做。这不是你的教育方式。作为内识的学生，你在世界中的位置将发生改变，你将从世界的许多限制中解放出来。然而，你注定要在这里，而且要在这里有效。这就是为什么智慧是必不可少的。如果你不在这个世界上，你就不需要智慧来生活。但既然你现在存在于这个世界上，你确实需要智慧来应对生活。</p>
<p>Avoid denying your worldly responsibilities. Just do not let them overtake you. Live simply. Keep your affairs in order so that the world will require less from you, so that you will have the time, energy and attention necessary for learning greater things. Give what you must give. Do your work, but maintain time for your development, for this is preparing the way for something greater.</p>
<p>避免否认你的世俗责任。只是不要让它们超越你。生活要简单。保持你的事务井然有序，这样世界对你的要求就会减少，这样你就会有必要的时间、能量和注意力来学习更多的精神性。给予你必须给予的礼物。做好你的工作，但要为你的发展保留时间，因为这是为更大的事情做准备。</p>
<p>Next, avoid impatience. Everyone is impatient when they begin. Everyone wants tremendous results with a minimal investment. Everyone wants a bargain from life where they have to give very little and get a great deal. Everyone wants to be comfortable and yet have all the rewards of an inspired life. Learn patience. You do not yet know what has to be unlearned and what has to be learned. You do not yet know how great the mountain is because when you are on the mountain, you can rarely see the summit. In fact, when you are on the mountain, you do not even know what it looks like as a whole. You just keep climbing. You keep going. You follow Knowledge. If Knowledge is quiet, you are quiet. If Knowledge is being still, you are being still. If Knowledge is moving, you are moving. If Knowledge does not respond, you do not respond. This is freedom of an unparalleled quality.</p>
<p>其次，避免急躁。每个人在开始时都很急躁。每个人都希望以最小的投资获得巨大的成果。每个人都想从生活中得到便宜，他们必须付出很少的代价而得到很大的好处。每个人都想过得舒服，但又想拥有一个有灵感的生命的所有回报。学会忍耐。你还不知道什么是必须放弃的，什么是必须学会的。你还不知道这座山有多大，因为当你在山上时，你很少能看到山顶。事实上，当你在山上的时候，你甚至不知道它的整体是什么样子。你只是不断地攀登。你继续前进。你跟随内识。如果内识是安静的，你就是安静的。如果内识是静止的，你就是静止的。如果内识在动，你就在动。如果内识不回应，你就不回应。这是一种无可比拟的自由。</p>
<p>When you are impatient, you are exerting your personal will. You are trying to make things happen. You are impatient for the great rewards even though you have barely begun the journey. You are thinking of ways to elevate yourself to the top of the mountain. You are scheming and planning how you can get there without having to take the journey itself. These thoughts may pass through your mind infrequently or frequently. Recognize them for what they are and do not give them credibility.</p>
<p>当你不耐烦的时候，你在施展你的个人意志。你正试图使事情发生。你对巨大的回报感到不耐烦，尽管你的旅程才刚刚开始。你在想办法把自己提升到山顶。你在谋划和计划如何才能到达那里，而不需要进行旅行本身。这些想法可能不经常或经常在你的心灵中闪现。认识到它们是什么，不要给它们可信度。</p>
<p>Next, avoid thinking that you do not know something when in fact you do know it. Until you have really penetrated and investigated a problem or a question in life, do not say you do not know. Do not throw up your hands and say, “I don’t know. How am I supposed to know?” until you have looked into it. If it is something important and requires your attention, then look into it. Perhaps you know nothing; perhaps you know a little; perhaps you know a great deal. People disclaim what they know and claim other things that are far beyond their reach, and they cannot tell the difference because they are only dealing with things at the level of ideas and not at the level of deeper experience. At the level of ideas you can have anything, be anything, do anything, want anything, assume anything or associate with anything because you are functioning at the level of imagination. You are dreaming. However, your deeper experience gives a more accurate representation of where you are, what you know and what you don’t know, what you have and what you don’t have.</p>
<p>其次，避免认为你不知道某件事情，而事实上你确实知道它。在你真正深入了解和调查生命中的一个问题或疑问之前，不要说你不知道。不要举起你的手说，”我不知道。我怎么会知道呢？”直到你研究了它。如果它是重要的事情，需要你的关注，那么就去研究它。也许你什么都不知道；也许你知道一点；也许你知道很多。人们否认他们所知道的，并声称其他事情远远超出他们的能力范围，他们无法分辨，因为他们只是在想法层面上处理事情，而不是在更深的经验层面上。在想法的层面上，你可以拥有任何东西，成为任何人，做任何事情，想要任何东西，假设任何事情或与任何人交往，因为你是在想象的层面上运作。你是在做梦。然而，你的更深层经验能更准确地反映出你在哪里，你知道什么和不知道什么，你拥有什么和不拥有什么。</p>
<p>Next, avoid making assumptions. As you advance, you will see how you make assumptions and you will become more aware of why you make them. Before that, you will simply make assumptions and be drawn into them. As you become more aware and more present to yourself in the moment, you will see your mind weaving a wonderful new idea, and you will be able to stop yourself and say, “No. No, I don’t think so.” People are drawn to whatever looks attractive within their imagination and within the world.</p>
<p>接下来，避免做假设。随着你的进步，你会看到你是如何做出假设的，你会更加意识到你为什么会做出这些假设。在此之前，你会简单地做出假设并被卷入其中。随着你变得更有意识，更多地在当下面对你自己，你会看到你的心灵在编织一个美妙的新想法，你将能够阻止你自己并说，”不，不，我不这么认为。”人们会被他们想象中和世界中看起来有吸引力的想法所吸引。</p>
<p>Do not make assumptions. Look. Occasionally you will know something. That is enough. In the meantime, the mind will want to create and create and create and fill in all the spaces with its explanations, goals, plans and everything else. Learn to be still. You do not know this journey. You are only following it. You are learning it as you go. You may think you understand where you have just been, but you will not understand this fully until you have gotten further up the mountain and can see where you were within the context of the greater aspects of your journey. Let your mind be open and quiet. Keep it simple.</p>
<p>不要做假设。去看。偶尔你会知道一些事情。这就够了。在此期间，心灵会想要创造、创造、创造，用它的解释、目标、计划和其他一切来填补所有的空间。学习静心。你并不知道这个旅程。你只是在跟随它。你在边走边学。你可能认为你理解你刚刚去过的地方，但你不会完全理解这一点，直到你在山上走得更远，并能在你旅程的更大范围内看到你在哪里。让你的心灵开放和安静。保持简单。</p>
<p>Within these things that we have mentioned, you will find other things that you will need to recognize and perhaps avoid. And you will recognize things that you need to claim. However, you will find as you proceed that your life will become simpler and simpler. You will be more focused and will have fewer things to think about. As you have fewer things to think about, and as your mind becomes more powerful and focused, your vision and experience will become more penetrating. You will be freed from being distracted by most of the things that captured your attention and your imagination before. And you will become stronger, for power is concentration, whether it is used for good or for evil.</p>
<p>在我们提到的这些事情中，你会发现其他的事情，你将需要认识到，也许会避免。而且你会认识到你需要要求的关系。然而，你会发现随着你的进展，你的生活将变得越来越简单。你将更加专注，并将有更少的事情需要考虑。当你有更少的事情需要思考，当你的心灵变得更加强大和集中，你的视野和经历将变得更加透彻。你将摆脱被以前吸引你的注意力和想象力的大多数事情的干扰。而且你会变得更强大，因为力量是集中的，无论它是用于善还是用于恶。</p>
<p>Knowledge will make what seems insurmountable and confusing simple, day by day. It will not explain things to you; it will simply demonstrate what is true. It will not fill your mind with great explanations and cosmologies, levels of existence and being and so forth. It will empty out your mind so that you can be present, so that you can see and know and so that Knowledge and your mind can work together.</p>
<p>内识将使看似不可逾越和令人困惑的事情变得简单，日复一日。它不会向你解释事情；它将简单地证明什么是真实的。它不会用巨大的解释和宇宙论、存在和存在的层级等等来填充你的心灵。它将清空你的心灵，以便你能够在场，使你能够看见和知道，使内识和你的心灵能够一起工作。</p>
<p>You will want to avoid these things that we have mentioned because they hold you back, because they gamble your existence and because they waste your life. Here you will learn to say “yes” or “no,” instead of “good” or “bad.” There is a world of difference between these two evaluations. You will say “yes” when yes is needed. You will say “no” when yes is not present. You will stay close to life and close to Knowledge. You will travel light, and your pace will quicken. You will pass by many things that would have stopped you before. And you will no longer recognize many things that drew you in previously. This represents advancement. This is what awaits you as you proceed.</p>
<p>你会想要避免我们提到的这些事情，因为它们阻碍了你，因为它们在赌你的存在，因为它们浪费你的生命。在这里你将学会说”是”或”不是”，而不是”好”或”坏”。这两种评价之间有天壤之别。当需要”是”的时候，你会说”是”。当”是”不存在时，你会说”不”。你将贴近生命，贴近内识。你将轻装上阵，你的步伐将加快。你将经过许多以前会阻止你的障碍。而且你将不再认识许多以前吸引你的关系。这代表着进步。这就是等待你前进的内识。</p>
<p>As your mind becomes more focused and less distracted, you will begin to demonstrate a greater power and a greater certainty that will permeate whatever action is yours to take and whatever contribution is yours to make. And Grace will be with you, for Grace is wholehearted and comes from beyond the world.</p>
<p>随着你心灵变得更加集中，不再分心，你将开始显示出更大的力量和更大的确定性，这将贯穿于你要采取的任何行动和你要做出的任何贡献。而恩典将与你同在，因为恩典是全心全意的，来自于世界之外。</p>
