<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on November 6, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年11月6日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grace must be a presence and an intelligence that can enter into and abide in any situation, in any world, in any climate, in any condition, in any culture and in any race. It must be something that can enter silently and abide with circumstances as they are. It must be something that can enter at the invitation of a genuine and sincere request. It must be something that can abide with a man or woman of Knowledge, something that can abide with them without dominating them and exist with them and in them without manipulating them. It must abide with them in such a way that the authority of the person who is its recipient is not overshadowed or usurped. Grace must be something that can be translated from one mind to another and transferred from one world to another.</p>
<p>恩典必须是一种能够进入并存在于任何情况、任何世界、任何气候、任何条件、任何文化和任何种族中的存在和智能。它必须是能够悄然进入并与现有环境共存的智能。它必须是能够应真诚请求而进入的存在。它必须是能与有内识的男人或女人共处的存在，它能与他们共处而不支配他们，与他们一起存在，在他们里面而不操纵他们。它必须以这样一种方式与他们同在，即作为其接收者的人的权威不会被掩盖或篡夺。恩典必须是能够从一个心灵传递到另一个心灵，并从一个世界传递到另一个世界的内识。</p>
<p>What can possibly do all of these things? A greater presence that can abide with but not overwhelm the person who is receiving it. A greater intelligence that can exist with but not dominate the lesser intelligence that is receiving it. A greater intensity and motivation in life that can gently persuade and nourish an emerging sense of real purpose, meaning and direction in the life of the person who is receiving it.</p>
<p>什么能够做到所有这些事情？一种更伟大的存在，能够与收到它的人共存但不会压倒他。一种更高的智能，能够与接纳它的较低智能共存但不支配它。一种更大的生命强度和更大动力，能够温和地使你信服并滋养接收它的人正在涌现的真正目的、意义和方向感</p>
<p>Grace must be something very powerful because it inspires individuals to do great and selfless acts. It inspires them to do things that transcend their own personal interests, limitations and concerns, and yet it in no way violates their own authority. Grace respects their own position in life while giving them a greater ability and a greater scope of awareness. Grace must be something very intelligent to give this strength without overwhelming the recipient.</p>
<p>恩典必须是非常强大的，因为它激励个人去做伟大而无私的行为。它激励他们做超越个人利益、限制和关切的事情，但却丝毫不侵犯他们的自主权。恩典尊重他们自己在生命中的位置，同时给予他们更大的能力和更大的意识范围。恩典必须是非常智能的，能够在不压倒接收者的情况下给予这种力量。</p>
<p>Grace must be something that is not concerned with the appearance of things. It must be something that has a greater origin, meaning and ability, beyond the scope of any worldly race, culture, tribe or group. Surely this cannot be a human invention. Surely this cannot be the product of a purely human god. Surely this cannot conform to human expectations or human images. It must be something far greater and more permeating, more transcendent and yet more able to descend into the world, into any world, where it is welcomed and needed.</p>
<p>恩典必须是一种与事物的表象无关的创造。它必须有更伟大的起源、意义和能力，超越任何世俗的种族、文化、部落或群体。当然，这不可能是人类的发明。当然，这不可能是纯粹人类神灵的产物。当然，这不可能符合人类的期望或人类的形象。它必须是一种更伟大、更有渗透力、更超凡脱俗但又更能降临到世界上的创造，降临到任何一个世界上，降临到欢迎和需要它的地方。</p>
<p>Grace represents the evidence of the greater relationship that you have with the Creator. Grace is not your possession. You cannot use it, harness it, manipulate it or direct it, for it represents a Greater Will and purpose in the universe.</p>
<p>恩典代表了你与创造之间更伟大关系的证据。恩典不是你的财产。你不能使用它，驾驭它，操纵它或引导它，因为它代表了宇宙中的一个更伟大的意志和目的。</p>
<p>You possess a special kind of Grace within you. This Grace is called out of you in the presence of the Grace that exists around you. It is called out of you to meet specific needs in the world. And it is called out of you to initiate, establish and strengthen the important relationships that you will need to have in order to find your greater purpose and mission here. The Grace within you is Knowledge, the Knowing Mind, the Mind that is a part of the Mind of the Creator.</p>
<p>你的内心拥有一种特殊的恩典。在你周围存在的恩典面前，这种恩典被召唤出来。它被召唤出来以满足世界上的特定需求。它被召唤出来，以启动、建立和加强你需要的重要关系，以便在这里找到你更伟大的目的和使命。你内心的恩典是内识，是知道的心智，是创造心智的一部分。</p>
<p>The response to Grace generates Grace. It is not the source of Grace. It is part of the mechanism of Grace which enables you to receive it, desire it and welcome it into your life. You look for Grace; you cannot find it. You open yourself to Grace, and it appears. You claim Grace for yourself, and it is nowhere to be found. You yield yourself to Grace, and Grace gently emerges. You speak the truth—the truth of what you really know, not the truth of what you want or believe—and Grace is standing beside you. You reach out and genuinely touch another’s heart, and Grace envelops both of you. You look at the events of your world with compassion and deep understanding, and Grace looks with you. You respond to a greater need in another, and somehow Grace speaks through you. It is neither within you nor beyond you exclusively. It is more that you are immersed in it, and at special moments you are able to experience this immersion, this already existing union with life.</p>
<p>对恩典的回应产生了恩典。它不是恩典的来源。它是恩典机制的一部分，使你能够收到它，渴望它并欢迎它进入你的生命。你寻找恩典；你找不到它。你向恩典开放自己，它就会出现。你为自己索取恩典，它却无处可寻。你向恩典屈服，恩典就轻轻地来到。你说出真理——你真正知道的真理，而不是你想要或相信的真理——恩典就站在你的身边。你伸出手来，真诚地触摸另一个人的内心，恩典笼罩着你们两个人。你用同情心和深刻的理解来看待你世界的事件，而恩典与你一起看。你对另一个人的更大需求作出回应，恩典就通过你说话。它既不在你之内，也不完全在你之外。更多的是你沉浸在其中，在特殊时刻你能经历到这种沉浸，这种已经存在的与生命的结合。</p>
<p>Grace does not come and go, except in your awareness. Grace is not here at this moment and then gone the next. Grace does not go around the universe visiting individuals here and there. Grace is present everywhere, at every moment. It seems to appear because there is an opening for it and a need for it. It comes because it is genuinely desired. It abides with you, and yet how seldom you experience its presence.</p>
<p>恩典不会来也不会去，除了在你的意识中。恩典不是这一刻在这里，下一刻就消失。恩典不会在宇宙中走来走去，拜访这里和那里的个人。恩典无处不在，每时每刻都存在。它的出现是因为有一个开口，有一个需要它的地方。它的出现是因为人们真正渴望它。它与你同在，但你却很少经历它的存在。</p>
<p>Grace is with you, but it is in the background. It is in the background because it is giving you the freedom to find your way and to come to terms with your deeper inclinations and awareness in life. It is in the background as if it were twenty feet behind you. It is not really twenty feet behind you, but this may be how you will experience it. It seems to come into your consciousness as you are available to it and as the situations that you are in call for it.</p>
<p>恩典与你同在，但它是在后台。它在后台，因为它给了你自由，让你找到自己的路，并与你更深的倾向和生命意识达成一致。它在背景中，就好像它在你身后20英尺。它并不是真的在你身后二十英尺，但这可能是你将经历到的。它似乎在你可以使用它的时候和你所处的情况需要它的时候进入你的意识。</p>
<p>Grace always emphasizes and validates your relationship with another and with the Creator. In fact, you may think of Grace as the evidence of genuine and abiding relationship. When you experience this relationship with yourself, with another or with the greater panorama of life, you will feel Grace—a sense of wholeness, completeness and inclusion, a sense of reunion and gratitude. These are all the evidence of Grace, all the evidence that a greater and more permeating relationship is being recognized, acknowledged and experienced.</p>
<p>恩典总是强调和验证你与他人以及与创造的关系。事实上，你可以认为恩典是真正的、持久的关系证据。当你经历到与自己、与他人或与更伟大的生命全景的这种关系时，你会感觉到恩典——一种完整、圆满和包容的感觉，一种团圆和感激的感觉。这些都是恩典的证据，都是更大、更渗透的关系正在被认出、承认和经历的证据。</p>
<p>Grace, then, is the evidence of God’s presence in the world. However, even more important than this, it is the evidence of your intrinsic relationship with the Creator. Grace is the evidence of Knowledge within yourself because you are able to receive it and respond to it. Eventually, as you become strong with Knowledge, if you can follow the way to Knowledge and take the steps to Knowledge, then you will be able to actually dispense Grace into the world, not as a conscious act, but as something that happens spontaneously. Here Grace will emerge from you because you will be a wellspring for Grace in the world.</p>
<p>那么，恩典就是上帝存在于世界的证据。然而，比这更重要的是，它是你与创造内在关系的证据。恩典是内识在你内心的证据，因为你能够接收它并对它作出回应。最终，当你的内识变得强大时，如果你能遵循内识的道路，采取内识的步骤，那么你将能够实际地将恩典传播到世界上。不是作为一种有意识的行为，而是作为一种自发发生的回应。在这里，恩典将从你身上涌现，因为你将成为世界上恩典的源泉。</p>
<p>No matter what your activity or specific endeavor in life, you can become a demonstration of the presence of Grace. This will have a great impact on those who can receive your gifts and on those who can witness your acts. Grace ignites Knowledge in others. It stimulates others at the deepest level of their being. It brings with it a memory and a confirmation, however long forgotten, that there is a greater purpose and meaning in life. It is part of the reality that you have brought with you from your Ancient home.</p>
<p>无论你在生活中从事什么活动或具体工作，你都可以成为恩典存在的示范。这将对那些能收到你的礼物的人和能见证你的行为的人产生巨大影响。恩典在他人身上点燃了内识。它在最深的层面上刺激他人的存在。它带来了一种记忆和确认，不管被遗忘多久，生命中有一个更伟大的目的和意义。它是你从古老的家园带来的现实的一部分。</p>
<p>The evidence and the demonstration of Grace call some people forward while others retreat and still others fight against their own experience. However, its power and efficacy cannot be denied. It has a potency in life that is unmatched by anything else. No one who feels it can be neutral regarding it. And everyone who witnesses it must respond.</p>
<p>证据和恩典的展示召唤一些人前进，而另一些人则退缩，还有一些人与自己的经历对抗。然而，它的力量和功效是不可否认的。它在生命中的效力是其他经历无法比拟的。任何感受到它的人都不可能对它保持中立。每个见证它的人都必须做出回应。</p>
<p>Grace is evidence of a greater union and relationship that you have with others, with the world and with your Creator, but Grace also is the potency that carries great ideas and great inspiration from one mind to another. Here it is like a conduit that enables the transmission of Knowledge to pass from one mind to another. This activates Knowledge in each person as it passes from one mind to another, like an electrical current passing through one terminal to another, carried by the power of Grace. Here your real associations with people become activated and evident.</p>
<p>恩典是你与他人、与世界和与你的创造有更大的结合和关系的证据，但恩典也是将伟大的想法和伟大的灵感从一个人的心灵带到另一个人的心灵的力量。在这里，它就像一个管道，使内识的传递从一个人的心灵传递到另一个人的心灵。当内识从一个人的心灵传递到另一个人的心灵时，这激活了每个人的内识，就像电流通过一个终端传到另一个终端一样，由恩典的力量携带。在这里，你与人的真正关联被激活，变得明显。</p>
<p>Grace seems to come and go, a momentary experience perhaps, something that is in great contrast to the vast majority of your experiences of being in the world. But it is always there. Think of it like this: It is as if the Greater Self in you and the greater relationship that you have with others momentarily became ignited, as if the ground were illuminated one dark night by flashes of lightning, and for those moments, you realized there is so much there that you could not see before. And after the momentary flashes, you return to darkness. But Grace, for that moment, that tiny moment, has illuminated your life and has given you a greater vision of what is present in your life, what is in the background of your life and how you really stand with things around you.</p>
<p>恩典似乎是来去匆匆的，或许只是一种短暂的体验，与大多数在世上的经历形成鲜明对比。但它一直存在。可以这样想：好像你内在的更高自我和你与他人之间的更大关系在某个瞬间被点燃了，就好像在一个黑暗的夜晚，地面被闪电照亮，在那一瞬间，你意识到这里有很多你以前看不到的关系。而在短暂的闪光之后，你又回到了黑暗之中。但是，恩典，在那一刻，那微小的瞬间，已经照亮了你的生命，让你对自己生命中的存在、你生命的背景以及你与周遭环境的真实关系有了更大的视野。</p>
<p>These flash points are very significant because they herald the possibility of a greater union and association with life, a greater involvement and endeavor with others and a greater experience of purpose in reality. This is an experience the world cannot give you, for it must be presented to you from the Greater Intelligence and Will of the universe. This Will transcends all Greater Community societies, all groups, all races and all other powers. It is the Will of the Creator as it is manifesting itself in the changing conditions of physical life.</p>
<p>这些闪光点是非常重要的，因为它们预示着与生命有更大的结合和关联的可能性，与他人有更大的参与与合作，以及在现实中更伟大的目的体验。这是世界无法给予你的经历，因为它必须由宇宙的更伟大智能和意志呈现给你。这个意志超越了所有的大社区社会、所有团体、所有种族和所有其他力量。它是创造的意志，正如它在物理生活的变化条件中显现出来的那样。</p>
<p>Welcome, then, the flash points of Wisdom. Welcome, then, the momentary demonstrations of Grace. Welcome, then, those experiences that can show you where you are, what you need to do and how you really stand with others. You can have this realization without judgment, without comparison and without condemnation of yourself or others, for Grace brings with it a confirmation, not a judgment. It brings with it a recognition of how things really are, not how you want them to be or expect them to be. Just as the lightning illuminates the ground around where you stand and shows you things you could not see in the darkness of your own personal perception, so Grace illuminates your way, giving you a greater understanding of where you are, who you are associating with and what you must do. It lights your way and it reassures you that your endeavor is not an individual one and that the world you see around you is not all that can be seen, felt and known. It shows you that the troubled interactions between people do not represent their real associations and their real possibilities together.</p>
<p>欢迎智慧的闪光点。欢迎恩典的瞬间展示。欢迎那些能够告诉你你身处何地、需要做什么以及你与他人真正关系如何的经历。你可以在没有判断、没有比较、也没有对自己或他人的谴责的情况下，获得这种领悟，因为恩典带来的是确认，而非评判。它带来的是对关系真实情况的认知，而不是你希望或期待的样子。就像闪电照亮了你所站立位置周围的地面，向你展示了你在个人感知的黑暗中看不到的环境，恩典也照亮了你的道路，让你更清晰地理解你所处的位置、你与谁共同相处，以及你必须做什么。它照亮你的道路，并让你放心，你的努力并非孤立的，你所看到的周围世界并不是你所能看到、感受到和知道的全部。它告诉你，人与人之间混乱的互动并不代表他们真正的联系，也不代表他们在一起的真正可能性。</p>
<p>Grace is the evidence of the Greater reality that permeates everything you see. However, you do not see this Greater reality because you are dominated by the reality that you do see, and you are dominated by your thoughts about that reality. A Greater reality becomes discovered when there is a desire for it and a preparation to reach it. It becomes discovered when there is a need for its presence and activity within the mundane appearances and activities of your life. This need, this recognition and this openness enable Grace to emerge. At first, it will emerge momentarily like great flashes of lightning. It will emerge momentarily like the sudden appearance of an angelic presence. It will emerge suddenly like a warm glow and a hazy feeling that you are not alone and that there is a real confirmation in what has just been said or done. You will feel it initially in a sudden feeling of rightness within yourself and in the sudden recognition and appreciation of another.</p>
<p>恩典是那无所不在的更大现实的证据，它渗透于你所见的一切。然而，你没有看到这个更大的现实，因为你被自己看到的现实所支配，你被自己对这个现实的感想所支配。当你渴望它并做好达到它的准备时，一个更大的现实就会被发现。当在你生命的世俗表象和活动中需要它的存在和活动时，它就会被发现。这种需求、这种认知和这种开放使得恩典得以显现。起初，它将像一道惊雷一样瞬间出现。它将像天使的突然出现一样瞬间显现。它将突然出现，就像一道温暖的阳光伴随着一种朦胧的感觉，让你感受到你并不孤单，刚刚发生的事或所说的话得到了真实的确认。最初，你会在自己内心突然产生的正确感中感受到它，也会在突然间对他人的肯定和欣赏中体会到它。</p>
<p>However, as you follow in The Way of Knowledge and as you take the steps to Knowledge, this experience will grow for you. It will grow most significantly because the seemingly great gulf between you and the Greater reality that permeates your life and that gives your life its real meaning and purpose is being penetrated. The veil that seems to separate you from this experience and awareness is slowly being dissolved.</p>
<p>然而，当你追随内识之路，当你迈向内识的步伐时，这种经历将会对你而言不断增长。它将显著增长，因为你与渗透在你生命中的、赋予你生命真正意义和目的的更大现实之间的看似巨大的鸿沟正在被穿透。似乎将你与这种经历和意识分开的面纱正在逐渐消失。</p>
<p>It is not that you will have more experiences of Grace in a momentary sense. It is that Grace will become closer and closer to you. The Greater reality and your personal reality will come closer and closer together. As they come closer and closer together, your personal reality will change and be strengthened. It will have a greater focus and a greater emphasis on meaning and accomplishment. This is where your values and your interests gradually change in a way that is so natural and life confirming for you that over time you will not doubt that a Greater Power is at work in your life.</p>
<p>这并不是说你会有更多的恩典经历，在一时的意义上。而是恩典将变得越来越接近你。更大的现实和你个人的现实将越来越接近。随着它们的逐渐接近，你的个人现实将会发生变化并得到加强。它将有一个更大的焦点，更强调意义和成就。在这个过程中，你的价值观和兴趣会逐渐以一种自然而又对生命肯定的方式进行改变，以至于随着时间的推移，你将不会怀疑有一种更伟大的力量在你的生命中发挥着作用。</p>
<p>You will see the evidence of this Greater Power in your own changing feelings and emphasis. You will see the evidence of this in your changing relationships and their changing emphasis. You will see the evidence of this in the presence of your deeper inclinations, which will now have greater access and greater expression in your personal mind and in your conscious experience. You will see the evidence of this in what you value and what you seek. You will seek things that are permanent and that are bonded with life. You will not seek to impose your individual will but to express a Greater Will that confirms your existence and that honors the presence of all who are here with you, regardless of their difficulties or their mistakes. This will give you an emphasis on forgiveness and accomplishment, on recognition and right decisions. This will be an entirely different emphasis than what you had felt before.</p>
<p>你将在自己变化的感受和强调中看到这更大力量的证据。你将在自己与他人关系的变化及它们变化的强调中看到这一证据。你将在自己更深层倾向的存在中看到这一证据，现在它们将在你的个人心灵和意识体验中得到更大的接触和表达。你将在自己所珍视和追求的事物中看到这一证据。你将寻求那些永恒而与生命紧密相连的关系。你不会试图强加个人意志，而是表达一种更大的意志，确认你的存在，并尊重与你同在的每一个人的存在，无论他们的困难或错误如何。这将使你强调宽恕和成就，强调肯定和正确的决策。这将与你之前感受到的完全不同。</p>
<p>Grace will be more and more with you, but in a subtle and pervasive way. Instead of flashes of lightning illuminating your life momentarily, it is as if a great dawning were occurring and the shadows of your life were gently being dissolved by the presence of a great light emerging on the horizon. Here the evidence of what is really in your life and where you really need to go slowly becomes realized.</p>
<p>恩典将越来越多地与你同在，但却是以一种微妙而普遍的方式。与其说是闪电瞬间照亮了你的生命，不如说是一个伟大的黎明正在发生，你生命中的阴影正被远处日出的光芒温柔地溶解。在这里，你生命中真正存在的证据和你真正需要前往的地方慢慢变得清晰。</p>
<p>Your decisions will either bring the experience of Grace or deny it. No matter how difficult your decisions are or how seemingly serious their consequences, when you make a decision that is in keeping with Knowledge, you will feel this presence with you. Perhaps you will feel anxiety about the anticipated or the imagined consequences, but you will feel a rightness in your life. This will give evidence that Grace is with you, for every decision that you make that is in keeping with Knowledge will acknowledge the presence of Grace in your life. Every determination that you make that is in keeping with the greater truth within you will give you a greater experience of this truth and a greater sense of its presence and activity in your life and in the world around you.</p>
<p>你的决定会带来恩典的经历，或者将其拒之门外。无论你的决定有多么艰难，或者它们似乎会带来多么严重的后果，当你做出符合内识的决定时，你会感受到这种存在与你同在。或许你会对预期的或想象中的后果感到焦虑，但你会感受到你的生命有一种正确性。这将是恩典与你同在的证据，因为你每做出一项符合内识的决定，就是在承认恩典在你生命中的存在。每一个你做出的决定，只要符合你内心更伟大的真理，都会给你带来更深的真理体验，增强你对真理在生命中及周围世界中存在和活动的感知。</p>
<p>Grace is something that is emerging slowly, like a very slow dawning of the light. Here things that seemed mysterious or incomprehensible before can be recognized, felt and known. Perhaps you cannot explain them because the experience is beyond words, but that is not so important now because you realize that an explanation can never illuminate the life of another.</p>
<p>恩典是正在缓慢出现的内识，就像非常缓慢的破晓。在这里，以前看似神秘或不可理解的内识可以被认知、感受和知道。也许你无法用言语解释它们，因为这种经验超越了语言的界限，但现在这并不重要，因为你意识到解释永远无法照亮他人的生命。</p>
<p>It is only the presence of Grace and the activity of Knowledge that can give others a greater experience and perception of their lives and a greater determination within themselves. Here you come to understand that Grace is the evidence of the Creator’s presence in the world—a presence that works behind the scenes and that does not overshadow, dominate or manipulate those who are here. This presence gently reassures people and calls upon Knowledge within each of them to enable them to respond and to learn the way of relationship, which is The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>只有恩典的存在和内识的活动才能让他人对自己的生命有更深的经验和感知，及在使他们内心深处产生更大的决心。在这里你会明白，恩典是创造在这个世界上存在的证据——创造在幕后工作，它不会掩盖、主宰或操控在这里的人。这个存在温柔地安抚人们，并唤起每个人内心的内识，使他们能够回应并学习关系之路，即内识之路。</p>
<p>There is Grace in your life, and to enable you to experience it and eventually to express it and generate it, you are presented with a preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Follow this preparation. Receive it, for this is the gift and the means that will bring you to a greater understanding and experience of your purpose and to the greater purpose in life of which you are a part.</p>
<p>在你的生命中存在着恩典，为了使你能够经历它，并最终表达它和产生它，你将在大社区内识之路中看到一个准备。跟随这个准备。接收它，因为这是礼物和方法，将使你更多地理解和体验你的目的，以及你所参与的更伟大的生命目的。</p>
<p>The answer to your prayers is a means of preparation. If you were sunk in a hole in the ground and could not climb out, the answer to your prayer would be a ladder sent down to enable you to find your way out. Being in the world is like being in a deep, dark hole in the ground. All you see is the darkness and the confinement of that which entraps you. The answer to your prayer for freedom, for resolution, for peace, for strength and for accomplishment is a ladder sent down to you—a ladder which you must climb, a ladder which will lift you out of your seemingly hopeless circumstances into a greater experience of where you have been, where you can go and what can be done.</p>
<p>对你祷告的回应是一种准备。如果你陷在地洞里爬不出来，那么对你祷告的回应就是送你一架梯子，让你找到出路。身处世界就像身处一个深不见底的地洞。你所看到的只是黑暗和困住你的禁锢。你为自由、决心、和平、力量和成就所做的祈祷——其答案就是一架梯子，一架你必须攀登的梯子，一架将把你从看似无望的环境中提升到对你已经去过的地方、你能去的地方和能做的事情的更大经验的梯子。</p>
<p>Grace brings with it the means for experiencing it. It is not something you simply beg for and is given to you in little tiny increments. Grace is given to you because the preparation for it is given to you. You must find your way to it. It is with you, but you are not with it. This demonstrates the great dilemma of your life and the most serious problem of your life—that Knowledge is with you, but you are not with Knowledge. Grace is with you, but you are not with Grace. Real relationship is with you, but you are not with real relationship.</p>
<p>恩典带来了经历它的方法。它不是你简单地祈求，然后在一点一滴中得到的体验。恩典之所以给你，是因为它的准备已经给了你。你必须找到通往它的道路。它与你同在，但你并不与它同在。这展示了你生命中的巨大困境和最严重的问题——内识与你同在，但你并没有与内识同在。恩典与你同在，但你并没有与恩典同在。真正的关系与你同在，但你并没有与真正的关系在一起。</p>
<p>Where can you possibly be if you are not being with what really is? Where can you possibly be if you are not being with the Greater reality that is the foundation, meaning and context of your life? The only place that you can be is in your thoughts. And your thoughts weave themselves around your awareness until they are all that you can see. They govern your perception, and they govern your behavior. They determine your goals and aspirations. Your thoughts represent the hole in the ground and the walls around you that block your vision, that contain your experience and that limit your freedom and your ability to be in meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>如果你不与真正的关系在一起，你可能在哪里？如果你不与作为你生命的基础、意义和背景的更大的现实在一起，你可能在哪里？你唯一可以存在的地方就是你的心声。你的感想围绕着你的意识编织，直到它们成为你能看到的一切。它们支配着你的感知，也支配着你的行为。它们决定了你的目标和愿望。你的感想代表了地下的地洞和你周围的墙，它们阻挡了你的视野，涵盖了你的经验，限制了你的自由和你在有意义的关系中的能力。</p>
<p>To be lifted out of this situation requires preparation, and it requires you to follow this preparation because you yourself must climb out. In this, you will regain your strength, your determination, your perseverance and your true will born of Knowledge. Here you learn the way of escape, not from the world, but from the contradiction of being dominated by your own personal mind.</p>
<p>要从这种境况中摆脱出来，需要准备，也需要你自己跟随这种准备，因为你必须自己爬出来。在这个过程中，你会重拾你的力量、决心、毅力和由内识诞生的真实意愿。在这里，你学会了逃避的方式，不是逃离这个世界，而是逃离被自己个人心智支配的矛盾状态。</p>
<p>Grace reminds you that this is possible. Grace enables your escape to take place, and Grace encourages you to proceed. The door to your prison cell is open. You can push it open at any time. You can walk out into the light of day. For this to happen, however, you must be willing to have a different experience of yourself and a different determination within you. You must be open and desiring of a greater life—a life that is not in keeping with your past and that will bring you out of the confinement of living within your personal mind. As a result of this escape, even your personal mind will be refreshed, renewed and restored, for your personal mind’s greater purpose is to serve Knowledge. Your personal mind, like your personal body, is a temporary vehicle in life. Its greatest service, its greatest union and its greatest security are born of its service to a Greater Power—the Greater Power that assures your reality, your mission, your origin and your destiny.</p>
<p>恩典提醒你这是可能的。恩典使你的逃脱得以发生，恩典鼓励你继续前进。你牢房的门是打开着的。你可以在任何时候推开它。你可以走出去，进入光明的世界。然而，要做到这一点，你必须愿意对自己有不同的经历，在你内心有不同的决心。你必须敞开心扉，渴望更伟大的生命——一种与你的过去不一致的生命，这种生命将使你摆脱生活在你个人心智中的禁锢。作为这种逃离的结果，甚至你的个人心智也将被刷新、更新和恢复，因为你的个人心智的更伟大的目的是为内识服务。你的个人心智，就像你的个人身体，是生命中的一个临时载体。它最伟大的服务、最伟大的结合和最伟大的安全是源于它对一种更伟大的力量的服务——这种更伟大的力量保证了你的现实、你的使命、你的起源和你的天命。</p>
<p>This Greater Power is with you now. Knowledge is with you now. Grace is with you now. The Creator is with you now. The relationships that you will truly need in life exist now. You must find your way to them, and they will find their way to you. Find the way to Knowledge, and Knowledge will be able to emerge into your mind. Find your way to Grace, and Grace will have a place to abide with you—not just momentarily but permanently, as it is meant to.</p>
<p>这个更伟大的力量现在就在你身边。内识现在与你同在。恩典现在与你同在。创造现在与你同在。你在生命中真正需要的关系现在就存在。你必须找到通往它们的道路，它们也会找到通往你的路。找到通往内识的道路，内识就能出现在你的心灵中。找到通往恩典的道路，恩典就会有地方与你同在——不只是暂时的，而是持久的，因为它是注定的。</p>
<p>The experience that we are speaking of can only be realized as you open yourself to it and as you become truly honest about your deeper inclinations. Here we must give a greater definition of honesty: honesty is not only knowing what you feel; honesty is feeling what you know. Here your personal mind and the deeper mind that is your true nature touch each other, and there is Grace. Here there is sobriety about life. There is quiet awareness. And there are deeper feelings and motivations.</p>
<p>我们所说的经历只有在你对它敞开心扉，对你的深层倾向变得真正诚实时才能实现。在这里，我们必须给诚实下一个更大的定义：诚实不仅是知道你的感受；诚实是感受你所知道的。在这里，你的个人心智和作为你真实本性的深层心智相互接触，并且产生恩典。这里有对生命的清醒。有安静的意识。还有更深的感受和动机。</p>
<p>As you touch Knowledge—your Greater Self and your greater association with life—then Grace will be experienced. Knowledge takes you to Grace again and again, not as a momentary experience, not as a highlight of a long and dreary life and not only as a flash of lightning, but as an abiding reality and experience within yourself. You can find a way to Knowledge because a way has been given. You can take the steps to Knowledge because the steps have been given. This is the work of Grace, for Grace would be incomplete if it did not give you the means for its total realization and experience. The Creator would be leaving you out in the cold of life if a way to the Creator were not given to you.</p>
<p>当你接触到内识——你的大我和你与生命的更大关联时——便会经历恩典。内识一次又一次地将你带到恩典之中，不是作为短暂的体验，不是作为漫长而沉闷生命的亮点，也不仅仅是一道闪电，而是作为你内在的恒久现实和体验。你可以找到通向内识的道路，因为这条道路已经给予了你。你可以踏上通往内识的阶梯，因为阶梯已经被给予。这是恩典的工作，因为如果恩典没有给予你其完全实现和经历的方法，那么恩典将是不完整的。如果没有给予你通向创造的方式，创造将会把你留在生命的寒冬里。</p>
<p>The evidence of Grace is expressed in those wonderful and reassuring moments when a greater truth is experienced and a greater association and relationship with life is felt. However, the evidence of Grace is more completely substantiated by your realization that you have a great need to fulfill your purpose and mission here and that this need is more powerful and more urgent than anything else that you feel or recognize.</p>
<p>恩典的证据表现在那些美妙和令人欣慰的时刻，即经历到更伟大的真理，感受到与生命的更大关联和更大关系。然而，恩典的证据更完全地体现在你意识到自己有一个伟大的需求来完成你在这里的目的和使命，而且这个需求比你感受到的或认识到的任何需求都更强大、更紧迫。</p>
<p>This great need calls for and readies you to prepare. It gives you a new direction and a new impetus. It calls God to you, and it calls you to God. It calls you to those significant people that you will need in your life, and it calls them to you. It is as if a great switch had been thrown and all of a sudden a whole new set of factors come into play. Subtle will be your experience of them at first, but you will know within yourself that something has changed. You turned a corner somewhere. You crossed an invisible line. Something happened to you somewhere back there. Now you feel a little bit different. There is something growing and emerging within you, a deeper experience from a part of you that you can barely recognize and certainly cannot define.</p>
<p>这种巨大的需求呼唤你做好准备。它给你一个新的方向和新的动力。它将上帝召唤到你身边，也将你召唤到上帝身边。它把你召唤到你生命中那些重要的人身边，同时也把他们召唤到你身边。就像是打开了一个巨大的开关，突然之间一整套全新的因素开始发挥作用。起初，你对它们的经历可能是微妙的，但你会在自己内心深处感觉到，某些关系已经改变了。你在某个地方转了个弯。你越过了一条看不见的界线。在某个时刻，有些关系发生在你身上。现在你感觉有些不同了。有一种关系在你内心生长和浮现，它来自你的某个部分，你几乎认不出它，当然也无法定义它。</p>
<p>Your great need and the great need of the universe have just recognized each other. As a result of this recognition, a greater purpose is stimulated—a purpose that you will have to carry like a great pregnancy and that you will have to labor with to a certain degree in order to bring it forth into the world. It will change your ideas, and it will alter your experience, but only to bring them into a greater resonance and a greater relationship with the purpose that you carry, the mission that you serve and the life to which you are intrinsically and forever bonded. Then you will come to know Grace not only as a momentary experience, but as an activity in your life. And your understanding of this will grow and expand as you are able to proceed.</p>
<p>你的伟大需求和宇宙的伟大需求只是彼此认出了对方。作为这种认识的结果，一个更伟大的目的被激发出来——一个你将不得不像一个的孕妇怀孕一样承载的伟大目的，你将不得不付出一定程度的努力来将它带到世界上。它会改变你的想法，改变你的经验，但只是为了让它们与你携带的目的、你服务的使命以及你内在永恒的生命更加和谐地联系在一起。然后你将会知道恩典，不仅仅是一种短暂的经历，而是你生命中的一种活动。随着你的进展，你对恩典的理解将会不断加深和扩展。</p>
<p>Here Grace will be something that you can identify, even during those moments when you cannot feel it directly, because you will know it is there. This will not require belief as much as it will require acceptance. Here you will not be trying to believe in something you cannot experience. Instead, you will be trying to accept something that you know is in your life. And you will know it is in your life because you will have experienced it increasingly and because you will have seen the evidence of its work within you and around you. This is the silent, subtle activity of the Creator reclaiming the separated through Knowledge. It is renewing you and others by the activation of a greater awareness and a greater purpose that has brought you into the world—a purpose in keeping with the evolution of life, a purpose that is yours to find and to discover.</p>
<p>在这里，即使在你无法直接感受到恩典的时刻，你也能辨认出恩典，因为你知道它就在那里。这并不需要信仰，而是需要接受。在这里，你不会试图去相信你无法体验的关系。相反，你将努力接受你知道存在于你生命中的关系。你会知道它就在你的生命中，因为你会越来越多地体验到它，因为你会看到它在你内心和周围发挥作用的证据。这是创造通过内识重新找回分离者的无声而微妙的活动。它正在通过激活更强大的意识和更伟大的目的来启动你和其他人，而这正是把你带到这个世界的目的——一个与生命进化相一致的目的，一个由你去发现和探索的目的。</p>
<p>The real confirmation of Grace will come as you are able to realize that there has been a greater intervention and support in your life to enable you to meet a greater need and a greater desire. This will renew your awareness that you are in relationship with something very significant here. Then Grace will not merely be a momentary and dramatic experience, but instead will become the living foundation of your life.</p>
<p>当你能够意识到，你的生命中已经有了更大的干预和支持，使你能够满足更大的需求和更大的愿望时，恩典才会真正得到确认。这将使你重新意识到，你在这里与非常重要的内识发生了关系。然后，恩典就不仅仅是一时的戏剧性体验，而是成为你生命的基石。</p>
