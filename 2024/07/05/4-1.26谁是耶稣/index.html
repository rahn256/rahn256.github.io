<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on November 6, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年11月6日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus represents a major figure in the evolution of the world, an initiator—one of the principle initiators of a great period that is now coming to a close in the world. Let us talk about Jesus within the context of the evolution of the world, for this will give you a greater understanding of his role and of the great results that have been demonstrated by his life and by the translation of Knowledge that he helped generate.</p>
<p>耶稣代表了世界演变中的一个重要人物，他是一个发起者，是世界上即将结束的一个伟大时期的主要发起人。让我们在世界演变的背景下谈论耶稣，因为这将使你更多地理解他的作用，以及他的生命和他帮助产生的内识转化所显示的巨大成果。</p>
<p>Jesus was sent into the world by his Spiritual Family to be one of the individuals who would inaugurate a new era in human development and evolution. We call this the era of civilization. The purpose of this era was to slowly take humanity from its tribal identity and tribal isolation towards an international and interracial involvement. This international and interracial involvement has been cataclysmic and very difficult, but it has led to humanity’s becoming established in the world—not only in its tribal states, but in its larger states representing many races and cultures, ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p>耶稣被他的精神家庭派往来到这个世界上，成为开创人类发展和进化新纪元的人之一。我们称之为文明时代。这个时代的目的是将人类从部落身份和部落隔离中慢慢带向国际和跨种族的参与。这种国际和跨种族的参与是灾难性的，也是非常困难的，但它使人类在世界上站稳了脚跟——不仅是在其部落国家，而且是在代表许多种族和文化、思想和信仰的更大世界中。</p>
<p>Christianity and all the other major religions have fostered a bridge between cultures and between races. These are not simply religions of one tribe or one group. They are religions for all of humanity. This is not to say that everyone can adhere to them, follow them or receive them, but they bridge the normal boundaries that seem to separate people and cast them apart. The religion of forgiveness, the religion of reunion with the Divine, the religion of human development, the religion of compassion—all of these tremendous movements in the evolution of religion in the world were fostered by the establishment of the world’s religions, which have brought the world to its present state.</p>
<p>基督教和所有其他主要宗教在不同文化和种族之间架起了一座桥梁。它们不仅仅是一个部落或一个群体的宗教。它们是全人类的宗教。这并不是说每个人都可以信奉它们、追随它们或接受它们，而是说它们弥合了似乎将人们分开、将他们隔离的正常界限。宽恕的宗教、与神团聚的宗教、人类发展的宗教、同情心的宗教——所有这些在世界宗教演变中的巨大运动都是由世界宗教的建立所促进的，这些宗教使世界达到了目前的状态。</p>
<p>Perhaps you might think that the world is in a terrible state now and that not much has been done to bring humanity to a greater union. However, if you could understand how life was in your world twenty-five hundred years ago, you would see how very far you have come. You would see how much your races have intermingled and how much they have found a new basis and foundation for sharing their ideas and their deeper yearnings and inclinations.</p>
<p>也许你会认为，现在的世界状况很糟糕，没有做多少事情来让人类更加团结。但是，如果你们能够了解2500年前你们世界的生活状况，你就会知道你们已经走过了多么漫长的道路。你会看到，你们的种族已经有了多么大的交融，他们已经找到了一个新的基础，可以分享他们的思想和更深层次的渴望和倾向。</p>
<p>As we have said repeatedly, religion must serve the world in its current state of evolution. The world’s major religions have all evolved the race towards a greater interaction between different peoples. This is especially true of Christianity, which has spanned your globe and now connects people who may otherwise have no association with one another. Now they have a common faith. Now they have common rituals and common observances. This is a remarkable accomplishment in a world that is still deeply mired in tribal identities.</p>
<p>正如我们反复说过的，宗教必须为处于当前进化状态的世界服务。世界上的主要宗教都使种族朝着不同民族之间更大的互动发展。基督教尤其如此，它已经跨越了你们的全球，现在将那些原本可能没有任何联系的人联系在一起。现在他们有一个共同的信仰。现在他们有共同的仪式和共同的纪念活动。在一个仍然深陷于部落身份的世界里，这是一个了不起的成就。</p>
<p>The teaching of compassion, forgiveness, and devotion and the example of Jesus all serve to unite people across these great and difficult gaps of separation. Jesus’ accomplishment, then, was to help usher in the age of civilization. Civilization in this age is distinct from earlier civilizations which were primarily tribal civilizations. In your current age, civilizations involve not only one tribe and one language, one group or one family, but bridge far beyond these boundaries. And though humanity has quarreled and struggled with itself through all of these transitions and developments, a greater foundation nonetheless has been established for human experience beyond tribal custom and identity.</p>
<p>怜悯、宽恕和奉献的教导以及耶稣的榜样，都有助于使人们跨越这些巨大而艰难的分离鸿沟而团结起来。因此，耶稣的成就是帮助开创了文明时代。这个时代的文明与早期文明不同，早期文明主要是部落文明。在你们这个时代，文明不仅涉及一个部落和一种语言，一个团体或一个家庭，而且是远远超出这些界限的桥梁。尽管人类在所有这些过渡和发展中与自己争吵和挣扎，但还是为人类经历建立了一个超越部落习俗和身份的更大基础。</p>
<p>At the time that Christianity was introduced, it was revolutionary. Its emphasis was to spread its message amongst nations and amongst different peoples. It was not only meant for one group or one locale. It was not only meant for one tribe or one nation. Its emphasis was to bridge the gaps between different cultures and different nations, to bond people together through a higher association in life and to create a greater foundation for recognition, communication and cooperation. Humanity has been struggling with this challenge ever since, but much progress has been made.</p>
<p>在基督教被引入的时候，它是革命性的。它的重点是在国家和不同民族之间传播其讯息。它不仅仅是为一个群体或一个地区而设。它不仅仅是为了一个部落或一个国家。它的重点是弥合不同文化和不同民族之间的差距，通过生命中更高的关联将人们联系在一起，并为认可、交流与合作创造一个更大的基础。从那时起，人类一直在与这一挑战作斗争，但已经取得了很大进展。</p>
<p>Jesus set into motion a direct relationship with the Divine through the intermediary of the Holy Spirit, which in Greater Community understanding would be defined as Knowledge itself. This relationship emphasized the Divine reality within each person and the possibility for personal revelation and spiritual development. Humanity has been struggling with this ever since, yet it is a remarkable achievement that Christianity is present in the world and that it is accepted by millions of people in different countries, from different cultures and backgrounds. This is a religion for international civilization, as is true of many of the other religious movements that were initiated in the world and that have advanced into a more modern age.</p>
<p>耶稣通过圣灵的中介，启动了与上帝的直接关系，在大社区的理解中，圣灵将被定义为内识本身。这种关系强调了每个人内心的神性现实以及个人启示和精神上发展的可能性。人类从那时起就一直在与之斗争，然而，基督教存在于世界上，被不同国家、不同文化和背景的数百万人所接受，这是一个了不起的成就。这是一种国际文明的宗教，正如世界上发起的许多其他宗教运动一样，这些运动已经推进到了更现代的时代。</p>
<p>To understand Jesus’s contribution, we must look back and see what has occurred. Wisdom indeed can be gained in hindsight here. Life before Jesus and life after Jesus are different. There has been a remarkable change. This change took centuries to take full effect, but it did take full effect. In many instances, the spread of Christianity was destructive and immoral. However, it was following an evolutionary track. It had to happen. Just as the world is now preparing to emerge into the Greater Community, nations in centuries past were destined to interact with each other, to confront each other, to dominate each other and to spread their cultures around the world. This has happened to a very large degree.</p>
<p>为了理解耶稣的贡献，我们必须回顾过去，看看已经发生了什么。在这里确实可以获得事后的智慧。耶稣之前的生活和耶稣之后的生活是不同的。发生了显著的变化。这种变化花了几个世纪的时间才完全生效，但它确实完全生效了。在许多情况下，基督教的传播是破坏性的和不道德的。然而，它是沿着进化的轨道进行的。它必须要发生。正如世界现在正准备进入大社区一样，过去几个世纪的国家注定要相互影响，相互对抗，相互支配，并将其文化传播到世界各地。这在很大程度上已经发生了。</p>
<p>Now we have world religions rather than simply tribal religions. Given the evolutionary process of cultural and social development in the world, and given the progress and evolution of religious and spiritual understanding, you can see that this has been a great step forward. Religion must always keep pace with the evolution of the race which it is intended to serve. Its ability to do this or its inability to do this will determine how beneficial it will be and how great a service it will render.</p>
<p>现在我们有了世界性的宗教，而不是简单的部落宗教。考虑到世界文化和社会发展的演变过程，考虑到宗教和精神理解上的进步和演变，你可以看到这已经是一个很大的进步。宗教必须始终与它所要服务的种族的进化保持同步。它是否有能力做到这一点，将决定它有多大的益处，提供多大的服务。</p>
<p>You are now at a new threshold, an even greater threshold than your race faced over two millennia ago. Your emergence into the Greater Community will be the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity your race has ever experienced. This great threshold will be faced by everyone, not simply by one group, one nation or one culture. This has the possibility for genuinely uniting the world. This also has the possibility for separating the races of the world into a final self-destruction.</p>
<p>你们现在处于一个新的门槛，一个比你们的种族在两千多年前面临的更大的门槛。你们进入大社区将是你们种族有史以来经历的最大挑战和最大机会。这个巨大的门槛将由每个人面对，而不仅仅是一个群体、一个国家或一种文化。这有可能使世界真正地团结起来。这也有可能使世界上的种族分离，进入最后的自我毁灭。</p>
<p>To enable humanity to advance and to adapt to this greater set of circumstances in the Greater Community and to all the attending problems and opportunities that they will offer, religion must evolve. Though Jesus has established a foundation here, even Christianity must now evolve to meet a whole new set of circumstances.</p>
<p>为了使人类能够在大社区中进步并适应这些更广泛的环境以及所有随之而来的问题和机遇，宗教必须发展。尽管耶稣在这里奠定了基础，但即使是基督教现在也必须发展以应对全新的环境。</p>
<p>Resistance to Greater Community awareness in the world today is primarily centered in the world’s religions. These are religions for man. They are human religions with a human god and a human emphasis. They do not account for life in the Greater Community. Yet the reality of life in the Greater Community will challenge their precepts and will challenge the institutions that have been built upon these precepts. Therefore, it is likely in the years to come that the greatest resistance to the acceptance and realization of Greater Community life will come from the world’s religious leaders and the defenders of their respective faiths.</p>
<p>当今世界对大社区意识的抵制主要集中在世界的宗教中。这些都是人的宗教。它们是人类的宗教，有一个人类的上帝和一个人类的重点。它们并没有说明大社区的生命。然而，大社区的现实生命将挑战他们的戒律，并将挑战建立在这些戒律之上的机构。因此，在未来的岁月里，接受和实现大社区生命的最大阻力很可能来自世界上的宗教领袖和他们各自信仰的捍卫者。</p>
<p>However, religion must keep pace with the evolution of the world, and that is why The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is being presented into the world at this time. It has come at just the right time. It gives you a head start in preparation, but even with a head start, time is short because Greater Community forces are in the world today. Their influence over humanity and their impact on your environment are growing. You must be prepared not only to accept their presence, but to encounter them and to deal with their impact on you, both physically and mentally. This requires a new foundation for religious experience. The world’s religions will need this if they are to survive in the next era of human development and evolution.</p>
<p>然而，宗教必须跟上世界发展的步伐，这就是为什么大社区内识之路在这个时候被介绍给世界。它的出现恰逢其时。它给了你一个准备的先机，但即使有了先机，时间也很短，因为大社区的势力就在今天的世界上。他们对人类的影响和对你们的环境的影响正在增长。你必须做好准备，不仅要接受他们的存在，还要与他们相遇，并处理他们对你的影响，包括身体和心理上的影响。这需要一个新的宗教经历的基础。世界上的宗教要想在人类发展和进化的下一个时代生存下去，就需要这样做。</p>
<p>Religions have life spans. This is true throughout the Greater Community. Religions have life spans because they serve eras of development. Then they are either replaced or they change and expand in order to adapt. If they cannot adapt, they will be replaced because the reality of life will make their teaching and their emphasis less and less relevant and meaningful.</p>
<p>宗教是有寿命的。这在整个大社区都是如此。宗教有寿命限制，因为它们为发展的时代服务。然后它们要么被取代，要么为了适应而改变和扩展。如果它们不能适应，就会被取代，因为生活的现实会使它们的教义和重点越来越不相关，越来越没有意义。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, religions are initiated, they reach a maturity and then they enter old age where they die off. Out of their old age a new impetus, a new meaning and a new message can be given to restore and to renew the race’s spiritual vitality and to give this vitality an immediate relevancy to life as it is expanding and developing.</p>
<p>在大社区里，宗教被发起，它们达到成熟，然后进入老年，在那里它们会消亡。从它们的老龄化中可以获得新的动力、新的意义和新的讯息，以恢复和更新种族的精神活力，并使这种活力与正在扩展和发展的生命立即产生关联性。</p>
<p>Jesus set into motion a great era of development, an era that would serve and challenge people all around the world. His was not the only example, but he was a primary figure. Though he has been idolized and deified, though he has been condemned and scorned, and though he has been used by groups, organizations, tribes and governments for their own purposes, his example still remains—the recognition of one person by another across all boundaries of culture, race, economic position, language and orientation. His example provided a greater foundation for relationship, a greater foundation for recognition and a greater possibility for mutual development and achievement. This has been necessary for the development of international societies. This has also been necessary for the development and advancement of your race into a technological age.</p>
<p>耶稣开启了一个伟大的发展时代，这个时代将为全世界的人服务并对他们提出挑战。他不是唯一的例子，但他是一个主要人物。尽管他被偶像化和神化，尽管他被谴责和蔑视，尽管他被团体、组织、部落和政府用来达到自己的目的，但他的榜样仍然存在——一个人跨越文化、种族、经济地位、语言和取向的所有界限，得到另一个人的承认。他的例子为关系提供了更大的基础，为承认提供了更大的基础，为共同发展和成就提供了更大的可能性。这对于国际社会的发展是必要的。这也是你们种族发展和进入技术时代的必要条件。</p>
<p>Now you are at a new beginning. Now you have a greater challenge. Jesus knew that his time and place were crucial. He knew that he would have to play a very visible role in initiating a process that would extend far beyond his own life and awareness. He knew that the effect of his presence would cause violence, warfare and great tribulation, not only for his followers but for other generations of people to come. However, even he could not see at that time the full extent and impact of his contribution. He could not see how it would be used and how it would be misused and misappropriated in the years and centuries to come.</p>
<p>现在你们处于一个新的起点。现在你们有一个更大的挑战。耶稣知道他的时间和地点是至关重要的。他知道他将不得不在启动一个远远超出他自己的生命和意识的过程中扮演一个非常明显的角色。他知道他的存在的影响将导致暴力、战争和大灾难，不仅对他的追随者，而且对其他世代的人。然而，即使是他当时也无法看到他的贡献的全部范围和影响。他看不到它将如何被使用，以及在未来的岁月和世纪中它将如何被滥用和挪用。</p>
<p>However, he demonstrated a great truth—that a person’s purpose, however great or small, however visible or invisible to the eyes of others, must be in accordance with the needs and evolution of the world. Here religion serves whole eras of human development. This is understood from a Greater Community perspective, a perspective which you now have an opportunity to learn and to utilize.</p>
<p>然而，他证明了一个伟大的真理——一个人的目的，无论多么伟大或渺小，无论在别人眼中是可见还是不可见，都必须符合世界的需要和演变。在这里，宗教为人类发展的整个时代服务。这是从大社区的角度来理解的，这个角度你现在有机会学习和善用。</p>
<p>In the history of nations more advanced and longer established than yours, and in the experience of civilizations which have destroyed themselves through indulgence, manipulation or ignorance, it is evident everywhere as a universal principle that religions are born, they change and they die. In other words, they have a life. Their life extends far beyond the lives of the individuals who founded them, for their service is meant to be correlated to the greater evolution and development of the world in which they were introduced.</p>
<p>在比你们更先进、历史更悠久的国家的历史中，以及在那些因放纵、操纵或无知而自我毁灭的文明的经历中，作为一项普遍原则，宗教的诞生、变化和死亡是随处可见的。换句话说，它们是有生命的。它们的生命远远超出了创立它们的个人的生命，因为它们的服务是为了与它们被引入的世界的更大进化和发展相关联。</p>
<p>At this time in your world, certain religious traditions will die. Others will be renewed and reborn and given new emphasis and development. An old Christianity cannot meet a new set of circumstances. It must be a new Christianity, a Christianity that is renewing itself continuously—just as within the life and scope of a person’s experience, an old orientation cannot meet a new problem, an old belief cannot meet a new set of circumstances and an old identity cannot interact with a new identity. This is why humanity must be prepared for the Greater Community. This is why its religious traditions must evolve into this greater arena and participation in life. They must do this without a past reference, for the past is gone and life has changed.</p>
<p>在你们世界的这个时候，某些宗教传统将会消亡。其他宗教将被更新和重生，并得到新的强调和发展。一个旧的基督教不能满足一系列新的环境。它必须是一个新的基督教，一个不断自我更新的基督教——就像在一个人的生命和经历范围内，一个旧的方向不能满足一个新的问题，一个旧的信仰不能满足一套新的环境，一个旧的身份不能与一个新的身份互动。这就是为什么人类必须为大社区做好准备。这就是为什么它的宗教传统必须演进到这个更大的舞台和更大参与的生命中。他们必须在没有过去参照的情况下这样做，因为过去已经过去，生活已经改变。</p>
<p>Those principles that are universal and timeless must find new expression now. They cannot be held as the vestiges of antiquity. They must find a new expression because that which is permanent must find expression in changing circumstances. The expressions will change. The traditions of expression will change. And the emphasis of expression will change.</p>
<p>那些普遍且永恒的原则现在必须找到新的表达方式。它们不能被视为古老遗迹。它们必须找到新的表达方式，因为那些永久性的原则必须在变化的环境中找到表达方式。表达的形式会改变，表达的传统会改变，表达的重点也会改变。</p>
<p>What Jesus set into motion has universal application, but only in its purest sense. What has been made of his teaching will not be able to survive in a Greater Community context to any great degree. His emphasis on devotion, on forgiveness, on tolerance and on spiritual identity has permanent value. Here we must distinguish between the founder of a faith and the establishment of the religion that is built upon that faith.</p>
<p>耶稣所启动的具有普遍适用性，但只有在其最纯粹的意义上才能实现。他的教导所被塑造出的形式，在大社区的背景下无法在很大程度上生存下去。他对奉献、宽恕、宽容和精神身份的强调具有永久价值。在这里，我们必须区分信仰的创始人和建立在该信仰基础上的宗教。</p>
<p>Christianity is a religion for humanity with a human god and a human emphasis. It cannot account for life in the Greater Community. In order for this to happen, its theology will have to change and expand. Its idea of the Divine will have to change and expand. Its notion of God’s involvement in the world will have to grow enormously. Its teachings will have to be separated from the folklore of the past. Its theology and application will have to change and to adapt. If it cannot do this, it will die. No matter how virulent its defenders will be and no matter how strong its seeming resurgence, it will be overtaken by the reality of a changing world.</p>
<p>基督教是人类的宗教，有一个人类的上帝和一个人类的重点。它不能说明大社区的生命。为了做到这一点，它的神学必须改变和扩展。它对上帝的观念必须改变和扩大。它对上帝参与世界的概念将不得不大大增加。它的教导必须从过去的民间传说中分离出来。它的神学和应用将不得不改变和适应。如果它不能做到这一点，它就会死亡。不管它的捍卫者有多强烈，也不管它看起来有多强大的复苏，它都会被不断变化的世界的现实所超越。</p>
<p>In your own life, in order to meet life anew, you must have a new and open mind. Your mind must be renewing itself and refreshing itself. As you enter new stages of development as a person, what worked before at an earlier time may no longer be useful or applicable. You need new eyes to meet new experiences. You need a new faith, not an old faith. You need a new religious experience, not an old religious experience. You must look forward now and not backward.</p>
<p>在你自己的生命中，为了迎接新的生命，你必须有一个新的心灵和开放的心智。你的心智必须自我更新，自我刷新。当你作为一个人进入新的发展阶段时，以前在早期有效的经验可能不再有用或适用。你需要新的眼睛来迎接新的经历。你需要一个新的信仰，而不是一个旧的信仰。你需要一个新的宗教经历，而不是一个旧的宗教经历。你现在必须向前看，而不是向后看。</p>
<p>Many traditions and many long-standing associations and ideas will fall away given the enormity of human problems and the greater challenge that will be presented increasingly as humanity becomes aware of the Greater Community reality and its impact upon individual and national life here in the world.</p>
<p>鉴于人类问题的艰巨性和更大的挑战，许多传统和许多长期存在的协会和想法将逐渐消失，当人类意识到大社区的现实及其对世界上的个人和国家生活的影响时，这种挑战将日益呈现。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is not only a preparation for the Greater Community; it is a new foundation for religious understanding and experience. It is a foundation that will enable the world’s religions to advance into a new life with a new relevancy. And yet some of the world’s religions will not be able to advance, for they are already old and burdened and encrusted with the past. A Greater Community reality will be too much for them. Which religions will survive and which will not will be up to the people who participate within them. This will depend upon their ability to adapt and their ability to renew their faith and their experience. Yet the fundamental change will be profound.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路不仅是为大社区做准备；它是宗教理解和经历的新基础。它是一个基础，将使世界上的宗教进入一个新的生命，具有新的相关性。然而，世界上的一些宗教将无法前进，因为它们已经是老旧的、负担沉重的、被过去包裹着的。一个大社区的现实对他们来说将是难以承受的。哪些宗教能够生存，哪些不能，将取决于参与其中的人们。这将取决于他们的适应能力和更新他们的信仰和经历的能力。然而，根本的变化将是深刻的。</p>
<p>You must not exercise human arrogance regarding the Greater Community. If you believe that humanity is a blessed race and that the rest of the Greater Community is made up of barbarians who have not received God’s endowments, then you will be making a critical and fatal mistake. This will deny your ability to learn, to evolve, to adapt and to meet the greater challenges that lay ahead. Humanity is not a blessed race. It is not unique. It is not the centerpiece of creation. It is not God’s favorite child. God’s work is everywhere. All genuine religious traditions in the Greater Community are initiated through Knowledge and establish a means and a methodology for individuals to experience a greater purpose and meaning in life within the circumstances in which they live.</p>
<p>你不能对大社区行使人类的傲慢。如果你认为人类是一个受祝福的种族，而大社区的其他部分是由没有得到上帝恩赐的野蛮种族组成的，那么你将犯一个关键和致命的错误。这将否定你学习、进化、适应和迎接未来更大挑战的能力。人类不是一个受祝福的种族。它不是独一无二的。它不是创造的核心。它不是上帝最喜爱的孩子。上帝的工作无处不在。大社区中所有真正的宗教传统都是通过内识发起的，并为个体建立一种方式和方法，在他们生活的环境中经历更伟大的目的和生命的意义。</p>
<p>A theology of the universe is necessary now, not simply a theology of human psychology and human sociology. You need this to unify your race and to bridge the remaining gaps that exist between you so that you can find your common ground. The real common ground in life is Knowledge itself. In this, everyone has something fundamental that is in common. It is not tied to the past, and it is not governed by personal ambition, greed or enmity. It is time now for a Way of Knowledge, not for a way where there are heroes and heroines and idols of worship. This is not the time for fantastic stories or mythology. This is a time for real demonstration, real faith and real experience.</p>
<p>现在需要一种宇宙神学，而不仅仅是人类心理学和人类社会学的神学。你们需要这个来统一你们的种族，弥合你们之间存在的剩余差距，以便你们能够找到你们的共同点。生命中真正的共同点是内识本身。在这一点上，每个人都有一些基本的共同点。它不受过去的束缚，也不受个人野心、贪婪或敌意的支配。现在是走内识之路的时候了，而不是走有英雄和女英雄以及崇拜偶像的道路。现在不是讲神奇故事或神话的时候。这是一个真正展示、真正信仰和真正经历的时代。</p>
<p>Humanity is growing in its intellectual scope and understanding. Its religions have not kept pace with this by and large. You cannot have a religion of escape from the world now because the world is emerging into the Greater Community, and you have come to serve the world in its emergence and all that its emergence will mean and require. This is not a time to believe in heaven and hell. This is a time to come into the world to contribute and to participate. This is not a time to believe that God will judge and condemn and cast unbelievers into the infernal flames of hell. This is a time to realize that the challenge of development faces everyone. Those who can respond and who can prepare accordingly will be the great beneficiaries and the great contributors to their race, and they will experience a satisfaction that those who are unable to do this will not find no matter what their status or position in life.</p>
<p>人类在智力范围和理解力方面正在成长。它的宗教总的来说没有跟上这个步伐。你现在不能有一个逃避世界的宗教，因为世界正在兴起，进入大社区，而你的使命是服务于世界的这一转变，以及这一转变所带来的所有意义和要求。这不是一个相信天堂和地狱的时代，而是一个走进世界、贡献和参与的时代。这不是一个相信上帝会审判和谴责，并将不信者扔进地狱烈火的时代。这是一个意识到发展挑战摆在每个人面前的时代。那些能够回应并能相应准备的人，将成为其种族的伟大受益者和伟大贡献者，他们将经历到一种满足感，而那些无法做到这一点的人无论在生活中处于何种地位，都无法找到这种满足感。。</p>
<p>Where is Jesus today? Because of his great demonstration and because of the many misinterpretations of his demonstration and the tremendous idolization that has occurred regarding him, he is now an Unseen One in the world. He is an Unseen One not only in this world but in the worlds whose races humanity is destined to encounter. He will not reappear in the world. Though others will claim to represent him, he will not reappear, for his mission is done in this regard. His work now is with the Unseen Ones.</p>
<p>耶稣今天在哪里？由于他的伟大示范，以及对他示范的许多误解和对他的巨大崇拜，他现在是世界上的不可见者。他不仅在这个世界上是一位不可见者，在人类注定要遇到的其他种族的世界中也是如此。他不会再出现在这个世界上。虽然其他人会声称代表他，但他不会再出现，因为他在这方面的任务已经完成。他现在的工作是与不可见者一起。</p>
<p>Here you must expand your ideas considerably, for there are many Unseen Ones in the universe. There is not one who is paramount amongst them. For when you graduate from this life, you are a beginner in the next stage of life. You do not simply return to heaven to spend eternity in repose. You enter another stage of service and activity, learning and preparation.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须大大扩展你的想法，因为宇宙中有许多不可见者。在他们中没有一个是最重要的。因为当你从今生毕业时，你是下一阶段生命的初学者。你并不是简单地回到天国，在安息中度过永恒。你进入另一个服务和活动的阶段，学习和准备。</p>
<p>Jesus is in the world. Take comfort. However, he will not come again in the flesh. Who will come again in the flesh claiming his name will be someone from the Greater Community. Beware. If you can become strong with Knowledge, you will know and will not be deceived. Yet, if you fervently want to believe and are governed by the weakness of belief, then you can be persuaded. A Greater Community presence can perform seeming miracles for you. They can do things that seem magical and inexplicable, and many people will fall down in belief and adoration because of this. The world is not yet prepared for the Greater Community. And there is not enough discernment amongst your people to distinguish Greater Community demonstrations from the reality of God’s demonstration.</p>
<p>耶稣就在这个世界上。请安心。然而，他不会以基督再来。谁会在基督再来中出现，声称他的的名字，将是大社区的个体。请注意。如果你能成为内识的强者，你就会知道，就不会被欺骗。然而，如果你热切地想要相信并被信仰的弱点所支配，那么你就会被说服。一个大社区的存在可以为你创造看似奇迹的事情。他们可以做一些看起来很神奇、无法解释的事情，很多人都会因此在信仰和崇拜中倒下。这个世界还没有为大社区做好准备。而且你们的人中没有足够的辨别力来区分大社区的示范和上帝的现实示范。</p>
<p>Jesus is in the world reinforcing Knowledge. Jesus is in other worlds as well, for your destiny lies in your interaction with other worlds now. The possibility for success here must be reinforced by the Unseen Ones, who speak to those who can respond with Knowledge. This is possible because The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is being taught here and elsewhere, as we have said.</p>
<p>耶稣在这个世界上加强内识。耶稣也在其他世界，因为你们的命运就在于你们现在与其他世界的互动。在这里成功的可能性必须由不可见者加强，他们对那些能用内识回应的人说话。这是可能的，因为正如我们所说的，大社区内识之路正在这里和其他地方被教授。</p>
<p>Jesus is revered amongst your people because of his example and demonstration, but even more than this, he set into motion a process of spiritual initiation, growth and development that continues to this day and which has promise for the future. The theology that has been built upon his demonstration, however, cannot survive. His demonstration will survive because it is the demonstration of Knowledge, and it calls upon Knowledge in those who can bear witness to it. This is not faith in a set of beliefs, faith in a set of traditions or faith in a church hierarchy. This is faith in the direct transmission of Knowledge from one mind to another. In this, Jesus has great potency, and that is why he is still in the world.</p>
<p>耶稣在你们的人民中受到尊敬，因为他的榜样和示范，但更重要的是，他启动了一个精神上的启蒙、成长和发展的过程，这个过程一直持续到今天，并且对未来充满希望。然而，建立在他的示范之上的神学是无法生存的。他的示范会存活下来，因为它是内识的示范，它要求那些能为它作证的人有内识。这不是对一套信仰的信仰，对一套传统的信仰，或对一个教会等级制度的信仰。这是对内识从一个人的心灵直接传递给另一个人的信仰。在这一点上，耶稣具有巨大的效力，这就是为什么他仍然在这个世界上。</p>
<p>You are entering a new era now. It is not the era of international civilizations. It is an era requiring a united world civilization. This is a far greater challenge and one that will take a great deal of time and probably much struggle to accomplish. What will give it necessity and impetus is the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. No matter how much you may distrust your neighbor, no matter how much you may feel you are better than others, no matter how superior you may feel your culture’s values, customs and ethics are over another’s—this will all be equalized and minimized by the overshadowing of the Greater Community presence in the world.</p>
<p>你们现在正在进入一个新的时代。这不是国际文明的时代。这是一个需要统一的世界文明的时代。这是一个更大的挑战，将需要大量的时间和可能的斗争来完成。赋予它必要性和推动力的是世界在大社区中的出现。无论你有多不信任你的邻居，无论你有多觉得自己比别人强，无论你有多觉得自己的文化价值、习俗和道德比别人的优越，这些都会因为大社区在世界的存在而被平等化和最小化。</p>
<p>This represents the possibility for redemption that the Greater Community offers you. It requires change. It requires cooperation. It requires acceptance. It requires setting aside old disputes and squabbles. It requires that you adopt a world identity, not just a national identity. It requires a greater association amongst people and a greater respect and tolerance. These are required because the world is emerging into the Greater Community. Jesus will be part of this emergence, but he must watch the great changes that are occurring in life. And he must give his counsel without interfering now. For he made his presentation, and now he has a greater and loftier service to perform.</p>
<p>这代表了大社区为你提供的救赎的可能性。它需要改变。它需要合作。它需要接受。它需要搁置旧的争端和争吵。它要求你采用世界身份，而不仅仅是国家身份。它要求人们之间有更大的联合，有更大的尊重和宽容。这些都是需要的，因为世界正在向大社区涌现。耶稣将成为这一崛起的一部分，但他必须观察生命中正在发生的巨大变化。而且他现在必须在不干预的情况下给出他的建议。因为他已经做了介绍，现在他有一个更大更高的服务要做。</p>
<p>The emphasis must now be on Knowledge because this is the essence of your spirituality, and this will give you a new direction in life. The emphasis must no longer be on beliefs, ideas, principles, images and creation stories. If you can move with life, life will move you. If you can keep pace with life, your spirituality will have a new vitality and possibility for expression.</p>
<p>现在的重点必须是内识，因为这是你们精神性的实质，这将给你带来新的生命方向。重点必须不再是信仰、观念、原则、形象和创世故事。如果你能与生命一起移动，生命就会推动你。如果你能与生命同步，你的精神性就会有新的活力和表达的可能性。</p>
<p>Then you will understand Jesus—not only because you can appreciate his past demonstration and the beneficence that he encouraged and has engendered in the world. You will understand that he came into life at a unique time to render a unique service. His life was exceptional because he did not remain hidden. And he paid the price for not remaining hidden. However, his demonstration had to be very visible so that it would be remembered. Though much fantasy has been woven around his life, and though his life has been manipulated and used according to secular interests all around the world, his demonstration of compassion, tolerance and shared identity persists to this day and has great bearing for the future.</p>
<p>然后你就会理解耶稣——不仅仅是因为你能欣赏他过去的示范，以及他鼓励并在世界范围内产生的善意。你会明白，他在一个独特的时间进入生命，提供独特的服务。他的生命是特殊的，因为他没有继续隐藏。他也为不隐藏而付出了代价。然而，他的示范必须是非常明显的，这样才会被人记住。尽管围绕他的生命编织了许多幻想，尽管他的生命被世界各地的世俗利益所操纵和利用，但他对同情、宽容和共同身份的展示一直持续到今天，对未来有很大的影响。</p>
<p>Here you must distinguish between religion and spirituality. The purpose of religion is to enable spirituality to be experienced, to be applied and to be fully utilized. When religion ceases to be able to do this and becomes an entity in and of itself, then it begins to usurp its essential and primary purpose. Here it must be changed. And change it will.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须区分宗教和精神性。宗教的目的是使精神性能够被经历，被应用，被充分善用。当宗教无法再做到这一点并成为一个独立存在时，它就开始篡夺其根本和主要的目的。在这里，它必须被改变，并且它将被改变。</p>
<p>You may think of Jesus as either a man with a Divine purpose or as a Divine being with a human purpose. However you might think of Jesus, you think of him within the context of your world and within the context of human involvements and interaction. We are now challenging you to think of him as a figure in the Greater Community. He is not an extraterrestrial from outer space. He was a man who realized Knowledge and contributed Knowledge in his time and helped to set into motion, through the efforts of many other people, a greater emphasis in life and a means for re-experiencing this emphasis through a tradition of devotion, dedication and service.</p>
<p>你可以将耶稣看作是一个具有神圣使命的人，或是一个具有凡人使命的神圣存在。然而，无论你如何看待耶稣，你都是在你的世界背景下，以及在人类的参与和互动背景下看待他的。我们现在挑战你以大社区的视角来看待他。他不是一个来自外太空的外星人。他是一个在他的时代实现内识并贡献内识的人，并通过许多其他人的努力，推动了一种更高的生命重心，并通过奉献、献身和服务的传统，再次体验这一重心的途径。</p>
<p>Now you must think of him as an Unseen One in the Greater Community. Here you have the challenge of broadening your understanding, opening your mind and setting aside those ideas, concepts, beliefs and preferences which cannot fit into a greater reality. For Jesus to be real for you now and to be real in the future, you must have this approach. His reality and his role are consistent with everything we have said, but for you to keep pace with this, you must develop in The Way of Knowledge. You must find the foundation that will carry your spirituality into the future and give it eminent presence and ability there. Otherwise, Jesus will be a historical figure that will seem increasingly removed from life. You will identify him with an earlier time and with a passing age. And he will seem to be lost with everything that was associated with him, which will fade from view over the decades and centuries to come.</p>
<p>现在，你必须把他看作是大社区中的一位不可见者。在这里，你面临的挑战是拓宽你的理解，打开你的心智，把那些不能适应更大现实的想法、概念、信仰和偏好放在一边。为了使耶稣现在对你来说是真实的，并且在未来也是真实的，你必须有这种方法。他的现实和他的角色与我们所说的一切是一致的，但为了让你跟上这个步伐，你必须在内识之路中发展。你必须找到能将你的精神性带入未来的基础，并在未来赋予它卓越的存在和能力。否则，耶稣将成为一个历史人物，似乎与生命越来越远。你将把他与一个更早的时代和一个逝去的时代联系起来。而耶稣似乎将与与他相关的一切一起消失，在未来的几十年和几个世纪里，这些都将从人们的视野中消失。</p>
<p>Look forward. Look over the horizon. See what is coming. What is past is past and was relevant to the past. In order for spirituality and for religion to have meaning, purpose and value now and in the future, they must be renewed and be able to respond to the greater movement of the world and to the changing needs of humanity.</p>
<p>向前看。眺望地平线。看到即将到来的变革。过去的已经过去，与过去相关。为了使精神性和宗教在现在和未来都具有意义、目的和价值，它们必须得到更新，能够对世界的更大运动和人类不断变化的需求作出回应。</p>
<p>Religion is like a prescription for you to see. You outgrow old prescriptions, and then you have to have your eyes re-examined. You get a new prescription which enables you to see clearly in the present. The old prescription is no longer able to do that. Think of religion in this way. Think of it as an intermediary. Think of it as a changeable structure. Think of it as a prescription for seeing, knowing and acting—honestly, truthfully and beneficially. Here you will not become attached to the form but will bond with the essence. And the essence will transcend the form, rejuvenate the form and renew it. It will give form new meaning and relevancy in your life and within the world which you have come to serve.</p>
<p>宗教就像一个处方，让你看见。你超越了旧的处方，然后你必须重新检查你的眼睛。你得到一个新的处方，使你能够清晰地看到现在的情况。旧的处方不再能够做到这一点。以这种方式思考宗教。把它想成是一个中介。把它看作是一个可改变的结构。把它看作是一个看见、知道和行动的处方——诚实、真实和有益。在这里，你不会依附于形式，而会与实质结合。而实质将超越形式，使形式重新焕发活力，更新它。它将在你的生命和你所服务的世界中赋予形式新的意义和相关性。</p>
<p>Your idea of Jesus must be seen in a greater context. Your idea of God must be seen in a greater context. This must be a Jesus of the Greater Community. This must be a God of the Greater Community. And there must be a spirituality of the Greater Community and a theology of the Greater Community. Do not be concerned that you may seem to be the only one thinking these things, for you are pioneering. Pioneers must go where others are not willing to go, must realize what others cannot or will not realize and must share what others cannot or will not share.</p>
<p>你对耶稣的想法必须在更大的背景下被看到。你对上帝的想法必须在一个更大的背景下被看到。这必须是一个大社区的耶稣。这必须是一个大社区的上帝。而且必须有一个大社区的精神性和大社区的神学。不要担心你似乎是唯一在想这些事情的人，因为你是先锋。先驱者必须去别人不愿意去的地方，必须实现别人不能或不愿实现的工作，必须分享别人不能或不愿分享的内识。</p>
<p>This is your challenge, and this is your great opportunity for contribution. Meet this reality and this challenge, and you will come to know Jesus because you will be facing what he faced, yet in a much smaller way, perhaps. You will know Jesus because you will share his experience. If you can do this, you will know that he is in the world today and that he will play a beneficial part in the world’s emergence into the Greater Community.</p>
<p>这就是你的挑战，也是你做出贡献的巨大机会。迎接这一现实和挑战，你就会知道耶稣，因为你将面临他所面临的，但可能是以更小的方式。你将知道耶稣，因为你将分享他的经历。如果你能做到这一点，你就会知道，他今天就在这个世界上，他将在这个世界进入大社区的过程中发挥有益的作用。</p>
