<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on October 21, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年10月21日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question is clear, but it may take a very long time to understand what it means and what it will require of you. Wisdom is meant for you—you who have been drawn to a greater experience of purpose, meaning and direction in life, you who have not been able to be content with the little satisfactions that preoccupy most people. It is meant for you who feel a deeper yearning for truth and who entertain a vague but persistent feeling that there is something important for you to do in life—something that is unique and significant, something that you have not been able to find at your universities, in your books or through your conversations, something extraordinary, something that most people are not even aware of. It is meant for you who have felt this inner need and this inner prompting that have set you apart from others and that have made you impatient with the superficial things of life. It is for you who feel an affinity with all life and who have a sense that your life and your purpose extend far beyond the immediate circumstances of your individual existence here. It is meant for you who feel and long for a deeper affinity with another, who seek relationships that are meaningful and permanent, relationships that have a greater context and a greater capacity for self-expression and for shared affinity.</p>
<p>这个问题的答案很清楚，但可能需要很长的时间来理解它的含义和它对你的要求。智慧是为你而设的——你被吸引到对生命目的、意义和方向的更伟大经历，你无法满足于大多数人所关注的小满足。它是为那些对真理有更深的渴望的人准备的，他们有一种模糊但持续的感觉，即在生命中有一些重要的事情需要你去做——一些独特而有意义的事情，一些你在大学、书本或谈话中无法找到的事情，一些非同寻常的事情，一些大多数人甚至没有意识到的事情。它是为那些感受到这种内在需求和内在提示的人准备的，这些需求和提示使你与他人不同，使你对生活中的肤浅事物不耐烦。它是为那些感觉到与所有生命有亲和力，并且感觉到你的生命和你的目的远远超出了你在这里的个人存在的直接环境的人准备的。它是为那些感到并渴望与他人有更深的亲和力的人准备的，他们寻求有意义的和持久的关系，有更大的背景，有更大的自我表达能力和共同的亲和力的关系。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is meant for you. It is meant for you who are reading these words, you who have shown a spark of interest, you who have already taken some initial steps towards something great and mysterious in your life. Wisdom is meant for you who have already tasted its beneficence, its grandeur, its grace and its simplicity—an experience that sets it in contrast to all other things in life, making them dull and mundane in comparison, an experience of certainty, open-mindedness and greater relationship with life. And even though the experience of Wisdom might have only lasted for a moment, it still abides with you now as a tiny but significant reminder that you have come from a greater life and that you will return to a greater life. It is a reminder that you are here to do something important and that you must meet certain people in order to accomplish your task. The inner prompting towards this continues even now and has brought you to open the book that reveals a greater Wisdom and purpose in your life.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路是为你准备的。它是为正在阅读这些文字的你准备的，是为已经表现出兴趣火花的你准备的，是为已经向生命中伟大而神秘的内识迈出最初几步的你准备的。智慧是为那些已经尝到它的好处、它的宏伟、它的优雅和它的简单的人准备的——这种经历使它与生命中所有其他事物形成对比，使它们相比之下变得枯燥和平凡，这是一种确定性的经验，开放的心态和与生命的更大关系。即使智慧的经历可能只持续了一瞬间，但它现在仍然与你同在，作为一个微小但重要的提醒，你来自一个更伟大的生命，你将回到一个更伟大的生命。它提醒你，你在这里要做一件重要的事，而且你必须见到某些人，以完成你的任务。对这一点的内在提示甚至现在还在继续，并使你打开了这本书，揭示了你生命中更伟大的智慧和目的。</p>
<p>You may ask, “Is this meant for everyone?” The answer to this is no, for not everyone can receive it. If everyone could receive it, the answer would be yes. Why should something be meant for someone who will not, within this life, gain access to it? Remember, we have said that God does what works. Greater things are revealed to those who experience a greater need and who have already set in motion a process of moving towards Knowledge by becoming honest about their affairs, about their feelings and about their deeper inclinations. If this has not already happened for a person, then he or she may not even be able to begin the reclamation of Knowledge or the study of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. This is not to say that those people who have had these preliminary experiences have made great progress, but it does mean that they have already begun a process that can enable them to experience truth, to recognize its value and to set it in contrast to all other things that compete with it.</p>
<p>你可能会问，”这是为所有人准备的吗？”这个问题的答案是否定的，因为不是每个人都能接受它。如果每个人都能接受它，答案将是肯定的。为什么内识要给那些这辈子都无法得到它的人呢？请记住，我们已经说过，上帝做的是有效的事情。更大的目的会展现给那些经历过更大需求的人，他们已经启动了一个走向内识的过程，对他们的事务、他们的感觉和他们更深的倾向变得诚实。如果一个人还没有做到这一点，那么他或她甚至可能无法开始内识的开垦或对大社区内识之路的研究。这并不是说那些有了这些初步经历的人已经取得了巨大的进步，但这确实意味着他们已经开始了一个过程，可以使他们体验到真理，认识到它的价值，并将它与所有其他与之竞争的关系进行对比。</p>
<p>The experience of truth—the experience of being united with yourself, being honest with yourself and having integrity within yourself—however limited and circumstantial it may be, is an outstanding experience. This experience is established in contrast to all of the compromises, the avoidance, the compulsions and the fearful activities that govern the minds of so many in the world today.</p>
<p>真理的经历——与自己结合的经历，对自己诚实的经历，在自己内心有诚信的经历——无论它是多么的有限和偶然，都是一种杰出的经历。这种经历是与所有的妥协、回避、强迫和恐惧的活动形成对比的，这些活动支配着当今世界上许多人的心灵。</p>
<p>Wisdom is meant for you because you have arrived at these words. This is not to say that your success is guaranteed. This is not to assure you that everything will work out perfectly. This is not to reward you for great accomplishments. It is only to acknowledge a beginning and a real potential. If you value the words that you have read so far in this book, then you have already arrived at the beginning of a new perspective.</p>
<p>智慧是为你准备的，因为你已经来到了这些话语。这并不是说你的成功是有保证的。这不是为了向你保证一切都会完美地进行。这不是为了奖励你的伟大成就。它只是承认一个开始和一个真正的潜力。如果你重视你在本书中迄今所读到的文字，那么你已经到达了一个新视角的起点。</p>
<p>The experience of truth and reality is in such contrast to all other experiences that you will come back to it again and again. Perhaps you are afraid of this experience; perhaps you think it will rob you of your pleasures and your interests. However, in spite of these fears, which are unfounded, you will return to the experience of truth because you will be able to experience reality here. As you experience reality, you will see how empty and unfulfilling all other pursuits are. You will see how, after great expense and involvement, they produce such small rewards. The price of these pursuits is so high, and the rewards are so small. Escaping the experience of being cheated by life and the experience of cheating life itself represent a great freedom and a great opportunity.</p>
<p>真理和现实的经历与所有其他经历形成了鲜明的对比，你会一次又一次地回到它身边。也许你害怕这种经历；也许你认为它会剥夺你的快乐和兴趣。然而，尽管这些恐惧是毫无根据的，你还是会回到真理的经历中去，因为你将能够在这里经历现实。当你经历现实时，你将看到所有其他的追求是多么空虚和不满足。你会看到，在付出巨大的代价和参与之后，它们产生的回报是如此之小。这些追求的代价是如此之高，而回报是如此之小。摆脱被生活欺骗的经历和欺骗生命本身的经历，代表了一种巨大的自由和巨大的机会。</p>
<p>Wisdom is meant for you. A great journey lies ahead for you—a journey that will be challenging and remarkable, a journey that will affirm your deeper nature, a journey that will free you from the bondage of your own ideas and obligations to others, a journey that will take you beyond dependency into a truly independent state and beyond this into a state where you can become interdependent with others. It is in this stage of interdependence that real relationships are established and true devotion can arise. If you truly want what you know, then you will know what you want. However, if you only want what you think, you will enter deeper and deeper into confusion and will invest yourself ever more heavily in those things that can only confuse and frustrate you.</p>
<p>智慧是为你准备的。一段伟大的旅程摆在你面前——一个充满挑战和非凡的旅程，一个肯定你更深层本性的旅程，一个将你从你自己的想法和对他人的义务的束缚中解放出来的旅程，一个将你超越依赖性进入真正独立状态的旅程，以及超越这个状态进入你可以与他人相互依存的状态。正是在这个相互依存的阶段，真正的关系得以建立，真实的奉献得以产生。如果你真正想要你所知道的，那么你就会知道你想要什么。然而，如果你只想要你所想的，你就会在困惑中越陷越深，并且会在那些只能使你困惑和沮丧的关系中投入更多的精力。</p>
<p>Wisdom is meant for you because it is an answer to your prayers. The opportunity to gain access to Knowledge, to learn Greater Community Spirituality and to develop Wisdom is the answer to your deepest needs. Move towards this and your lesser needs will become resolved in the process. Then you will not have to devote so much time and energy to their resolution. Tell the truth about something great and you can tell the truth about everything around it. The truth grows in this way because it stands in contrast to everything else. Experience your own reality as the result of being honest with yourself and others and you will never want to lose this experience. You will return to it again and again, even in situations where there is great challenge or risk of loss.</p>
<p>智慧是为你准备的，因为它是对你祈祷的回应。获得内识、学习大社区精神性和发展智慧的机会是对你最深层需求的回应。朝着这个方向前进，你较小的需求就会在这个过程中得到解决。然后你就不必为解决这些需求而投入那么多的时间和能量。说出一些伟大内识的真理，你就能说出它周围一切关系的真理。真理以这种方式成长，因为它与其他一切形成对比。经历你自己的现实，作为对自己和他人诚实的结果，你将永远不想失去这种经历。你会一次又一次地回到它身边，甚至在有巨大挑战或损失风险的情况下。</p>
<p>Wisdom is meant for you who can understand these words and respond to them. You must be the first recipient. Do not think of your friend or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father whom you would like to restore or change in some way to make them easier for you to be with. Wisdom is not for them; it is for you. Everything we say is about you and for you. Do not look over your shoulder. Do not point across the street. Do not think of someone else who is having difficulty in their life right now and think, “Oh, this would be so good for them.” No, this is for you. They may not be ready for this. They may not be interested. This may not be their way. They may not even have a way for a very long time.</p>
<p>智慧是为能够理解这些话并对其作出回应的你而准备的。你必须是第一个接收者。不要想到你的朋友、兄弟、姐妹、母亲或父亲，你想以某种方式恢复或改变他们，使他们更容易与你相处。智慧不是为了他们；而是为了你。我们说的每件事都是关于你的，也是为了你。不要看向你的肩膀。不要指着对面的街道。不要想到其他人，他们现在生活有困难，并认为，”哦，这对他们有好处”。不，这是给你的。他们可能还没有准备好接受这个。他们可能不感兴趣。这可能不是他们的方式。他们甚至可能在很长时间内都没有办法。</p>
<p>In our presentation to you, we present things that are both within the range of your experience and beyond it. Because something is beyond the range of your experience does not mean that it is not important or relevant to your needs and to your future. It simply means that it is not related to your past. We want to take you into the future and prepare you for the future. The preparation will speak of things you know already and of things you have never thought of. If you say, “Well, I cannot relate to some of these ideas,” what you are saying is that they do not relate to your past and past interpretation. Of course not! They do not relate to your past because they are here to liberate you from your past. If you took everything we said and you said, “Oh, I know this. I know this. I know this,” you would be using everything we say to reinforce your past. Our mission is to free you from the past so that you can live in the present and prepare for the future, which will enable you to live in the future.</p>
<p>在我们对你的介绍中，我们介绍的内识既在你的经验范围之内，又在你的经验之外。因为内识超出了你的经验范围，并不意味着它对你的需求和你的未来不重要或不相关。它只是意味着它与你的过去没有关系。我们想带你进入未来，为你的未来做准备。准备工作将谈到你已经知道的事情和你从未想过的事情。如果你说，”好吧，我无法与其中一些想法联系起来，”你所说的是，它们与你的过去和过去的解释没有关系。当然不是！它们与你的过去无关。它们与你的过去没有关系，因为它们在这里是为了把你从你的过去解放出来。如果你把我们说的一切都听进去了，你说：”哦，我知道这个。我知道这个。我知道这个，”你会用我们说的一切来强化你的过去。我们的任务是把你从过去中解放出来，以便你能生活在当下，为未来做准备，从而使你能够生活在未来。</p>
<p>This is meant for you. Receive this. Learn to become a receiver. You are not ready to teach this to others yet, for you must be engaged in studying Steps to Knowledge and advanced as a student of Knowledge in order to translate and transfer this to others successfully. You know, many people want to go out and share everything they learn as soon as they learn it. The problem is that they have not really learned it, and so they cannot demonstrate it. If you want to inspire others, if you want to show them something that has really been effective in your life, then you yourself must demonstrate it. This demonstration is far more powerful and effective than any words that you could say or any illustrations that you could create. That is why we say that this is for you. The gift is for you. It is not for anyone else. It is for you.</p>
<p>这是为你准备的。接收这个。学习成为一名接收者。你还没有准备好把这个教给其他人，因为你必须从事研究内识的阶梯，并作为内识的学生进阶，以便成功地翻译和转换给他人。你知道，很多人一学就想出去分享他们学到的一切。问题是他们并没有真正学会，所以他们无法示范。如果你想激励他人，如果你想向他们展示在你的生命中真正有效的内识，那么你自己必须示范。这种示范远比你能说的任何话或你能创造的任何插图更有力、更有效。这就是为什么我们说这是给你的。这个礼物是给你的。它不是给其他人的。它是给你的。</p>
<p>Why would you read about Greater Community Spirituality if you were dedicated to reinforcing your former beliefs and ideas? Regardless of your former beliefs and ideas, the teaching and the preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge will take you beyond them. Then you will not be encumbered by them, and you will be free to live in the present and to see things as they really are, not as you want them to be or believe them to be.</p>
<p>如果你致力于加强你以前的信仰和想法，你为什么要阅读大社区精神性？不管你以前的信仰和想法如何，大社区内识之路中的教学和准备工作将使你超越它们。这样你就不会被它们所束缚，你就可以自由地活在当下，看到事物的真实面目，而不是你想看到的或相信的那样。</p>
<p>Some people think that you only see what you believe. They think that if you change your ideas, you will see something else. This ignores the reality that there is life outside of you. Life is happening. It is not all about you. It is not the result of your own thinking. You interpret what you see, but this only means that you are either able to see what is in front of you as it is or you are not. We are teaching you to see, to see things simply, as they really are—without self-glorification, without self-avoidance, without self-protection and without falsification of any kind. See yourself as you are today. See others as they are today. See the world as it is today. All without condemnation. To see without condemnation, you must see without idealism. You must see without the need for you, for others and for the world to be as you want them to be. Insisting on these things leads you to condemnation because the world, others and you yourself will disappoint you. They will not live up to your expectations. To see things as they really are, you must let them be as they really are, without attempting to put happy faces on them or sad faces, without attempting to make them beautiful or hideous. This can be done.</p>
<p>有些人认为，你只能看见自己所相信的生命。他们认为，如果你改变自己的想法，你就会看见另一种生命。这就忽略了一个现实，即在你之外还有生命。生命正在发生。它不全是关于你的。它不是你自己思考的结果。你解释你所看到的，但这仅仅意味着你要么能够看见眼前生命的本来样子，要么不能。我们在教你如何看清生命，以简单的方式，看见生命真实的样子——没有自我美化，没有自我回避，没有自我保护，也没有任何形式的歪曲。看清今天的自己。看清今天的他人。看清今天的世界。所有这些都没有谴责。要没有谴责地看，你必须没有理想主义地看。你必须看到你、他人和世界不需要像你希望的那样。如果坚持这些理想主义，你就会走向谴责，因为世界、他人和你自己都会让你失望。它们不会达到你的期望。要看见生命真实的样子，你必须让生命真实地存在，不试图给它们加上开心的面具或悲伤的面具，不试图让它们变得美丽或丑陋。这是可以做到的。</p>
<p>To bring you back into relationship with yourself, with others and with the world, you need this kind of vision. This vision will be the by-product of the reclamation of Knowledge within you. Knowledge deals with things only as they really are and leads them towards their purpose and fulfillment without any deception, glorification or condemnation. This experience is possible for you because Wisdom is meant for you.</p>
<p>为了使你回到与你自己、与他人和与世界的关系中，你需要这种远见。这种视野将是在你内在开垦内识的副产品。内识只处理关系的真实情况，并引导它们走向它们的目的和实现，没有任何欺骗、美化或谴责。这种经历对你来说是可能的，因为智慧是为你准备的。</p>
<p>You may ask, “Why isn’t this meant for everyone?” The answer is simple but again hard to understand. Potentially, truth is for everyone, but today it is meant for those who can receive it today, and tomorrow it will be meant for those who can receive it tomorrow. Perhaps you cannot receive the truth today. Then you come back tomorrow, and you can receive it. The Way of Knowledge is the return to truth and the reclamation of all meaningful relationships. It is offered to everyone, but few will respond, so it seems like it is offered to them specifically, which is not the case.</p>
<p>你可能会问，”为什么这不是为所有人准备的呢？”答案很简单，但又很难理解。潜在地，真理是为每个人准备的，但今天它是为那些今天能接受它的人准备的，而明天它将是为那些明天能接受它的人准备的。也许你今天不能接受真理。那么你明天再来，你就能接受它。内识之路是对真理的回归，是对所有有意义的关系的开垦。它被提供给每个人，但很少有人会回应，所以它似乎是专门提供给少数人的，但事实并非如此。</p>
<p>We make everything practical, plain and simple. Therefore, we must emphasize that this is meant for you. You must learn to receive the gifts. Perhaps they are not like the gifts that you have thought of or have sought after or have invested yourself in—those things that have only required you to give more and have put you deeper in debt within yourself. We offer a different kind of gift, a different way of living—a way that calls upon your ability and requires its expression. We do not only give you ideas, for ideas alone are not enough. What we give is a message that calls you out of your dilemma and provides a means of escape from those things that could only belittle you, confuse you and isolate you. We give this because Wisdom is meant for you.</p>
<p>我们使一切变得实际、明了和简单。因此，我们必须强调，这一切都是为你准备的。你必须学会接收这些礼物。也许这些礼物不像你曾经想过的、追求的或投入其中的那些关系——那些只要求你付出更多，并使你在自己的内心深处负债。我们提供的是一种不同类型的礼物，一种不同的生活方式——一种呼唤你的能力并需要你表达出来的方式。我们不仅仅给你想法，因为仅有想法是不够的。我们所提供的是一种讯息，它呼唤你走出困境，提供一种逃离那些只能贬低你、困惑你并孤立你的事物的途径。我们这样做是因为智慧是为你而准备的。</p>
<p>If you can receive Wisdom and learn The Way of Knowledge, then you will be able to give to others. Then certain people will be able to receive from you. In this way, a greater meaning, purpose and direction in life can be given to everyone, moving through the channels of relationships as they exist throughout your world and throughout the Greater Community.</p>
<p>如果你能接受智慧，学习内识之路，那么你将能给予他人。然后某些人将能够从你那里接收。通过这种方式，生命中更大的意义、目的和方向可以被赋予给每个人，通过关系的渠道移动，因为它们存在于整个你的世界和整个大社区。</p>
<p>If you can receive the gift, you will demonstrate that you have received it. It will work within you, and it will find an expression through you according to your nature and your design. It will bless you and empower you and give you depth of insight and understanding. It will give you patience and forbearance. It will teach you that you live a greater life. Through this long and wonderful process of development, you will give to others—others you can see and others you cannot see. Your life will become more and more a demonstration, and your ideas will have more potency because they will ring true. These are not temporary ideas; they are permanent ideas. They are lasting. They are meaningful.</p>
<p>如果你能收到这个礼物，你将证明你已经接受了它。它将在你体内发挥作用，它将根据你的本性和设计通过你找到表达方式。它将祝福你，赋予你力量，使你有深刻的洞察力和理解力。它将给你耐心和忍耐。它将教导你，你活得更伟大。通过这个漫长而奇妙的发展过程，你将为他人付出——你能看到的他人和你看不到的其他人。你的生命将越来越成为一种示范，你的想法将有更多的效力，因为它们将响起真实的声音。这些不是暂时的想法；它们是永久的想法。它们是持久的。它们是有意义的。</p>
<p>The path is not difficult so much as it is exacting. Like following a footpath through a dense jungle, you must watch your steps carefully and be very attentive to your environment as it changes. You cannot go running ahead, proclaiming yourself or your ideas, trying to improve people or situations. You must follow the way carefully and slowly. In this way, the dangers of the jungle will not affect you. In this way, you will foresee danger and difficulty and will find a way to avoid them or to change them if that is possible.</p>
<p>这条路并不困难，而是很严格。就像在茂密的丛林中沿着脚下的路走，你必须小心翼翼地看着你的脚步，并在环境变化时非常注意。你不能跑到前面去，宣扬你自己或你的想法，试图改善人们或情况。你必须小心翼翼地、慢慢地跟着路走。这样，丛林中的危险就不会影响你。这样，你会预见到危险和困难，并会找到一种方法来避免它们或改变它们，如果有可能的话。</p>
<p>If you can receive, you can give. Until you have received and learned The Way of Knowledge, you cannot give it because it is not you who will do the giving. It is Knowledge itself that will do the giving. This is the great difference, and it will make all the difference in your experience and in your expression of truth.</p>
<p>如果你可以收到，你就能给予。在你收到和学习内识之路之前，你不能给予它，因为不是你在给予。是内识本身要做给予。这就是巨大的区别，它将在你的经验和你对真理的表达中带来所有的不同。</p>
<p>How is Knowledge transferred from one to another? It is ignited invisibly. We speak to Knowledge within you, not to your mind. If you are connected to Knowledge and can experience it, you will feel the depth and impact of what we are saying. This is how Knowledge is transferred. This is how Knowledge is ignited. This is how true initiation takes place. There are outer things to do, of course, and they require much time and energy. However, the Mystery—the transference of Knowledge and the reuniting of ancient bonds—is something that is beyond the intellectual understanding of anyone. It must be experienced.</p>
<p>内识是如何从一个人转移到另一个人的？它是在无形中被点燃的。我们是在你的内在与内识对话，而不是与你的心智对话。如果你与内识相连，并能体验它，你就会感受到我们所说的深度和影响。这就是内识转移的方式。这就是内识被点燃的方式。这就是真实启动发生的方式。当然，还有一些外部的事情要做，它们需要很多时间和能量。然而，神秘——内识的转移和古老纽带的重合——是任何人都无法用智力理解的。它必须被经历。</p>
<p>You can speculate. You can fantasize. You can theorize. But the Mystery can only be experienced. Therefore, to learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, to learn what Greater Community Spirituality means and why it is so essential for you and for your world, you must begin to have this experience. It will happen in increments, depending upon your desire for it, your resistance to it and your capacity to feel it and to carry it. As your desire and capacity grow and as your resistance lessens, the Mystery will take on greater and greater dimensions, and its rewards will grow for you. Your responsibilities will grow as the Greater Power within you grows. In time, it will speak through you and move through you.</p>
<p>你可以猜测。你可以幻想。你可以理论化。但神秘的内识只能被经历。因此，要学习大社区内识之路，学习大社区精神性的含义，以及为什么它对你和你的世界如此重要，你必须开始有这种经历。它将逐步发生，取决于你对它的渴望、你对它的抵制以及你感受它和承载它的能力。随着你的愿望和能力的增长，以及你的抵抗力的减弱，神秘将呈现出越来越大的规模，它对你的回报也将增长。你的责任将随着你体内更伟大力量的增长而增长。随着时间的推移，它将通过你说话，通过你行动。</p>
<p>Wisdom is meant for the world, but it must be given to individuals, and they must prepare and be able to translate it into the existence, the language and the images of daily life. Pure truth, pure Wisdom, pure affinity and pure relationship cannot be received here yet, except by a rare person here and there. And even these individuals must undergo tremendous development. This is because people’s desire and capacity for truth and honesty, relationship and affinity are so very limited. It is also because people everywhere have dedicated themselves to things that they must learn to outgrow. This takes much time, and there are many failures, but the possibility of success is there.</p>
<p>智慧是为世界准备的，但它必须被赋予个人，他们必须准备并能够将其翻译为日常生活的存在、语言和形象。纯粹的真理、纯粹的智慧、纯粹的亲和力和纯粹的关系在这里还不能被接受，除非是这里和那里的少数人。而即使是这些人也必须经历巨大的发展。这是因为人们对真理和诚实、关系和亲和力的渴望和能力非常有限。这也是因为世界各地的人们都致力于他们必须学会摆脱的关系。这需要很多时间，也有很多失败，但成功的可能性是存在的。</p>
<p>If you follow the way and if you learn the lessons as you go, without adding anything or subtracting anything, you will make the journey. You will pass through the jungle, and you will find the mountain and the way up the mountain. You will proceed in moments when you have vision and in moments when you do not have vision. You will proceed when you can see your goal and when you cannot see your goal. This is meant for you. You may disqualify yourself. You may reject the gift. You may give it other meanings or you may assign terrible associations to it. However, the gift is pure, and you must be pure of heart to receive it.</p>
<p>如果你沿着这条路走，如果你边走边学，不加任何东西，也不减任何东西，你就会完成这段旅程。你将穿过丛林，你将找到山和上山的路。你将在你有远见的时候和你没有远见的时候前进。你将在你能看到你的目标和你看不到你的目标时进行。这是为你准备的。你可以取消自己的资格。你可以拒绝这个礼物。你可能赋予它其他的含义，或者你可能给它赋予可怕的关联。然而，这个礼物是纯洁的，你必须有纯洁的心才能收到它。</p>
<p>To deny a calling in life says nothing about the calling but everything about you. You must be ready, and you must have the experience of truth. People lie to themselves. Their deceptions are in layers and become so deep that even the truth is just a fantasy to them. It is just an idea, something they cannot rely upon or experience. Truth always brings you back into relationship with life, with others and with yourself. Fantasy and deception always take you away. There is fantasy about everything, even about the truth.</p>
<p>拒绝生命中的召唤，说明不了召唤，却说明了你的一切。你必须准备好，你必须有真理的经历。人们对自己撒谎。他们的欺骗层层叠叠，变得如此之深，甚至真理对他们来说也只是一种幻想。它只是一个想法，是他们无法依赖或体验的想法。真理总是把你带回与生命、与他人和与自己的关系中。幻想和欺骗总是把你带走。什么都有幻想，甚至对真理也有幻想。</p>
<p>Many people will attempt to use The Greater Community Way of Knowledge to acquire power, to assure themselves of love and money, to gain advantages in life, to dominate others and to proclaim themselves, but they will not learn The Way of Knowledge. It will escape them entirely. They will only have ideas about it, ideas that they find to be comforting or self-inflating. However, the essence and the meaning, the purpose and the truth of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge will escape them entirely. They will use the words but be lost to the meaning. You will see this.</p>
<p>许多人试图利用大社区内识之路来获取权力，确保自己得到爱情和金钱，在生活中获得优势，支配他人和宣扬自己，但他们不会学习内识之路。他们将完全逃避内识之路。他们只会有关于它的想法，那些他们认为是安慰或自我膨胀的想法。然而，大社区内识之路的本质和意义、目的和真理将被他们完全忽略。他们会使用这些词语，但却迷失在其中的含义。你会看到这一点。</p>
<p>Until you can value truth, choose truth and abide with truth, fantasy will be projected upon everything. Everything will be determined to be useful according to whether it substantiates and furthers your personal aims. How can anything real be found if this is the motivation? Here there will be no vision, no understanding and no comprehension. Things will not be seen as they are. They will not be valued as they are. Real opportunities will be lost, and dangerous opportunities will be chosen.</p>
<p>在你能够珍视真理、选择真理并坚守真理之前，幻想将被投射到一切关系之上。一切关系都将根据它是否能证实和促进你的个人目标来决定是否有用。如果是这样的动机，怎么可能找到真正的关系？在这里，将没有视野，没有理解和领悟。人们不会看到关系的本来面目。它们也不会被按照它们的本来价值来评估。真正的机会将会失去，而危险的机会将会被选择。</p>
<p>Every failure started out as a good idea—something that would lead in a preferred direction, something that would further a personal cause. Let your failures in life, then, disillusion you and sober you, temper you and open your eyes. Accept your failures. Call them failures. They are failures. Let them renew you. Let them clear your vision. Let them free you from future failure. Let them give you discernment. Let them teach you discretion. Let them take you back to truth, which is what you needed to begin with. Things can be known at the outset. Truth is available because Knowledge is within you. This is your gift to receive as it will be your gift to give.</p>
<p>那么，就让你在生活中的失败让你幻灭，让你清醒，让你锤炼，让你睁眼。接受你的失败。称它们为失败。它们就是失败。让它们更新你。让它们清晰你的视野。让它们把你从未来的失败中解放出来。让它们给你辨别能力。让它们教你谨慎。让它们带你回到真理，这是你一开始就需要的真理。真理一开始就可以知道。真理是可以得到的，因为内识就在你里面。这是你要收到的礼物，因为它将是你要给予的礼物。</p>
<p>We have spoken of greater things in this book and will speak of greater things yet. We keep things in a larger context because you need to think about things in a larger context. This will show you how little your fantasies, your goals and your objectives are in contrast to the needs and requirements of the reality in which you live. This is redemptive. This will free you from the bondage of your mind. This will show you that your prison door is open and you need but step outside. Life exists outside.</p>
<p>我们在这本书中谈到了更大的智慧，而且还将谈到更大的目的。我们把内识放在一个更大的背景下，因为你需要在一个更大的背景下思考问题。这将告诉你，你的幻想、你的目标和你的目的与你所处的现实的需要和要求相比是多么的渺小。这是救赎性的。这将把你从心灵的束缚中解放出来。这将告诉你，你的监狱大门是敞开的，你只需要走出去。生命存在于外面。</p>
<p>To be free of the mind is to gain new eyes, to gain new ears, to touch with a new sensation and to see things with a clarity that could only escape you previously. Wisdom leads to this liberation. Yet it does not lead to one great enlightenment experience. It is something that builds every day and gives its gifts every day. It leads you on to meet greater challenges and opportunities which you could not meet before.</p>
<p>摆脱心灵的束缚就是获得新的眼睛，获得新的耳朵，以新的感觉去触摸，并以一种以前无法获得的清晰度来看待事物。智慧导致了这种解放。然而，这并不是一次伟大的顿悟体验。它是一种每天都在积累的东西，每天都在给予它的礼物。它引导你去迎接更大的挑战和机会，而这是你以前无法做到的。</p>
<p>People only have so much time and energy for problem solving. If that time and energy is devoted to little things, it will be used up. If it is devoted to greater things, the little things will get resolved in the process. Little problems require little amounts of energy, and bigger problems require larger amounts of energy. By solving bigger problems, you will feel valued because you are doing something important.</p>
<p>人们只有那么多时间和能量来解决问题。如果这些时间和精力都用在小事上，就会被用完。如果把时间和精力用在更大的事情上，小事情就会在这个过程中得到解决。小问题需要少量的能量，而大问题需要大量的能量。通过解决更大的问题，你会感到有价值，因为你在做重要的事情。</p>
<p>People suffer because their lives lack meaning and necessity. Thus, God gives meaning and necessity. Meaning is found in real engagements with others which serve a real purpose that serves the evolution of the world. Whether this involves feeding people, building bridges or teaching The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, it all serves the same purpose. Service must happen at many different levels—at the personal level, at the family level, at the community level, at the national level and at the level of humanity.</p>
<p>人们痛苦是因为他们的生命缺乏意义和必要性。因此，上帝赋予意义和必要性。意义是在与他人的真正交往中找到的，这些交往有真正的目的，为世界的发展服务。无论这涉及到为人们提供食物、建造桥梁还是教授大社区内识之路，都是为了同一个目的。服务必须发生在许多不同的层面——在个人层面、家庭层面、社区层面、国家层面和人类层面。</p>
<p>We bring to you a challenge, an invitation, an affirmation and a recognition. As vast as it is and as great as it might seem, Greater Community Spirituality—when it is really experienced and when it is really employed—gives you a greater ability to deal with what is in front of you right now. You see what is small, and you recognize it as small. You see something that is great, and you recognize it as great. You do not call everything great; you do not call everything small. You recognize what is great and what is small, what requires a little of your time and what requires a great deal of your time.</p>
<p>我们给你带来一个挑战、一个邀请、一个肯定和一个认可。尽管它很庞大，尽管它可能看起来很伟大，但大社区精神性——当它被真正地体验到，当它被真正地运用时——使你有更大的能力来处理你现在面前的事情。你看到小的事情，你就承认它是小的。你看到伟大的内识，你就承认它是伟大的。你不会把所有事情都称为伟大；你也不会把所有事情都称为渺小。你认识到什么是伟大的，什么是渺小的，什么需要你花一点时间，什么需要你花大量时间。</p>
<p>Time well employed is time fulfilled. Time not well employed is time lost and wasted. You have only so much time in life; you have only so much ability in life. Where are your time and ability invested? Where are they given and what purpose do they serve? What part of you do they satisfy? Your personal mind, which is at the surface of your mind, is never satisfied. It must have more of everything. Its experience of happiness is momentary. It requires constant stimulation and acquisition in order to feel any kind of self-assurance because it only identifies with what it owns, both its physical possessions and its ideas, which its physical possessions are meant to validate.</p>
<p>时间用得好，就是时间的满足。没有很好地利用的时间就是失去和浪费的时间。你一生中只有这么多时间；你一生中只有这么多能力。你的时间和能力投资在哪里？它们在哪里被给予，它们的目的是什么？它们满足了你的哪一部分？你的个人心智，也就是你心灵的表面，永远不会满足。它必须拥有更多的东西。它对幸福的体验是短暂的。它需要不断的刺激和获取，以便感受到任何形式的自我保证，因为它只认同它所拥有的东西，包括它的物质财产和它的想法，而它的物质财产是为了验证这些想法。</p>
<p>Satisfy Knowledge within you and your life will be fulfilled. You will be given a new life, a greater life, a life that is simple and meaningful, a life that is powerful and effective, a life where you have real companions who are devoted to you and to whom you are devoted. And you will escape the great majority of the miseries that imprison everyone.</p>
<p>满足你内心的内识，你的生命就会得到满足。你将获得一种新的生命，一种更伟大的生命，一种简单而有意义的生命，一种强大而有效的生命，一种你有真正的同伴，他们对你倾心，你也对他们倾心。而且你将摆脱囚禁每个人的绝大部分苦难。</p>
<p>If you can make this journey and if you can choose this journey again and again, you will advance. If you quit, you will not advance. The journey is the way. You will only know it is the way if you travel it. Do not stand at the beginning and say, “Well, I’m not sure. Is this the way or should I do something else? Something else looks better. Something else looks quicker. Something else looks more pleasurable.” Do not be deceived. You can only find the way if you travel it. The Way of Knowledge cannot be understood by standing outside of it and judging it. When people do that, they are only attempting to validate their ideas. Travel this journey and you will find out where it takes you. Where it takes you is to the truth that lives within you, to the truth that lives within others and to the truth that lives within the world. Then Greater Community Spirituality will make perfect sense to you because it will be obvious. Once you gain this vantage point, you will see how clear it is and you will also see why you could not have seen it before.</p>
<p>如果你能完成这个旅程，如果你能一次又一次地选择这个旅程，你就会进步。如果你放弃，你将不会进步。旅程就是道路。只有当你走过它，你才会知道它是一条路。不要站在一开始就说：”嗯，我不确定。是这条道路还是我应该做别的事情？别的事情看起来更好。其他的看起来更快。别的东西看起来更有乐趣”。不要被欺骗。只有当你走过这条路时，你才能找到这条道路。站在内识之路之外，对它进行评判，是无法理解它的。当人们这样做时，他们只是试图验证他们的想法。走过这段旅程，你会发现它把你带到哪里。它把你带到了生活在你内在的真理，带到了生活在他人内在的真理，带到了生活在世界之中的真理。然后，大社区精神性对你来说将是完全有意义的，因为它将是显而易见的。一旦你获得了这个观测点，你就会看到它是多么清晰，你也会看到为什么你以前无法看到它。</p>
<p>God’s first purpose is to unburden you in life so that a greater gift, a greater opportunity and a greater calling can be given to you. If your hands are full of your own necessities, how can you receive anything else? If your mind is filled to the brim with stimulating and exciting ideas, how can any real insight emerge or be given to you? First there must be an emptying out, a simplification, an unburdening. You don’t have to carry all of this baggage through life—the baggage of your possessions and your ideas. You keep what is needed and what is truly meaningful, and other things are simply given away because they are seen as burdensome. Nothing is taken from you. There are no thieves on the path to truth. Truth only gives and restores, verifies and confirms what is true in your relationship with everything, and most fundamentally with yourself.</p>
<p>上帝的第一个目的是解除你在生命中的负担，以便能给你一个更大的礼物、更大的机会和更大的召唤。如果你的双手充满了自己的必需品，你怎么能接收其他东西呢？如果你心灵中充满了刺激和兴奋的想法，又怎么能出现或给予你任何真正的洞察力？首先必须有一个清空，一个简化，一个解除负担的过程。你不必在生命中携带所有这些包袱——你的财产和想法的包袱。你保留需要的财产和真正有意义的想法，而其他想法则被简单地舍弃，因为它们被视为负担。没有什么能从你身上拿走。在通往真理的道路上，没有小偷。真理只给予和恢复，验证和确认你与一切生命关系中的真实，最根本的是与你自己。</p>
<p>Who is Wisdom meant for? It is meant for you. Through you it is meant for others, and through them it will be passed on again. This is possible because Knowledge lives within each person and because Knowledge is recognized, valued, confirmed and experienced within the context of real and meaningful relationships. Though the world seems incomprehensible and dedicated to self-deception, dishonesty and destruction, the reality of Knowledge that lives within each person lives today at this moment. It is this reality that must be confirmed. It is this preparation in The Way of Knowledge that must be given and shared. Then what seemed impossible before becomes apparent and achievable. Then what seemed confusing and complex before becomes a simple path through a dangerous jungle.</p>
<p>智慧是为谁准备的？它是为你准备的。通过你，它是为他人准备的，通过他们，它将再次传递下去。这是可能的，因为内识存在于每个人之中，并且因为内识在真实和有意义的关系背景中被认识、重视、确认和体验。尽管世界看起来不可理解，充满了自欺、虚伪和破坏的倾向，但每个人内在的内识现实今天此刻依然存在。这是必须被确认的现实。这是必须在内识之路中给予和分享的准备。然后，以前看起来不可能的内识变得明显和可以实现。然后，以前看似混乱和复杂的准备工作变成了一条穿过危险丛林的简单道路。</p>
<p>The path you will follow is a simple path, but you will need to watch every step and be attentive to what is around you. In this way, you will move into life and through life, and you will have direction. You will be able to see everything around you with a greater understanding. And you will be able to see that which can move and that which cannot move, that which can advance and that which cannot advance, that which has purpose and that which does not have purpose. This can only be found by traveling the way. Therefore, the way is the answer.</p>
<p>你将要走的道路是一条简单的道路，但你需要注意每一步，并关注你周围的一切。通过这种方式，你将进入生命，走过生命，并拥有方向。你将能够以更深的理解来看待你周围的一切。你将能够看到那些可以移动的和不能移动的，可以前进的和不能前进的，有目的的和没有目的的一切。只有通过走这条道路才能发现这些。因此，道路就是答案。</p>
