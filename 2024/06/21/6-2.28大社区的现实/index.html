<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on May 18, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年5月18日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have mentioned in many of our presentations the idea that the world is emerging into the Greater Community. What is the Greater Community? What does it really mean? And what are its implications for humanity? We shall speak a little on this now, though we will not give you all the information because there is so much, and so much of it would be meaningless and incomprehensible to you. Instead, we shall focus on the aspects that have bearing on your future and your fate and that have meaning and importance for your education and development now.</p>
<p>我们在许多演讲中都提到了世界正在进入大社区的想法。什么是大社区？它的真正含义是什么？它对人类的影响是什么？我们现在将谈一谈这个问题，尽管我们不会给你提供所有的信息，因为信息量太大，而且很多信息对你来说是没有意义的，无法理解的。相反，我们将专注于对你的未来和命运有影响的方面，对你现在的教育和发展有意义和重要性。</p>
<p>The world is emerging into a Greater Community. That does not mean that the world is going anywhere or that you will be penetrating space anytime soon. What it means is that your world is developing into a global community and that you have discovered certain kinds of powers and technology that make you a force to be recognized and reckoned with by other cultures living in your proximity beyond this solar system.</p>
<p>世界正在变成一个大社区。这并不意味着世界会消失，也不意味着你们很快就会进入太空。它的意思是，你们的世界正在发展成为一个全球社区，而且你们已经发现了某些类型的力量和技术，使你们成为生活在这个太阳系之外的、与你们相近的其他文化所认可和考虑的力量。</p>
<p>As a primitive race, you offered no threat or competition to your neighbors, and though your world was used as a depository for certain secret devices by various groups and frequently visited in order to gather plant and animal specimens for other worlds, it was not considered a meaningful location until very recently. A turning point came at the beginning of this century with the development of electricity and took another great step forward with the development of atomic power. These represent important milestones in the development of a civilization and, commensurate with this, stimulated greater interest from the Greater Community in the development of your world.</p>
<p>作为一个原始的种族，你们对你们的邻居没有提供任何威胁或竞争，尽管你们的世界被各种团体用作某些秘密装置的存放处，并经常被访问，以便为其他世界收集植物和动物标本，但直到最近，它才被视为一个有意义的地点。本世纪初，随着电力的发展出现了一个转折点，并随着原子能的发展又向前迈进了一大步。这些代表了一个文明发展的重要里程碑，与此相称的是，激发了大社区对你们世界发展的更大兴趣。</p>
<p>Though the world has been used as a depository and a laboratory for a very long time, there has been no serious intervention here since colonies were established many thousands of years ago. The human race was developed and advanced during this time with the infusion of genetic material from beyond, and this represented a great step forward in humanity’s evolution at that time. But since then there has been little or no intervention, with the exception of the introduction of religious symbols and hybrid individuals in order to advance the spiritual understanding of your race. These are not gods or angels but simply individuals who possessed greater understanding and greater intellectual powers. Their infrequent presence in the world is a sign that humanity has a relationship with the Greater Community, a relationship which you must now begin to recognize, accept and cultivate.</p>
<p>虽然这个世界在很长一段时间内被用作存放和实验室，但自从几千年前建立殖民地以来，这里一直没有认真的干预。在这段时间里，随着来自外部的遗传物质的注入，人类得到了发展和进步，这代表着人类在当时的进化中迈出了一大步。但从那时起，除了引入宗教符号和混合个体以推进你们种族的精神理解外，几乎没有任何干预。这些人不是神或天使，只是拥有更多理解力和更大智慧的个体。他们不经常出现在这个世界上，这表明人类与大社区有一种关系，这种关系你现在必须开始认识、接受和培养。</p>
<p>Spiritual development has been fostered and furthered here by foreign races so that your race, as it evolves, would have greater promise to be a productive and meaningful part of the Greater Community in the future. This is to counteract the animal nature in human beings so that your higher qualities may be stimulated and developed. Though this shows promise, the acceleration of your technology and its destructive applications, according to your old tribal mentality and your old tribal conflicts and wars, now pose a serious threat to your existence and create an alarm in the Greater Community. This alarm is not shared by all, and indeed many consider your development something of an opportunity rather than a concern only.</p>
<p>精神发展在这里得到了外来种族的培育和推动，以便你们的种族在进化过程中，更有希望在未来成为大社区中富有成效和有意义的一部分。这是为了抵制人类的动物本性，以便你们的高级品质可以得到刺激和发展。虽然这显示了希望，但根据你们旧的部落心态和你们旧的部落冲突和战争，你们的技术的加速及其破坏性的应用，现在对你们的生存构成了严重的威胁，并在大社区中产生了警报。这种警报并不是所有种族都有的，事实上，许多人认为你们的发展是一种机会，而不仅仅是一种担忧。</p>
<p>You see, in the Greater Community, particularly in this part of the galaxy, there are many alliances based upon trade and other mutual benefits. There are conflicts as well. It is necessary for you to understand this so that you will not think that everyone and everything revolves around the world you live in. This is an unfortunate remnant of a primitive idea. It is understandable, though, given your isolation in the world and minimal contact with other intelligent life. But it remains a prevailing idea and one that must be seriously challenged and weeded out of your consciousness, or you will have no possibility of understanding the motives or the abilities of those who are visiting the world now and who will visit in the future.</p>
<p>你看，在大社区中，特别是在银河系的这一部分，有许多基于贸易和其他互利的联盟。也有冲突。你有必要理解这一点，这样你就不会认为每个种族和每件事都是围绕着你们生活的世界。这是一个不幸的原始想法的残余。虽然这是可以理解的，因为你们在这个世界上与世隔绝，与其他智慧生命的接触很少。但它仍然是一个普遍的想法，而且必须被认真地挑战并从你的意识中剔除，否则你将没有可能理解那些现在正在访问这个世界和将来会访问者的动机或能力。</p>
<p>Because you live in a Greater Community reality rather than only in a human reality, the world is influenced by the Greater Community and will be so increasingly as time advances. Greater Community intervention in the world will increase because competing races are here both to safeguard themselves against the destruction of your environment, which they consider to be too valuable to destroy, and to engage in possible resource development and future alliances with humanity should you ever be able to form a world community. Until this community is formed, alliance with the world would not be practical. No foreign power wants to become involved in the intertribal warfare of a domestic race. There is no advantage to this.</p>
<p>因为你们生活在一个大社区的现实中，而不是仅仅生活在人类的现实中，所以世界受到大社区的影响，而且随着时间的推移，这种影响会越来越大。大社区对世界的干预将增加，因为竞争的种族在这里既是为了保护自己，防止你们的环境被破坏，他们认为环境太有价值而不能破坏，也是为了参与可能的资源开发和未来与人类的联盟，如果你们能够形成一个世界社区的话。在这个社区形成之前，与这个世界的结盟将是不切实际的。没有外来势力愿意卷入一个世界内种族的部落间战争。这样做没有任何好处。</p>
<p>There are several different interests which are represented by your visitors. They are not aligned with each other and in some cases are even in competition with each other. Yet, there is a general consensus, given the priorities of advancing races in the Greater Community, that your environment must be preserved even if your race destroys itself. You see, in the Greater Community, environment is considered more important than racial survival. Here you have a natural world with millions of species of plants and animals, a magnificent creation, the result of millions of years of development, all now at risk because of one selfish race that is spoiling the world out of ignorance and greed.</p>
<p>有几个不同的利益，它们由你们的访客代表。他们彼此并不一致，在某些情况下甚至相互竞争。然而，考虑到在大社区中推进种族的优先次序，有一个普遍的共识，即你们的环境必须得到保护，即使你们的种族毁灭了也要如此。你看，在大社区，环境被认为比种族生存更重要。在这里，你们有一个拥有数百万种植物和动物的自然世界，这是一个宏伟的创造，是数百万年发展的结果，现在都处于危险之中，因为一个自私的种族由于无知和贪婪而破坏了这个世界。</p>
<p>Many people are now becoming concerned for the environment because they are concerned about the future of the race, the future of the availability of resources, the future of the quality of life, and for some even the ability of the race to survive in a declining environment. This, of course, is very important and is born of a greater understanding. It is also important because you live in a Greater Community. Here you must realize that your world is a valuable part of the Greater Community and that it is considered amongst advancing races in the Greater Community that environments such as yours belong to everyone, even though certain races have a stewardship role that is honored.</p>
<p>许多人现在开始关注环境问题，因为他们关注种族的未来，关注资源供应的未来，关注生活质量的未来，对一些人来说，甚至关注种族在日益衰退的环境中的生存能力。当然，这非常重要，是源于更多的理解。它也很重要，因为你们生活在一个大社区。在这里，你必须认识到，你的世界是大社区的一个有价值的部分，而且在大社区的进步种族中，认为像你们这样的环境属于每个人，尽管某些种族有一个受尊重的管理角色。</p>
<p>What this means for you is that should you fail to join as a world community and should your environment be threatened past a point where its reclamation can be assured, then others will intervene, not to conquer you but to preserve the environment. That is why there is a great deal of study by your visitors now on plants and animals, in order to preserve both your race and the environment and to be able to participate in this environment should humanity fail.</p>
<p>这对你们来说意味着，如果你们不能作为一个世界社区加入，如果你们的环境受到威胁，超过了可以保证其复垦的程度，那么其他种族将进行干预，不是为了征服你们，而是为了保护环境。这就是为什么你们的来访者现在对植物和动物有大量的研究，以保护你们的种族和环境，并在人类失败时能够参与这个环境。</p>
<p>Perhaps this seems frightening and too radical for you to consider, but it is the reality in which you live. It gives great impetus and importance to our emphasis on Knowledge and on contribution in the world. People are casual about these things because they do not see their relevance and importance. Many people are casual even about meeting the necessities of their lives because they do not consider the consequences of neglecting them. Many people are casual about their spirituality because they think it is an addendum to their other interests, goals and priorities. Yet, in reality this is not the case.</p>
<p>也许这看起来很可怕，对你们来说过于激进，但这就是你们生活的现实。它为我们强调内识和对世界的贡献提供了巨大的动力和重要性。人们对这些事情很随意，因为他们没有看到其相关性和重要性。许多人甚至对满足他们生活的需要也很随意，因为他们没有考虑到忽视这些的后果。许多人对自己的精神信仰很随意，因为他们认为这是他们其他兴趣、目标和优先事项的一个补充。然而，在现实中，情况并非如此。</p>
<p>Your world is an evolving world. It is so considered by your neighbors and by your visitors from afar. Some are here to attempt to rescue things that were buried long ago because they are concerned that the environment of the world may be so compromised that in the future it may not be possible to rescue these things. Others are here to determine ways that they may introduce their genetic materials into the human race in order that the human race may, so to speak, take a quantum leap in its evolutionary development. And other interests are here to discern the possibility of your replacement should you fail. This is a real possibility, and given the events of the last forty years, it has become greater than ever. Because there is not yet a consensus amongst humanity to join together to meet its environmental and social needs, the risks have grown much greater. Therefore, Greater Community intervention in the world has increased dramatically and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>你们的世界是一个不断进化的世界。你们的邻居和来自遥远地方的访客也是这样认为的。有些人在这里尝试挽救长期埋藏的东西，因为他们担心世界的环境可能已经受到如此严重的影响，以至于将来可能无法挽救这些东西。还有些种族在这里寻找方法，希望能够将他们的基因材料引入人类种族，以便让人类在进化发展上，可以说是迈向一个量子飞跃。还有其他利益在这里评估如果你们失败的话，是否有替代的可能性。这是一个真实的可能性，考虑到过去四十年的事件，这种可能性比以往任何时候都更加真实。由于人类尚未就如何共同解决环境和社会需求达成共识，风险变得更加巨大。因此，大社区在世界中的干预显著增加，并将继续增加。</p>
<p>Some people think that these visitors are here to bring enlightenment to humanity. Others think that they are here to take over the world. And of course many people think there is no Greater Community visitation at all! Regardless of what people think and what they like to believe, you live in a Greater Community reality, and you are merging into this reality because you are becoming more involved with it every day. This is a product of your own development and the result of human error. It is also a product of the events and dynamics of Greater Community life.</p>
<p>有些人认为，这些来访者是来给人类带来启迪的。其他人认为他们是来接管世界的。当然，也有很多人认为根本就没有大社区的来访！这是不可能的。不管人们怎么想，怎么愿意相信，你们生活在一个大社区的现实中，你们正在融入这个现实，因为你们每天都在与它融合。这是你们自身发展的产物，也是人类错误的结果。它也是大社区生活的事件和动态的产物。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, the advancing race of any solar system is considered the master of that solar system and rarely will outside intervention occur. History has proven that the conquest of one race over another is too costly and too destructive. There are more subtle ways to influence nations, and in this, the development of skill in the mental environment has been the great emphasis for those who are interested in conquest and acquisition. Brute force is too destructive, requires too much effort and often produces unwanted results. This is a lesson that most advanced worlds have learned. There are more subtle forms of persuasion in the mental environment, and we have touched upon this in many of our discourses in this book. We have introduced the idea of the mental environment in its relevance to your life. Development in the mental environment and development in Greater Community Knowledge must come about and can only come about through diligent practice and preparation in Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>在大社区中，任何太阳系的进步种族都被认为是该太阳系的主宰，很少会发生外部干预。历史已经证明，一个种族对另一个种族的征服成本太高，破坏性太大。有更微妙的方法来影响国家，在这一点上，心理环境中的技能发展一直是那些对征服和获取感兴趣的人的最大重点。蛮力的破坏性太大，需要太多的努力，而且往往产生不想要的结果。这是大多数先进世界已经学到的教训。在心理环境中还有更微妙的说服形式，我们在本书的许多论述中都提到了这一点。我们已经介绍了心理环境与你的生活相关的概念。心理环境的发展和大社区内识的发展必须实现，而且只能通过勤奋的练习和内识步骤的准备来实现。</p>
<p>What we are introducing here is a larger perspective so that you can understand more completely the predicament of your world and the opportunities that are offered to you now. Understanding should precede action in order for action to be meaningful and wisely employed.</p>
<p>我们在这里介绍的是一个更大的视角，以便你能更全面地理解你世界的困境和现在提供给你的机会。理解应该先于行动，这样的行动才有意义，才是明智之举。</p>
<p>The Greater Community is with you now. You are learning about it. It is influencing your thoughts. It is influencing your images. It is influencing your art and your psychology. It is having an impact on your physical environment. Indeed, around the world individuals are encountering Greater Community intelligences who are either observing them or studying them for various purposes. Yet, because humanity’s focus is so diffused and distracted by small and meaningless things and because humanity cannot reach a consensus about even the most obvious things, these Greater Community interventions arouse minimal response, understanding and awareness.</p>
<p>大社区现在和你们在一起。你们正在学习它。它正影响着你们的思想。它正在影响你们的形象。它正在影响你们的艺术和你们的心理学。它正在对你们的物理环境产生影响。事实上，在世界各地，个人都遇到了大社区的智慧生命，他们或者在观察人类，或者出于各种目的研究人类。然而，由于人类的注意力是如此分散，并被一些小的和无意义的事情所干扰，也由于人类无法对最明显的事情达成共识，这些大社区的干预引起的反应、理解和意识是最小的。</p>
<p>The world here is quite unique in the development of its biology and the temperateness of its climate. This, of course, has been known for some time by races who have visited here. But because of its biological richness, it has been difficult for many races to settle here, because of the world’s specific atmospheric conditions and because of the presence of so many biological entities. When you consider that advanced races who are engaged actively in space travel generally live in sterile environments for most of their existence, to enter an environment with such biological diversity poses a tremendous hazard. Even many advanced races live underground where they are able to sterilize their environment and thus protect their populations from disease very effectively. So, as the world is rich and abundant in life, it is also a difficult environment to adapt to for these same reasons.</p>
<p>这里的世界在其生物的发展和气候的温差方面是相当独特的。当然，这一点已经被访问过这里的种族知道了一段时间。但是，由于其生物的丰富性，许多种族很难在这里定居，因为这个世界的特殊大气条件，也因为有这么多的生物实体存在。当你考虑到那些积极从事太空旅行的先进种族通常大部分时间都生活在无菌环境中时，进入一个具有如此生物多样性的环境会带来巨大的危险。甚至许多先进的种族都生活在地下，他们能够对环境进行消毒，从而非常有效地保护他们的人口免受疾病侵害。因此，由于世界上有丰富的生命，由于这些同样的原因，这个世界也是一个难以适应的环境。</p>
<p>A great deal of study is being undertaken currently to understand the biological mechanisms here in order to prevent illness so that Greater Community individuals and groups of individuals can temporarily inhabit the world for their own purposes.</p>
<p>目前正在进行大量的研究，以理解这里的生物机制，以便预防疾病，使大社区的个体和群体能够为自己的目的暂时居住在这个世界上。</p>
<p>Humanity is at a very crucial turning point. It is in an adolescent stage of its development, adolescent in the respect that it is discovering greater technological powers but is lacking maturity, accountability and responsibility, which makes the discovery of these powers very hazardous indeed.</p>
<p>人类正处于一个非常关键的转折点。它正处于发展的青春期阶段，青春期是指它正在发现更大的技术力量，但缺乏成熟度、问责制和责任感，这使得这些力量的发现确实非常危险。</p>
<p>In the world, there is now the capability of not only poisoning the environment but destroying the human race. This is of grave concern to your neighbors, not that they value human existence particularly, but they value this environment. It is in their collective interest to maintain this environment, even if they cannot live within it. The human race, then, poses a threat to Greater Community interests, and given the ethics of Greater Community cooperation and understanding, it is allowable to displace a race that is threatening its own environment. This is admissible within this part of the Greater Community in which you live, which is in no way a remote part of the galaxy.</p>
<p>在世界上，现在不仅有毒化环境的能力，还有毁灭人类的能力。这是你们的邻居们严重关切的问题，不是说他们特别重视人类的存在，而是他们重视这个环境。维护这个环境符合他们的集体利益，即使他们不能生活在这个环境中。那么，人类对大社区的利益构成了威胁，考虑到大社区合作和理解的道德规范，取代一个威胁自己环境的种族是允许的。它在你们所居住的大社区的这一部分是可以接受的，而你们并不是银河系中的一个遥远角落。</p>
<p>Another reason there has been limited Greater Community involvement in the world in the past is because other planets in your solar system are inhospitable, and mining and resource development have proven to be more costly than they are worth. Therefore, you have one inhabitable planet alone in a very large solar system. However, even as we speak, there are Greater Community establishments being built on other worlds in this solar system, mostly to observe the earth. Because of this, your visitors do not have to travel very far to reach the surface of your world, and so they can take their data and their specimens to their respective areas of study. Your solar system does afford many opportunities for this. But as a whole your solar system is quite limited in terms of Greater Community interests, with the exception of your planet.</p>
<p>另一个原因是，过去大社区对这个世界的参与是有限的，因为你们太阳系的其他星球都是荒凉的，采矿和资源开发被证明是得不偿失的。因此，在一个非常大的太阳系中，你们只有一个可居住的星球。然而，即使在我们说话的时候，在这个太阳系的其他世界上也有大社区机构正在建立，主要是为了观察地球。正因为如此，你们的访客不需要走很远就能到达你们世界的表面，因此他们可以把他们的数据和标本带到各自的研究领域。你们的太阳系确实提供了许多这样的机会。但是作为一个整体，你们的太阳系在大社区的利益方面是相当有限的，除了你们的星球之外。</p>
<p>Adaptation to foreign environments is a very serious matter, and many worlds which may be considered rich in resources have proven too difficult to explore and to exploit. Barren worlds are actively exploited if they can be reached and if establishments can be built, either on the surface or underground. They are not considered valuable environments. However, your world is considered valuable, and there is great interest in and emphasis on preserving this environment, whether humanity can evolve successfully or not.</p>
<p>适应外来环境是一个非常严重的问题，许多可能被认为资源丰富的世界被证明太难探索和开发了。如果可以到达贫瘠的世界，如果可以在地表或地下建立机构，就会被积极开发。它们不被认为是有价值的环境。然而，你们的世界被认为是有价值的，无论人类能否成功进化，都对保护这个环境有极大的兴趣和重视。</p>
<p>We are not trying to scare you or threaten you by saying these things. We want you to have a greater understanding of the world in which you live and of the Greater Community in which you live. You are not immune from the Greater Community and you are not isolated in the universe. As a matter of fact, human civilization is remarkably accessible, given that you are surface dwellers and do not live underground. Your activities, your communications, your establishments and your conflicts are easily seen by the discreet observer. The fact that human beings are still very superstitious means that your ideas and images can easily be controlled.</p>
<p>我们说这些话并不是想吓唬你或威胁你。我们希望你对自己所处的世界和自己所处的大社区有更多的了解。你们并不能从大社区中获得豁免，你们在宇宙中也不是孤立的。事实上，鉴于你们是地表居民而不是生活在地下，人类文明是非常容易接近的。你们的活动，你们的通讯，你们的机构和你们的冲突，很容易被谨慎的观察者看到。人类仍然非常迷信的事实意味着你们的想法和形象很容易被控制。</p>
<p>One of the important thresholds for people is to learn to distinguish between material reality and spiritual reality. This distinction is clear in the minds of those who have developed this advantage in the Greater Community, and we should mention here that not many races have really been successful in developing this understanding, so it is not universally held. Human beings have difficulty distinguishing between a physical event and a spiritual event. This makes it very easy to fool you. Project an image and people will think that they are having a religious experience! Carry out a physical activity in the world and people may think that it is a projection of their own psychology. These levels of reality, then, have not adequately been distinguished. Therefore, humanity is easily confused by new experiences and strange events.</p>
<p>对于人类来说，一个重要的门槛是学会区分物质现实和精神现实。这一区别在大社区中已经获得这种优势的种族的心中是清晰的，我们应该提到，真正成功发展这种理解的种族并不多，因此这种理解并不是普遍存在的。人类很难区分物理事件和精神事件。这使得你们很容易被愚弄。投射一个影像，人们就会认为他们正在经历一次宗教体验！在世界上进行一项物理活动，人们可能会认为这是他们自己心理的投射。因此，这些现实层次并没有被充分区分开来。因此，人类很容易被新的体验和奇怪的事件所迷惑。</p>
<p>Those visitors who are investigating the biology of your world are carrying on their work. Their work represents several different motives. These groups are not all in cooperation with each other. They are carrying on their work regardless of whether they are seen or not. There is not that great an emphasis placed on hiding from people because people offer very little challenge, mentally or physically. During the dark nights of the year, visits can be made. Certain people will be aroused, and witnesses will see things, but this in general does not obstruct the activities of your visitors.</p>
<p>那些正在调查你们世界的生物学的访客正在进行他们的工作。他们的工作代表了几种不同的动机。这些团体并不都是相互合作的。他们正在进行他们的工作，不管他们是否被看到。没有那么强调躲避人们，因为人们在心理上或身体上提供的挑战很少。在一年中的黑夜里，可以进行访问。某些人会被唤醒，目击者会看到一些事情，但这在一般情况下并不妨碍你们访客的活动。</p>
<p>In this part of the Greater Community, there is no ruling world or ruling body. There is no center of government. There is only a center of trade between participating nations. This is a great federation, but its primary purpose is to maintain trade. What goes on outside the jurisdiction of this trade is anybody’s business. Within the established areas and parameters of trade, there are ruling guidelines for behavior. But this government of commerce, as you could call it, does not interfere in internal affairs. Only if one world is threatening another militarily can there be any possibility of intervention, but this is very rare. Worlds are far too distant from each other to enforce uniformity. Races are far too different from each other to have common values.</p>
<p>在大社区的这一部分，没有统治的世界或统治的机构。没有政府的中心。只有一个参与国之间的贸易中心。这是一个强大的联邦，但其主要目的是维持贸易。在这个贸易管辖范围之外发生的事情与任何种族都有关。在既定的贸易区域和范围内，有裁定的行为准则。但这个商业政府，你可以称它为，不干涉内部事务。只有当一个世界在军事上威胁到另一个世界时，才有可能进行干预，但这是非常罕见的。各个世界之间的距离太遥远，无法执行统一性。各个种族之间的差异性太大，无法拥有共同的价值观。</p>
<p>There are certain ethical principles that are established for the convenience of interacting with other worlds within a general area. These are more like codes of ethics in order to preserve peace. One of the codes of ethics is the preservation of all biological environments. This holds true in the region in which your world exists. It is enforced for practical and expedient reasons. Terrestrial worlds such as yours are rare and represent valuable biological components that can be duplicated and introduced in other worlds where life is being colonized or is already established.</p>
<p>有一些道德原则是为了方便在一般区域内与其他世界互动而建立的。这些更像是道德准则，以维护和平。其中一个道德准则是保护所有的生物环境。这在你的世界所处的地区是正确的。它是出于实际和权宜之计而执行的。像你们这样的陆地世界是罕见的，代表着有价值的生物成分，可以被复制并引入其他正在殖民或已经建立生命的世界中。</p>
<p>You see, many races who are now involved in intergalactic travel exhausted their world’s resources long ago. In some cases, they have compromised the productivity of other worlds. They are now dependent upon trade for their vital resources. In order to revitalize their own food-processing abilities, they visit worlds such as yours to collect samples. The fact that an indigenous race on earth is threatening such a magnificent storehouse of biological materials is naturally of concern to them. Your conventional warfare in the past, though locally destructive, posed no great threat to the world overall. Therefore, it has not been a cause for intervention. But the development of atomic energy, world pollution and biological warfare have aroused grave concern for the safety of this world.</p>
<p>你看，许多现在参与星际旅行的种族很久以前就耗尽了他们世界的资源。在某些情况下，他们已经损害了其他世界的生产力。他们现在依赖贸易来获得他们的重要资源。为了重振他们自己的食物加工能力，他们访问像你们这样的世界来收集样本。地球上的一个本土种族正在威胁着这样一个宏伟的生物材料仓库，这自然是他们所关心的。你们过去的常规战争，虽然具有局部的破坏性，但对世界整体没有构成很大的威胁。因此，它没有成为干预的原因。然而，原子能的开发、世界污染和生物战争却引起了对这个世界安全的严重担忧。</p>
<p>Now, this is difficult for people to hear and to understand because they think that they are the most important thing in the universe and that even their natural environment is second to this, as well as everything else that lives in the world. It is generally considered that everything else is expendable as long as humanity is prospering. The environment is being used up and thrown away. Other species are being destroyed at random with very little regard except by a few sensitive individuals amongst you. This recklessness and irresponsibility is generating Greater Community involvement at this time. Ways are being considered as to how to neutralize your destructive behaviors, how to preserve the environment and, by some who have your interests at heart, how to revitalize and introduce greater ethical standards and moral strength into your race.</p>
<p>现在，这对人们来说很难听到和理解，因为人类认为自己是宇宙中最重要的种族，甚至他们的自然环境也是次要的，还有生活在这个世界上的其他一切。人们普遍认为，只要人类在繁荣发展，其他一切都可以牺牲掉。环境正在被用完和扔掉。其他物种正在被随意摧毁，除了你们中少数敏感的人之外，几乎没有人考虑过。这种鲁莽和不负责任的行为在这个时候引起了大社区参与。正在考虑如何中和你们的破坏性行为，如何保护环境，以及由一些以你们的利益为重的外族考虑如何振兴并在你们的种族中引入更大的道德标准和道德力量。</p>
<p>This is very important for you to understand. The great difficulty here, from a human standpoint, is being able to gain a Greater Community perspective. We are giving you this information so that you can begin to develop a Greater Community perspective. It does not matter that you believe what we are saying or not. Much of what we are saying may challenge many of your ideas and beliefs, but we are only presenting the facts of the situation. We are not trying to scare you. You need to gain a Greater Community perspective. Until this happens, you will not understand what you are doing, what is happening in your world and what its future possibilities are. You will certainly not understand Greater Community visitations, and you will not understand the emphasis and purpose of other intelligent life that are interacting with your world.</p>
<p>这对你的理解非常重要。从人类的角度来看，这里最大的困难是能够获得一个大社区的视角。我们给你这些信息是为了让你能够开始发展大社区的观点。你是否相信我们所说的，并不重要。我们所说的大部分内容可能会挑战你的许多想法和信仰，但我们只是在介绍情况的事实。我们不是要吓唬你。你需要获得一个大社区的视角。在这之前，你不会明白你在做什么，你的世界正在发生什么，它的未来可能性是什么。你肯定不会理解大社区的访问，你也不会理解与你们世界互动的其他智慧生命的重点和目的。</p>
<p>We are, therefore, very emphatic in encouraging the development of Knowledge, for this is the source of your responsibility and moral accountability. With Knowledge, you will know what to do and will be able to do what is right. You will be able to carry on constructive behavior and activities and divorce yourself from those things which only hurt you and others. We are emphatic in encouraging the development of a Greater Community perspective, for as long as you think within your isolated human perspective, you will not understand yourself, your capabilities or the events that are taking place in your world. You must have a greater perspective to see greater things. You must have a more universal or complete perception and understanding in order to see beyond the limits of your own thinking. This is possible, and it is most assuredly necessary.</p>
<p>因此，我们非常强调要鼓励发展内识，因为这是你的责任和道德责任的来源。有了内识，你将知道该做什么，并能够做正确的事情。你将能够进行建设性的行为和活动，并从那些只会伤害你和他人的事情中脱离出来。我们强调鼓励发展大社区视角，因为只要你在你孤立的人类视角中思考，你就不会理解你自己，你的能力或在你的世界中发生的事件。你必须有一个更大的视角，才能看到更大的事情。你必须有一个更普遍或完整的感知和理解，以便超越你自己思维的限制。这是有可能的，也是最有必要的。</p>
<p>People will always be preoccupied with their own personal needs and endeavors. Only a few amongst you will look into the bigger picture to see beyond these preoccupations, to discern the direction of your world and its possibilities for humanity. This represents a greater perspective. For these individuals, a Greater Community perspective will be particularly helpful because when you see and accept that you are not the center of the universe and that not everything that is happening is happening for you, you will be in a position to take greater responsibility for your actions and to see yourself as part of a Greater Community of life.</p>
<p>人们总是专注于自己的个人需求和努力。你们中只有少数人会从大局出发，超越这些关注点，辨别你们世界的方向和人类的可能性。这代表了一种更大的视角。对于这些人来说，大社区的视角将特别有帮助，因为当你看到并接受人类不是宇宙的中心，不是所有正在发生的事情都是为人类而发生的，你将有能力为你的行为承担更大的责任，并将自己视为生命大社区的一部分。</p>
<p>The Greater Community is not bound by human preoccupations, human ideals, human beliefs or human assumptions. Many of its societies are more advanced than yours—spiritually and technologically. Therefore, developing a Greater Community perspective puts you in a position to learn a great deal, a position that you would not be able to assume otherwise.</p>
<p>大社区不受人类的关注、人类的理想、人类的信仰或人类的假设所约束。它的许多社会在精神上和技术上都比你们的社会更先进。因此，发展大社区的观点使你处于一个可以学到很多知识的位置，这是你在其他情况下无法实现的。</p>
<p>Greater Wisdom is possible for humanity, but in order for it to be received rather than denied or resented, a greater reality must be presented—a greater need for humanity, a greater need for your world and a greater possibility given your inherent virtues and abilities. In this, The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is unique. It will take you far beyond what is thought to be humanly possible. It will take you beyond human assumptions, beliefs, ideas, rituals and historical constraints. It is a rare and unique learning opportunity. It begins with what you know and develops your awareness and your perception, your ability to discern, your moral responsibilities, your sense of identity and your concern for your world and your race. It is here for humanity to enable humanity to keep pace with its own development and with the needs of the world. It is spiritual because it recognizes the presence and reality of a Greater Power in your life, not a greater extraterrestrial power but a greater Spiritual Power that is intrinsic to each of you and that you share together. You will need this Greater Power now, for you cannot make this advancement that we have indicated based purely on your human motivation alone. You need greater assistance, for you will need a greater mind, a greater will and a greater responsibility in order to meet the challenges in the future. For this, a Greater Power—the power of the Creator and the presence of Knowledge—is vital for your success.</p>
<p>对人类来说，更大的智慧是可能的，但为了让内识被接受，而不是被否认或反感，必须提出一个更大的现实——人类更大的需求，你们世界更大的需求，以及鉴于你固有的美德和能力，更大的可能性。在这一点上，大社区内识之路是独一无二的。它将使你远远超出人类所认为的可能。它将带你超越人类的假设、信仰、想法、仪式和历史限制。它是一个难得的、独特的学习机会。它从你所知道的开始，发展你的意识和感知，你的辨别能力，你的道德责任，你的身份感和你对世界和种族的关注。它是为人类而来，使人类能够跟上自己的发展和世界的需要。它是精神性的，因为它认识到在你的生命中存在着一种更大的力量和现实，不是一种更大的外星力量，而是一种更大的精神力量，是你们每个人固有的，是你们共同分享的。你现在将需要这种更伟大的力量，因为你不能仅仅依靠你人类的动机来取得我们所指出的这种进步。你需要更大的帮助，因为你将需要更大心智、更大的意志和更大的责任，以迎接未来的挑战。为此，一种更伟大的力量——造物主的力量和内识的存在——对你的成功至关重要。</p>
<p>The emphasis of this spirituality is not to take you away from the world. It is to enable you to be in the world. Its emphasis is not for you to make everything look sweet and lovely. It is to enable you to serve a world in need. Your concern is the world. What goes on in other worlds at this point is not your concern, but the fact that you are part of a Greater Community represents the larger context from which you can see yourself far more clearly and from which you can discern your responsibilities and the needs of the world.</p>
<p>这种精神的重点不是让你远离这个世界。它是为了使你能够在这个世界上存在。它的重点不是让你使一切看起来甜蜜可爱。它是为了使你能够为一个需要的世界服务。你关注的是这个世界。在这一点上，其他世界发生的事情与你无关，但你是大社区的一部分这一事实代表了更大的背景，从这里你可以更清楚地看到你自己，从这里你可以辨别你的责任和世界的需要。</p>
<p>It is easier to see yourself looking from the outside in than from the inside out. For example, people think they are remarkably complex and idiosyncratic, but in reality they are not that complicated, and they are not that different from each other. Your differences are slight and are often environmentally conditioned. This is not to say that you are not wonderful and marvelous, because you are wonderful and marvelous. But do not think that you are inexplicable. To an intelligent observer, human behavior and human thinking are easily discernible. Other races are not dominated by human logic, so they do not depend upon it in order to make their evaluations. You may appear logical to yourself, but that may only mean that you appear foolish to an outside observer. Human beings behave in predictable ways, and this can be easily discerned, especially because you are surface dwellers and all of your activities are out on the surface. In the mental environment, your minds can be read and understood, for you have not yet developed the ability to shield your thoughts, which will be necessary in the future if you are ever to compete successfully with Greater Community forces. Spiritually speaking, you are still very tribal in your outlook. You are very conditioned by the past and by past traditions, many of which are far overshadowed and have no relevance in a Greater Community context.</p>
<p>从外部看自己比从内部看自己更容易。例如，人们认为自己非常复杂，特立独行，但实际上他们并不那么复杂，他们彼此之间也没有什么不同。你们的差异是轻微的，而且往往是环境条件造成的。这并不是说你们不精彩和了不起，因为你们很精彩和了不起。但不要认为你们是不可解释的。对一个聪明的观察者来说，人类的行为和人类的思维是很容易辨别的。其他种族不受人类逻辑的支配，因此他们不依赖人类逻辑来进行评估。你们可能觉得自己合乎逻辑，但这可能只意味着你在外来观察者中是愚蠢的。人类的行为是可以预测的，这一点很容易被辨别出来，特别是因为你们是表面居民，你们所有的活动都是在地面上。在心理环境中，你们的思想可以被阅读和理解，因为你们还没有发展出屏蔽心智的能力，如果你们要与大社区的力量成功竞争，这在未来是必要的。从精神上讲，你们的观点仍然非常部落化。你们被过去和过去的传统所制约，其中许多都被掩盖了，在大社区的背景下毫无意义。</p>
<p>So, you see, there is a tremendous opportunity and need for advancement. Not everyone has to become engaged in this preparation, but a significant number of people need to. The race is furthered by the actions of a relatively small percentage of the population, but everyone has to be able to go along with it. Do not wait until your environment begins to fail you. Do not wait until your food supply becomes threatened and begins to diminish. Do not wait until your nations are bankrupt from warfare and exploitation. Then the road to recovery will be very difficult and possibly too difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>所以，你看，有一个巨大的机会和进步的需要。不是每个人都必须参与这种准备工作，但相当多的人需要这样做。比赛是通过相对较小比例的人口的行动来推进的，但每个人都必须能够顺势而为。不要等到你的环境开始对你失望。不要等到你的食物供应受到威胁并开始减少。不要等到你的国家因战争和剥削而破产。那么恢复的道路将非常困难，可能太难实现。</p>
<p>We have emphasized that you were sent to the world to serve the world. Though people generally believe they are in the world to satisfy themselves, you were sent to the world to serve the world, the whole world. Even if you only work in one little place, you are here to serve the whole world. From a Greater Community perspective, you are all one people. From a Greater Community perspective, you are not seen as being American or Chinese or Brazilian or African. You are all seen as one people, you will all be treated as one people, and you are all accountable as one people. So, the more you can begin to behave as if you were part of one people, which you will naturally do as you grow strong with Knowledge, then things can get done here. Then greater responsibilities can be assumed and shared.</p>
<p>我们已经强调，你被派往世界，为世界服务。虽然人们普遍认为他们在这个世界上是为了满足自己，但你们被派到这个世界上是为了服务世界，整个世界。即使你只在一个小地方工作，你在这里是为了服务整个世界。从大社区的角度来看，你们都是一个民族。从大社区的角度来看，你们不被看作是美国人、中国人、巴西人或非洲人。你们都被视为一个人类，你们都会被当作一个人类来对待，你们也都要作为一个人类来承担责任。因此，你越能开始表现得像你是一个人类的一部分，当你在内识中成长为强者时，你自然会这样做，那么工作就能在这里完成。然后可以承担和分享更大的责任。</p>
<p>Greater Community reality is not a foreign reality. It is not something that is going on way over there, far beyond your interests and concerns. You are right in the middle of it! You are right in the middle of the Greater Community. It is here. Your isolation is over. No longer will you be left alone to do as you please. No longer will you have a safe autonomy. It is like a little village in the jungle that is being discovered by the outside world. It is forever changed and in some cases may not survive the experience. The world is like a little village that has been left all to itself for these many millennia and now it has been discovered, not for the first time of course, but the intervention here is permanent. It will not go away.</p>
<p>大社区的现实并不是一个遥远的、与你的利益和关切无关的外部现实。你们正处在其中！你们正处于大社区的中心。它就在这里。你们的孤立状态已经结束。你们将不再被单独留下做你们想做的事。你们不再会有安全的自主权。它就像丛林中的一个小村庄，正在被外界发现。它将永远被改变，在某些情况下可能无法在这种经历中生存下来。这个世界就像一个小村庄，在这几千年里一直都是独自一人，现在它被发现了，当然不是第一次，但这里的干预将是永久性的。它不会消失。</p>
<p>You are involved now. This is your life now. Its problems are great, but what it offers you is freedom from personal isolation. Your life offers you a chance to become a citizen of the world to serve the world. It offers you an escape from your own little preoccupations. In this, it offers you greatness because it is great. If problems are great, the solutions will be great, the actions will be great, and the individuals who undertake them will be great. Your race needs greatness now because of what it faces. It faces the need to repair its world and to unite its people. It faces competition from the Greater Community. And it faces a requirement to evolve spiritually and psychologically in order to become citizens of the world and to become one race, in order to participate in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>你们现在被卷入了。这是你现在的生活。它的问题很大，但它提供给你的是摆脱个人孤立的自由。你的生活为你提供了一个机会，让你成为世界公民，为世界服务。它为你提供了从你自己的小心思中逃离的机会。在这一点上，它为你提供了伟大，因为它是伟大的。如果问题是伟大的，解决方案将是伟大的，行动将是伟大的，而承担这些行动的个人将是伟大的。你的种族现在需要伟大，因为它面临着什么。它面临着修复其世界和团结其人民的需要。它面临着来自大社区的竞争。它还面临着在精神上和心理上进化的要求，以便成为世界公民，成为一个种族，以便参与大社区。</p>
<p>You are now part of the Greater Community. Congratulations! It has arrived. You have arrived. Though many, many people—even some experts amongst you—still think that the nearest life is billions and billions of miles away, it is right in your own back yard. You will see the effect and evidence of this old anthropocentric thinking all around you. People’s ideas of themselves and the world offer no place for other intelligent life to exist.</p>
<p>你现在是大社区的一部分。祝贺你！它已经到来。你已经到了。虽然还有很多人——甚至你们中的一些专家——仍然认为最近的生命在数十亿和数十亿英里之外，但它就在你们自家的后院里。你会看到这种古老的人类中心主义思维的影响和证据就在你周围。人们对自己和世界的想法没有为其他智慧生命提供存在的空间。</p>
<p>Human beings have never had to compete with other intelligent life. Human beings compete with each other, often destructively, but not with a totally different form of intelligent life. To learn to do this will make you strong and discerning and will expand greatly the boundaries of your awareness and your capability. If your motives are honest, pure and wholesome, then there is the possibility of achieving Wisdom for this race, or at least for many in this race. Yet, if your motive is conquest and domination, then you will fail in the Greater Community because those whom you choose to be your adversaries are far more advanced than you in both their awareness and their capabilities. Their mental and physical abilities will exceed yours.</p>
<p>人类从来没有与其他智慧生命竞争过。人类相互竞争，往往是破坏性的，但不是与完全不同形式的智慧生命竞争。学会这样做将使你变得强大和有洞察力，并将大大扩展你的意识和能力的界限。如果你的动机是诚实、纯粹和健康的，那么就有可能为这个种族，或至少为这个种族中的许多人实现智慧。然而，如果你的动机是征服和统治，那么你将在大社区中失败，因为那些你选择的对手在他们的意识和能力方面都比你先进得多。他们的心理和身体能力将超过你。</p>
<p>Your possibility for success rests in Knowledge, for another race can be technologically advanced and even have gained some skill in the mental environment, but that does not mean that they are strong with Knowledge. That is why we emphasize Knowledge, not only for your fulfillment and well-being in the world but also because it gives you a great foundation and the only real advantage you have in terms of competition in the mental environment.</p>
<p>你成功的可能性在于内识，因为另一个种族可能在技术上很先进，甚至在心理环境中获得了一些技能，但这并不意味着他们的内识很强。这就是为什么我们强调内识，不仅是为了你在这个世界上的成就和福祉，而且还因为它给你一个伟大的基础，是你在心理环境中竞争的唯一真正优势。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, warfare as you know it—which is one side destroying another—does occur but is rare because there are other more subtle and less destructive ways of accomplishing the same task. Make others think the way you want them to think. You can do this without firing a shot. Make others respond the way you want them to respond and you can control the outcome. Make others believe what you want them to believe and they are completely pliable. All of these are possible when there is no Knowledge. Without Knowledge, you are easily manipulated. Your behavior can be predicted, and you can be persuaded. Your beliefs, your ideals, your religions and your political conditions can all be used against you. Only when Knowledge is strong within you can you become immune from even Greater Community influences, for Knowledge is the only thing within you that cannot be manipulated or dominated. It is completely free in the physical universe, and that is why the more you are aligned with Knowledge and are in relationship with Knowledge, the more free and free from intervention you become.</p>
<p>在大社区中，你所知道的战争——即一方摧毁另一方——确实发生过，但很少，因为有其他更微妙、破坏性更小的方式来完成同样的任务。让别人按照你想要的方式思考。你可以不开一枪就做到这一点。让别人以你想要的方式做出反应，你可以控制结果。让别人相信你想让他们相信的事情，他们就完全可以顺从。当没有内识时，所有这些都是可能的。没有内识，你就很容易被操纵。你的行为可以被预测，你也可以被说服。你的信仰、你的理想、你的宗教和你的政治状况都可以被用来对付你。只有当内识在你内心强大时，你才能对大社区影响产生免疫力，因为内识是你内心唯一不能被操纵或支配的存在。它在物理宇宙中是完全自由的，这就是为什么你越是与内识保持一致，与内识保持关系，你就越自由，越不受干预。</p>
<p>Some people think that The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is a way to change human thinking, when in reality it is a way to liberate human thinking, for it emphasizes the only thing in you that is truly free, the only thing in you which has power and real self-determination.</p>
<p>有些人认为大社区内识之路是一种改变人类思维的方式，而实际上它是一种解放人类思维的方式，因为它强调你身上唯一真正自由的内识，你身上唯一有力量和真正自我决定的东西。</p>
<p>You live in a Greater Community reality. Embrace this reality. Learn of this reality. Become strong in Knowledge. Become a student of Knowledge. Move beyond tribal mentality. Become a citizen of the world. This is the promise, and this is the need for you now. In this, you have great support and true companions.</p>
<p>你生活在一个大社区的现实中。拥抱这个现实。学习这个现实。在内识中变得强大。成为内识的学生。超越部落的心态。成为世界的公民。这是承诺，也是你们现在的需要。在这一点上，你有巨大的支持和真实的同伴。</p>
