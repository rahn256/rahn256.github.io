<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 8, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年4月8日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything you say and everything you do represent you in the world. They represent what you think and what you value, what you are contemplating and what you are avoiding. Your actions speak very loudly, louder than your words. Here you are making a demonstration of what you value and what you feel you are every day, in a myriad of ways. This is your self-expression. Only a small part of it is conscious on your part. The rest you are not aware of. To a certain degree, you cannot be aware of it objectively until you are quite advanced because how can you observe yourself every moment of every day?</p>
<p>你说的每一句话和做的每一件事都代表你在这个世界上。它们代表了你的想法和你的价值，你在考虑什么，你在回避什么。你的行动说得非常响亮，比你的语言更响亮。在这里，你每天都在以无数的方式展示你的价值和你的感觉。这是你的自我表达。其中只有一小部分是你有意识的。其余的你没有意识到。在某种程度上，你不能客观地意识到它，直到你相当先进，因为你怎么能每时每刻都观察自己呢？</p>
<p>Even in your dreams you are expressing yourself. Though you may not see the physical evidence of this, in the mental environment you are producing an effect. The mental environment is stimulating you, and you are stimulating it, every moment of every day, whether you are awake or asleep. As you learn to become more aware of the mental environment, you will see this in effect, and it will open your eyes to the great interaction that occurs between human beings and between human beings and their environment. It is occurring at all times. Here, indeed, you are entering a larger arena of life. This arena will demonstrate a greater interaction and will reveal the influences that are producing it throughout the world.</p>
<p>甚至在你的梦中你也在表达你自己。虽然你可能看不到这个的物理证据，但在心理环境中，你正在产生一种影响。心理环境在刺激你，你也在刺激它，每时每刻都在刺激它，无论你是醒着还是睡着。当你学会更多地意识到心理环境时，你会看到这种效果，它将使你看到人类之间以及人类与环境之间发生的巨大互动。它在任何时候都在发生。在这里，确实，你们正在进入一个更广阔的生命竞争舞台。这个舞台将显示出更大的互动，并将揭示出在全世界产生互动的影响。</p>
<p>Becoming aware of the mental environment represents a necessary part of your education in learning to recognize and to receive the Greater Community. You will not be able to share language with intelligent life from beyond. Your values will be different; your behavior will be different; your physical appearance will be different; perhaps your motives will be very different. But in the mental environment you will be able to comprehend their self-expression. They are seeking to comprehend yours, even at this moment. So, the study of the mental environment is essential, not only for successful living in the world, but also to encounter intelligent life from beyond, which is a necessary part of your education as the world now prepares to emerge into a larger arena of life.</p>
<p>意识到心理环境代表了你在学习认识和接受大社区的教育中的一个必要部分。你们将无法与来自外界的智慧生命分享语言。你们的价值观将是不同的；你们的行为将是不同的；你们的身体外观将是不同的；也许你们的动机将是非常不同的。但在心理环境中，你将能够理解他们的自我表达。他们正在寻求理解你的，甚至在这一刻。因此，对心理环境的研究是必不可少的，不仅是为了成功地生活在这个世界上，而且也是为了遇到来自外部的智慧生命，这是你们教育的一个必要部分，因为现在的世界准备出现在一个更广阔的生命竞争舞台上。</p>
<p>Therefore, when you consider your self-expression, consider it in a very complete sense. And remember, you are only aware of a small percentage of what you are communicating to the world around you. Perhaps those things you want to say or intend to say and want to do or intend to do represent this small percentage of your overall self-expression. Your self-expression has a great impact on your relationships with other people and will determine in large measure how they perceive you and how they respond to you as well.</p>
<p>因此，当你考虑你的自我表达时，要在一个非常完整的意义上考虑它。并记住，你只意识到你向周围世界传达的一小部分内容。也许那些你想说或打算说、想做或打算做的事情代表了你整体自我表达的这一小部分。你的自我表达对你与其他人的关系有很大影响，将在很大程度上决定他们如何看待你，以及他们如何回应你。</p>
<p>Becoming aware of your thinking and behavior leads you to become aware of your self-expression in the world and opens many new avenues for this expression to be given in a conscious way rather than demonstrated automatically. Here there are real breakthroughs in learning, for here people realize they can have a much greater impact upon the world than they had previously considered. They realize they can have a much greater impact upon their relationships. This affirms their power and the opportunities for this power to be expressed constructively. This is a large part of the greater education which is being presented in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Like all forms of great education, it has many stages of development, many thresholds of learning and many opportunities to gain new insights and to re-evaluate old ones.</p>
<p>意识到你的思维和行为，你就会意识到你在这个世界上的自我表达，并为这种表达开辟了许多新的途径，使之以有意识的方式而不是自动展示。在这里，学习有了真正的突破，因为人们在这里意识到他们可以对世界产生比他们以前所考虑的更大的影响。他们意识到他们可以对自己的关系产生更大的影响。这肯定了他们的力量和这种力量被建设性地表达的机会。这是大社区内识之路中提出的大教育的一大部分。像所有形式的伟大教育一样，它有许多发展阶段，许多学习的门槛，许多获得新见解和重新评估旧见解的机会。</p>
<p>You are expressing yourself continuously. Your thoughts are affecting the mental environment, and your actions are affecting the physical environment. You live in both environments. They co-exist together. You are becoming more aware of your physical environment, but the mental environment is still a great mystery to you. Everyone else is living in these environments as well, and they too are expressing themselves every moment of every day. The interaction between human beings, then, becomes quite complex. It is complex because people are unaware of their self-expression. They interact with each other, but then they have their interpretations of the interaction, which can be quite different from the interaction itself. When you are unaware of something, you make judgments in order to give yourself explanations upon which you build your assumptions about life and your sense of self.</p>
<p>你在不断地表达自己。你的思维在影响心理环境，你的行为在影响物理环境。你生活在两种环境中。它们一起共存。你越来越意识到你的物理环境，但心理环境对你来说仍是一个巨大的谜。其他人也都生活在这些环境中，他们也每时每刻都在表达自己。那么，人与人之间的互动就变得相当复杂。它之所以复杂，是因为人们没有意识到他们的自我表达。他们彼此互动，但他们对互动有自己的解释，这可能与互动本身有很大不同。当你不知道某件事情时，你会做出判断，以便给自己解释，在此基础上建立你对生命和自我感觉的假设。</p>
<p>This complexity between human beings is not natural. In other words, it is not meant to be that way. It is complicated by the fact that people are unaware of their self-expression and because they are unaware of their self-expression, they base their actions and thinking upon assumptions, which may have little to do with reality as it is occurring moment to moment. This is what makes things complex between people.</p>
<p>人与人之间的这种复杂性并非自然形成的。换句话说，关系本不应如此复杂。复杂性的产生是因为人们对自我表达缺乏意识，正因为他们对自我表达缺乏意识，所以他们的行动和思维基于假设，而这些假设可能与现实中每时每刻发生的事情没有什么关系。这就是使人与人之间的关系变得复杂的原因。</p>
<p>Indeed, if you think about this and consider it, it may seem hopelessly complex. How can one gain a real experience of self-expression and the interaction with other human beings without being governed by personal fear or personal preference, by judgments and beliefs? How can one have a real and direct experience that is not colored by these things or distorted by them? Indeed, because people are so minimally aware of the mental environment in which they live and have such little recognition of their self-expression, this problem can seem enormous and the solution can seem far in the future, if it is possible to accomplish at all.</p>
<p>确实，如果你仔细思考并考虑这一点，可能会觉得复杂得无可救药。一个人如何能够在不受个人恐惧或个人偏好、判断和信念支配的情况下获得真实的自我表达体验和与他人的互动？一个人如何能够拥有不受这些因素影响或扭曲的真实和直接的体验？确实，由于人们对自己所处的心理环境缺乏意识，对自我表达的认识也非常有限，这个问题看起来可能十分巨大，而解决方案似乎遥不可及，甚至无法实现。</p>
<p>The answer to a hopeless question is to appeal to a Greater Power, to abide with the Greater Power and to learn from the Greater Power. The Greater Power is within you. It is with you now. It is not far away; it is not a great god on a great throne who is so distant and so grand that you cannot approach it. The power is given you in the power of Knowledge that you possess. Following Knowledge engages you in real interaction between people, teaches you the subtle forms of communication that are occurring and brings you into an awareness of your own behavior and thinking so that you can come to realize what your self-expression is, what it is expressing and the avenues in which it renders its communication most effectively.</p>
<p>对于一个无望的问题，答案是向更大的力量呼唤，与更大的力量共处，并向更大的力量学习。伟大的力量就在你心里。它现在就在你身边。它并不遥远；它不是一个伟大的上帝，在一个伟大的宝座上，他是如此遥远，如此伟大，以至于你无法接近它。这种力量是在你拥有的内识的力量中给予你的。追随内识让你参与人与人之间的真实互动，教你发生的微妙的沟通形式，让你意识到自己的行为和思维，这样你就能认识到你的自我表达是什么，它在表达什么，以及它最有效的沟通途径。</p>
<p>Following Knowledge also teaches you how others respond to you and how you respond to them. It gives you this view and this understanding because it reveals what is happening, without interpretation. It simply brings into your awareness the dynamics of your interaction with other people. The opportunities for success here and the benefits that can be derived from it are so vast and so great that you cannot imagine the impact this will have on your relationships and on your sense of well-being. Beyond learning this, there are essential skills to cultivate over time in order to enable you to engage with the Greater Community Forces that are in the world at this time and who will be part of your life in the future in an increasing way.</p>
<p>遵循内识也教你他人如何回应你，你如何回应他们。它给你这种观点和理解，因为它揭示了正在发生的关系，没有解释。它只是将你与他人互动的动态带入你的意识中。在这里，成功的机会和可以得到的好处是如此巨大，以至于你无法想象这将对你的关系和你的幸福感产生的影响。除了学习这些，还有一些必要的技能需要长期培养，以使你能够与此时在世界上的大社区力量打交道，他们将在未来以越来越多的方式成为你生命的一部分。</p>
<p>What you think and what you do are guided by what you value and by what you feel is essential. Therefore, to learn of your self-expression you must learn what these things mean for you. Here, in order to begin to develop a truly objective view of yourself, you must first recognize the way you want to see yourself, the way you want to see the world and the way you want to see other people. Here you must face your pain and error, not to condemn yourself but with the desire to see and to understand. Here you learn to view others with this greater objectivity, not to condemn them but to see and to understand.</p>
<p>你所想的和你所做的都是由你的价值和你觉得必要的东西所引导的。因此，要学习你的自我表达，你必须了解这些东西对你意味着什么。在这里，为了开始对自己形成一个真正客观的看法，你必须首先认识到你想看自己的方式，你想看世界的方式和你想看别人的方式。在这里，你必须面对你的痛苦和错误，不是为了谴责自己，而是带着看和理解的渴望。在这里，你要学会用这种更大的客观性来看待他人，不是谴责他们，而是要看见和理解。</p>
<p>The ability to gain this objectivity and this self-awareness comes by following the means that are provided in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, for you cannot teach yourself these skills. You cannot lift yourself up. You must engage your personal mind in specific forms of education that enable it to come into harmony with your greater life and your greater mind, which are represented by your Knowledge.</p>
<p>获得这种客观性和自我意识的能力是通过遵循大社区内识之路中提供的方法来实现的，因为你无法教自己这些技能。你不能把自己抬起来。你必须让你的个人心智参与特定形式的教育，使它能够与你的更大的生命和更大的心智和谐相处，这些都是由你的内识代表的。</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer to how this can be done is to follow a means of preparation. How could there be any other kind of answer? Even if I said, “Do this,” and “Do that,” it would seem beyond your reach. The requirements would seem too great. That is why you need a slow and progressive form of development. Your learning is always conditioned by your desire for it and your capacity for it. You can increase your desire intentionally, but your capacity must be increased over time through progressive levels of learning and reintegration. You cannot simply expand your capacity because you want to have it expanded. This takes time and preparation. The desire to learn must have your increasing willingness and intention to explore, to discover and to understand. And it must be accompanied by tremendous perseverance and patience in order for your capacity for learning to be recognized as it exists now and then for it to be slowly and safely expanded.</p>
<p>因此，如何做到这一点的答案是遵循一种准备的手段。怎么会有其他类型的答案呢？即使我说，”做这个”和”做那个”，这似乎也是你无法做到的。这些要求似乎太大。这就是为什么你需要一个缓慢和渐进的发展形式。你的学习总是受你对它的渴望和你的能力所制约。你可以有意识地增加你的渴望，但你的能力必须通过渐进的学习和重新整合的水平来增加。你不能简单地扩大你的能力，因为你想让它扩大。这需要时间和准备。学习的渴望必须有你越来越多的意愿和意图来探索、发现和理解。它必须伴随着极大的毅力和耐心，以使你的学习能力在目前存在的情况下得到承认，然后缓慢而安全地扩大。</p>
<p>Let me give an example. If all of a sudden you became aware of all of the communication that is occurring in the mental environment around you, you would likely go insane. It would be too much stimulation for you. It would be too confusing. You would not be able to escape from it. This awareness would be very damaging to you because you do not yet have the capacity to participate in this communication consciously or to understand it or to integrate its meaning. This requires a very developed mind to be able to do this—a mind that is capable of experiencing prolonged periods of stillness and observation without judgment, a mind that is not driven by ambition and desire, a mind that can be calm and observant, a mind that can wait for answers to emerge rather than inventing them for its own self-satisfaction or sense of security. You do not have this mind currently, though it is possible for you to attain it over time.</p>
<p>让我举个例子。如果突然间你意识到在你周围的心理环境中发生的所有交流，你很可能会疯掉。对你来说，这将是太多的刺激。它将是如此的混乱。你将无法从中逃脱。这种意识会对你造成很大的伤害，因为你还没有能力有意识地参与这种交流，也没有能力理解它或整合它的意义。这需要一个非常发达的心智才能做到这一点——一个能够经历长时间的静心和观察而不做判断的心智，一个不受野心和欲望驱使的心智，一个能够冷静和观察的心智，一个能够等待答案出现而不是为了自己的自我满足或安全感而发明答案的心智。你目前还没有这种心智，尽管随着时间的推移，你有可能达到这种心智。</p>
<p>Therefore, you cannot leap into a state of so-called “super-consciousness” without destroying your ability to interact with yourself, with others and with the world. Once you realize that you have limits and that these limits should not be transgressed, then you will appreciate the preparation that has been given to you. You will accept the fact that it takes a good deal of time. And you will feel more confident and secure knowing that you can proceed slowly and carefully without sending yourself into great discord or upheaval or producing an instability that you yourself could not arrest.</p>
<p>因此，你不可能在不破坏你与自己、与他人和与世界互动的能力的情况下跃升到所谓的”超级意识”状态。一旦你意识到你有局限性，而且这些局限性不应该被超越，那么你就会感激已经给你的准备。你会接受它需要大量时间的事实。而且你会感到更有信心和安全感，因为你知道你可以慢慢地、小心地进行，而不会让自己陷入巨大的不和谐或动荡，或产生你自己无法阻止的不稳定。</p>
<p>Learning about your self-expression is a natural by-product of learning what you know and how you interact with the world. It is taking full account of your mind. It is taking full account of your experience. It is taking full account of the experiences of those who are having a direct influence upon you. This is not acquired instantaneously or by taking a few simple steps. This, indeed, is having an entirely new experience of yourself and the world around you. With this comes a tremendous sense of power because you realize that you are an influence in the world rather than someone who is just being influenced. You are having an impact upon the world.</p>
<p>学习你的自我表达是学习你所知道的以及你如何与世界互动的一个自然副产品。它是充分考虑到你的心灵。它是充分考虑到你的经历。它是充分考虑到那些对你有直接影响的人的经验。这不是即时获得的，也不是通过几个简单的步骤获得的。事实上，这是对你自己和你周围的世界有一个全新的经验。随之而来的是一种巨大的力量感，因为你意识到你是这个世界上的一个影响者，而不是一个只能被影响的人。你正在对世界产生影响。</p>
<p>With this power comes the great requirement for responsibility. Without this responsibility, your power would be damaging to you and to the world. It would be used to fulfill your ambitions, to fortify your needs and to amplify your fears. The responsibility here is that you realize you have a contribution to make to the world. You realize you are committed to following a Higher Power in order to learn of this contribution and how it can be carried, wisely expressed and made manifest within your life. Patience, perseverance, stillness, objectivity, observation, the willingness to learn, the willingness to revise your beliefs, the willingness to overturn former assumptions, the willingness not to know, the willingness to be confused, the willingness to take charge when that is necessary and the willingness to step back and yield to others when that is necessary—all these things must accompany your development.</p>
<p>有了这种力量，就有了对责任的巨大要求。如果没有这种责任，你的力量就会对你和世界造成损害。它将被用来实现你的野心，强化你的需求，放大你的恐惧。这里的责任是，你意识到你对世界有贡献。你意识到你致力于追随一个更高的力量，以便认识这种贡献，以及如何在你的生命中进行、明智地表达和体现。耐心、毅力、静心、客观、观察、愿意学习、愿意修正你的信仰、愿意推翻以前的假设、愿意不知道、愿意被迷惑、愿意在必要时负责、愿意在必要时退后并让位于他人——所有这些都必须伴随你的发展。</p>
<p>It is not expected that you will have this willingness at the outset. Of course you won’t. But it is essential that you accept it as you proceed along. Then, you will have an opportunity to understand the power of your thinking, the power of other people’s thinking and the incredible interaction that occurs between you and others. You will also have an opportunity to learn that you have a certain protected mental space, a protected mental position in life. Unless you yield yourself inappropriately, others cannot penetrate this. You could call it your personal space or location.</p>
<p>我们并不期望你在一开始就有这种意愿。当然你不会。但是在你前进的过程中，你必须接受它。然后，你将有机会理解你的思维的力量、其他人的思维的力量以及你和其他人之间发生的不可思议的互动。你也将有机会学习到，你有一定的受保护的心理空间，在生命中有一个受保护的心理位置。除非你不适当地屈服于自身，否则别人无法穿透这个心理空间。你可以称它为你的个人空间或个人位置。</p>
<p>What is inviolable within you is your Knowledge. Your personal mind can be influenced, dominated, persuaded, overtaken, tricked, commanded, and so forth. So, when we talk about something that cannot be violated within you, we are speaking of Knowledge. It is the only truly safe place you have.</p>
<p>你内心不可侵犯的是你的内识。你的个人心智可以被影响、被支配、被说服、被超越、被欺骗、被命令，等等。因此，当我们谈到你内在不能被侵犯的东西时，我们说的是内识。它是你唯一真正安全的地方。</p>
<p>When you begin to learn about the mental environment, you will see how conditioned you are by the things that you accept, the things that you think, the ideas you share with others, the impact you allow others to have upon you, the weakness you have in attempting to acquire things from the world, your vulnerability, and so forth. Indeed, if you are developing and undertaking any kind of psychological re-evaluation of yourself, you must come to terms with how conditioned you are. This is a difficult part of the preparation process because here you discover your weakness and your vulnerability. Yet, you must proceed beyond this discovery to realize your strength. Otherwise, you can become discouraged and as a result decide to live in greater self-protection and isolation, sealing yourself off from everyone and everything out of fear that they will overtake you or dominate you. This is, perhaps, an understandable reaction to the discovery of your own vulnerability, but it does not lead to Wisdom and will engender misery for you and for others who have come to serve and assist you. You must go beyond this.</p>
<p>当你开始学习心理环境时，你会看到你接受的东西、你思考的东西、你与他人分享的想法、你允许他人对你产生的影响、你试图从世界上获得的东西的弱点、你的脆弱性等等是多么的受限。事实上，如果你正在发展并对自己进行任何一种心理上的重新评估，你必须接受你是如何被制约的。这是准备过程中的一个困难部分，因为在这里你发现了你的弱点和你的脆弱性。然而，你必须超越这种发现，意识到自己的力量。否则，你可能会感到气馁，并因此决定生活在更强的自我保护和孤立中，从而由于害怕他人会超越你或支配你而将自己与所有人和一切事物隔离开来。这或许是对发现自己脆弱性的一个可以理解的反应，但这不会通向智慧，反而会为你以及那些前来服务和帮助你的人带来痛苦。因此，你必须超越这一点。</p>
<p>The mental environment is the environment in which you think. The physical environment is the environment in which you act. The physical influences the mental, but the mental influences the physical to a greater degree. Unless the physical environment is directly infringing itself upon you or controlling your actions or behavior, the influence of the mental environment on you is greater and more consistent. Therefore, the greater your awareness and understanding of your own mental condition and how others influence you and how you influence them, the greater the impact you can have intentionally upon the world.</p>
<p>心理环境是你思考的环境。物理环境是你行动的环境。身体影响着心理，但心理在更大程度上影响着身体。除非物理环境直接侵犯你，或控制你的行动或行为，否则心理环境对你的影响更大，更一致。因此，你对自己的心理状况以及他人如何影响你和你如何影响他人的认识和理解越深，你对世界有意产生的影响就越大。</p>
<p>Here your mind will become much more concentrated than others, which will give you power, for power is concentration of mind. This concentration can be for good or for ill, but it will exert a greater influence to the degree to which it is concentrated. The person who thinks only of a few things that draw all of his or her emotional intensity will exert a greater influence on the mental environment than someone who casually believes in something or considers something only periodically. The person who has a deep conviction and a deep sense of belief will exert a greater influence than someone who is only entertaining or considering an idea. People with conviction will be able to do far more and will have much greater impact in the world. They will be able to influence other minds. This does not mean that what they believe in or are convinced of is necessarily good, for power is neutral. Power used for good and power used for ill represents concentration of mind. Therefore, for you to have a greater influence upon the world, which is necessary if you wish to make a contribution to the world, you must understand your mental resources and the influences that affect them every day.</p>
<p>在这里，你的心智将变得比别人更集中，这将给你带来力量，因为力量就是心灵的集中。这种集中可以是好的，也可以是坏的，但它会在集中的程度上发挥更大的影响。只想到几件事情的人，吸引了他或她所有的情感强度，将对心理环境产生更大的影响，而不是随便相信什么或只是定期考虑什么的人。有深刻的信念和信仰感的人，会比只对某个想法进行娱乐或考虑的人发挥更大的影响力。有信念的人将能做得更多，对世界的影响也更大。他们将能够影响其他的心智，这并不意味着他们所相信或确信的东西一定是好的，因为力量是中性的。用来做好事的力量和用来做坏事的力量代表心灵的集中。因此，为了使你对世界有更大的影响，如果你想对世界做出贡献，这是必要的，你必须理解你的心理资源和每天影响它们的影响因素。</p>
<p>To give you an example of what this might look like, I will speak of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge here because it emphasizes development in the mental environment to a very large degree. In a Greater Community context, development in the mental environment is essential for success, for in the future you will be dealing with intelligences that are far more concentrated than you are and have a much greater perspective, having lived with a much broader viewpoint and experience. A more concentrated mind will exert a greater influence upon you than you will upon it. In order for you to engage successfully with a Greater Community intelligence, not only to comprehend it but to offset its influence, you must have a much greater concentration of mind.</p>
<p>为了给你举个例子，我在这里说的是大社区内识之路，因为它在很大程度上强调了心理环境的发展。在大社区的背景下，心理环境的发展对成功至关重要，因为在未来，你将与比你更集中的智慧生命打交道，他们有更大的视野，有更广泛的观点和经历。一个更集中的心智对你的影响会比你对它的影响更大。为了让你成功地与大社区的智慧打交道，不仅要理解它，而且要抵消它的影响，你必须有一个更集中的心灵。</p>
<p>People who undertake the reclamation of Knowledge often find themselves withdrawing from life in certain ways in order to minimize or limit the influences of society upon them. This gives them the freedom to re-evaluate themselves without feeling bombarded by the world’s influences and images. This is why many people who begin to study The Greater Community Way of Knowledge seek escape from television, radio and even music—not because these things are inherently bad but because they are so influential. They withdraw from individuals who influence them in ways that are counterproductive to their well-being and to their ability to refocus their mind. This withdrawal is necessary for people to rethink their thoughts, to have the freedom of evaluation, to gain control of their own mental forces, to deepen their awareness of themselves and to become more sensitive to the things that are influencing them.</p>
<p>进行内识开垦的人经常发现自己以某种方式退出生活，以减少或限制社会对他们的影响。这让他们有了重新评价自己的自由，而不会感到被世界的影响和形象所轰炸。这就是为什么许多开始学习大社区内识之路的人寻求逃离电视、广播甚至音乐——不是因为这些东西本身不好，而是因为它们的影响太大。他们从那些对他们产生影响的人那里退出来，这些人对他们的幸福和他们重新集中注意力的能力产生了反作用。这种退出对于人们重新思考自己的思想、拥有评价的自由、获得对自己心理力量的控制、加深对自身的认识以及对影响他们的事物变得更加敏感是必要的。</p>
<p>Now, there are gross influences and there are subtle influences. Initially, in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge people will want to withdraw from the gross influences. This will enable them to develop the sensitivity to comprehend and effectively engage with the subtle influences. Subtle influences include the thoughts of other people who are not in your immediate environment but with whom you are in relationship. Subtle influences include the presence of extraterrestrial life that may be in your vicinity. Perhaps this extraterrestrial presence is not affecting you directly or focusing on you at all, but its presence will exert a certain influence upon you. This influence is subtle, but this does not mean that it has no power or does not affect you.</p>
<p>现在，有粗暴的影响，也有微妙的影响。最初，在大社区内识之路中，人们会希望从粗暴的影响中退出。这将使他们能够发展敏感度，理解并有效地参与微妙的影响。微妙的影响包括不在你周围环境中但与你有关系的其他人的思维。微妙的影响包括可能在你附近的地球之外生命的存在。也许这种地球之外的生命的存在根本没有直接影响你或关注你，但它的存在会对你产生某种影响。这种影响是微妙的，但这并不意味着它没有力量或不影响你。</p>
<p>Indeed, many of your depressing moods have nothing to do with you at all. Many of them are the result of you engaging with something in the mental environment that you are not aware of. Often it is something that is not even in your visual range. Here people can go through tremendous mood swings frequently, being affected by things that are not even part of their own lives. In other cases, their own thinking is governing their emotional responses to a very great degree. Yet, often people who are engaged in therapeutic processes make the mistake of thinking that all of their experiences are determined by their own conditioning, their own thinking and their own activities. This false assumption is made because people think they are isolated in life. They are not aware of the mental environment.</p>
<p>确实，你许多沮丧情绪与你本人无关。很多时候，这些情绪是你在意识不到的心理环境中与某些事物交互的结果。通常情况下，这些事物甚至不在你的视觉范围内。在这里，人们经常会经历巨大的情绪波动，受到那些甚至不是他们自己生活一部分的事物的影响。在其他情况下，他们自己的思维方式在很大程度上决定了他们的情绪反应。然而，很多参与治疗过程的人常常犯了一个错误，认为他们所有的经历都是由他们自己的条件、思维和活动决定的。这种错误的假设是因为人们认为他们在生活中是孤立的。他们没有意识到心理环境的存在。</p>
<p>The mental environment is like living in a sea of consciousness. You are swimming in a great ocean of consciousness. When I say consciousness, it does not mean that it is self-conscious. It simply means that it is actively thinking. Active thinking is not necessarily conscious thinking. The mind is working all the time, whether you are aware of it or not. It is exerting an influence and being influenced all the time, whether you are aware of it or not. Gaining awareness of the mind, controlling its influence on others and controlling what influences it, or at least determining how much this influence can affect you, represents achievement and advancement in education. The result of this will give you greater empowerment, greater certainty and the ability to affect, nurture and support others in ways that are effective and appropriate for them. This is a very great achievement.</p>
<p>心理环境就像生活在意识的海洋中。你是在一个巨大的意识海洋中游泳。当我说意识时，这并不意味着它是自我意识的。它只是意味着它在积极思考。积极思考不一定是有意识的思考。心灵一直在工作，无论你是否意识到它。无论你是否意识到，它一直在施加影响和被影响。获得对心灵的认识，控制它对他人的影响，控制影响它的因素，或者至少确定这种影响对你的程度，代表着教育的成就和进步。这样做的结果会给你更大的力量，更大的确定性，并有能力以有效和适合他人的方式影响、培养和支持他人。这是一个非常伟大的成就。</p>
<p>If you look about in the world, you will see that many people feel that they are the victims of life, that life is controlling them, that they have no power to change it, that it is too big for them. This is so common. You can see it everywhere. You can hear it in so many conversations. It is demonstrated in people’s activities. It is demonstrated in their forms of escape, which are often destructive. It is demonstrated in the ineffectiveness that people feel in meeting real problems in the world. It is omnipresent. Why is this?</p>
<p>如果你看看这个世界，你会发现许多人觉得他们是生命的受害者，生命在控制他们，他们没有能力改变它，生命对他们来说太大了。这是很常见的。你可以到处看到它。你可以在许多谈话中听到它。它表现在人们的活动中。它表现在他们的逃避方式上，而这些方式往往是破坏性的。它表现在人们在解决世界上的实际问题时感到无能为力。它是无处不在的。为什么会这样？</p>
<p>If your experience of being influenced is greater than your experience of influencing others, clearly you are not aware of the mental environment and do not have an awareness of your own thinking and its impact upon others. Indeed, the prevalent belief that people are governed by circumstances and are totally conditioned by them is reinforced by the people who believe in it, and so this belief becomes stronger and seemingly more impermeable. Thus, unconsciousness fortifies itself. You fortify anything you believe in. You add to it. Anything you value you fortify. If you value truth, you add to truth in the world. If you value the escape from truth, you add to the escape from truth in the world. The mental environment you live in, the human mental environment, is a result of all of this put together.</p>
<p>如果你被影响的经验大于你影响他人的经验，显然你没有意识到心理环境，没有意识到自己的思维及其对他人的影响。事实上，人们普遍认为人受环境支配，完全受环境制约，这种信仰被相信它的人强化了，于是这种信仰变得更加牢固，似乎更加不可渗透。因此，无意识强化了自己。你强化了你所相信的任何事物。你为它添加。任何你重视的事物，你都会强化它。如果你重视真理，你就在这个世界上增加了真理。如果你重视对真理的逃避，你就会在这个世界上增加对真理的逃避。你所生活的心理环境，人类的心理环境，是所有这些加在一起的结果。</p>
<p>Here you can begin to understand why the Wise withdraw so completely from the influences of the world. They realize that the mental environment in which they live will dominate them unless they take great and significant steps in insulating themselves from it. They have also learned over time that they can influence the mental environment of the world through the forms of spiritual practice that they have learned and that they reinforce. They withdraw from the gross influences to a very great degree. Then they are able to discern the subtle influences, and they are able to establish their own foundation and then contribute from this foundation. If they are wise, they do this without condemnation because when you condemn something, you enter into relationship with it. Your condemnation bonds you to it. Condemn evil and you will be bonded to evil. Condemn a form of ignorance and you will be bonded to it. If you do not want to be bonded to those influences that are holding you back or clouding your vision or disabling you from gaining access to your own inner resources, then do not use condemnation.</p>
<p>在这里你可以开始理解为什么智者会如此彻底地从世界的影响中退出。他们意识到，除非他们采取重大措施使自己与之隔绝，否则他们所处的心理环境将支配他们。随着时间的推移，他们也了解到，他们可以通过他们所学到的精神实践形式来影响世界的心理环境，并且他们会加强这种实践。他们在很大程度上退出了粗暴的影响。然后他们能够辨别微妙的影响，他们能够建立自己的基础，然后从这个基础上作出贡献。如果他们是明智的，他们在做这件事的时候没有谴责，因为当你谴责某个东西的时候，你就和它建立了关系。你的谴责将你与它联系在一起。谴责邪恶，你就会与邪恶联系在一起。谴责一种无知的形式，你就会与它结合在一起。如果你不想与那些阻碍你、蒙蔽你的视野或使你无法获得你自己的内在资源的影响相联系，那么就不要使用谴责。</p>
<p>Emotion, whether it be love or hate or avoidance, always bonds you to the thing you are responding to. If you hate another person, hate will bond you to that person. If you love a person, love will bond you to that person. Love is the preferred bond, but in many cases you may not want to be bonded to the person at all. That is why condemnation is so inappropriate. Condemnation also disables you from gaining access to what you know, so it has a double liability. It bonds you to that from which you are trying to separate yourself, and it clouds your vision and disables you from gaining access to what you know. It is not only for moral reasons that we say, “Do not condemn others.” It is for practical reasons as well because it creates injury and harm and prevents your progress. Therefore, it is for practical reasons that this must be discouraged.</p>
<p>情感，不管是爱还是恨还是回避，总是把你和你所回应的事物联系在一起。如果你恨另一个人，恨会把你和那个人联系在一起。如果你爱一个人，爱就会把你和那个人联系起来。爱是首选的纽带，但在许多情况下，你可能根本不想与这个人结合。这就是为什么谴责是如此不合适。谴责也使你无法获得你所知道的内识，所以它有双重责任。它把你和你试图与之分离的东西联系在一起，而且它遮蔽了你的视野，使你无法获得你所知道的内识。我们说”不要谴责他人”不仅是出于道德原因。这也是出于实际的原因，因为它造成了伤害和损害，阻碍了你的进步。因此，正是出于实际原因，必须阻止这种做法。</p>
<p>So, you see, self-expression isn’t simply what you say and how well you say it. It isn’t only what you do and how well you do it. It is your entire being in the world. Consider this: A man and woman of Knowledge may do very little in the world. They may have a very simple job. Their activities may not be magnanimous or unique. Ah, but what an influence they will cast. Others will feel renewed and replenished being in their presence. Yet, others will avoid them because they cannot tolerate this influence. The man or woman of Knowledge who is developed and prepared will cast, in most cases, a greater influence upon the environment than the environment can cast upon them. Indeed, they create their own environment. They do not do this by furnishing their house and putting up pretty wallpaper. They create an environment mentally. They create their own mental environment.</p>
<p>所以，你看，自我表达不只是你说什么和你说得多好。它不仅仅是你做什么和你做得多好。它是你在这个世界上的全部存在。考虑一下这个。一个有内识的男人和女人在这个世界上可能做得很少。他们可能有一个非常简单的工作。他们的活动可能不是宽宏大量或独特的。啊，但他们会产生多么大的影响。其他人在他们面前会感到焕然一新，得到充实。然而，其他人会避开他们，因为他们不能容忍这种影响。在大多数情况下，有内识的男人或女人，他们对环境的影响比环境对他们的影响更大。事实上，他们创造自己的环境。他们不是通过布置房子和贴上漂亮的墙纸来做到这一点。他们在心理上创造了一个环境。他们创造自己的心理环境。</p>
<p>In order for you to create your own mental environment, you must withdraw from the world and the gross influences of the world, at least for a period of time. Then, with as much objectivity as possible, you must come to learn of the subtle influences which affect you. This is not easy to do. You must prepare according to The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. You must cultivate yourself—your mental abilities, your awareness, your discernment and your discretion. You must separate yourself from people who cannot help you in this, even if they love you. You must engage with those few individuals who will play a part in your advancement. You must take risks.</p>
<p>为了让你创造自己的心理环境，你必须从世界和世界的粗暴影响中退出，至少在一段时间内。然后，你必须尽可能客观地学习影响你的微妙影响。这是不容易做到的。你必须按照大社区内识之路进行准备。你必须培养自己——你的心理能力、你的意识、你的辨别力和你的谨慎。你必须把自己与那些在这方面不能帮助你的人分开，即使他们爱你。你必须与那些将在你的进步中发挥作用的少数人接触。你必须承担风险。</p>
<p>You must develop the necessary approach. Then you can begin to establish your own mental environment. You still will have to protect it in the world because your mental environment is less powerful than the combined mental environment of everyone else. But as your mental environment becomes more formed and more established within you, it will begin to exert an influence upon others naturally. Here you will not have to determine the influence at every moment, for the more you are engaged with Knowledge, the more Knowledge can flow through you and speak through you. Its essence can surround you. Here you become a witness to your own influence upon others. You do not dominate, you do not command and you do not overtake others. You simply share with them that which you have discovered.</p>
<p>你必须发展必要的方法。然后你可以开始建立你自己的心理环境。你仍然要在这个世界上保护它，因为你的心理环境比其他人的综合心理环境的力量要小。但是，随着你的心理环境在你内在的形成和确立，它将开始自然地对其他人施加影响。在这里，你不必每时每刻都确定这种影响，因为你越是与内识打交道，内识就越能流经你，通过你说话。它的本质可以围绕着你。在这里，你成为你自己对他人影响的见证。你不主宰，不指挥，不超越他人。你只是与他们分享你所发现的内识。</p>
<p>In relationship with anyone, you can only share that which you have discovered. The relationship can only demonstrate what you and another value and what you have discovered. It can also demonstrate conflict between you and another. Essentially, it cannot go further than you have gone yourself. That is why it is not appropriate to be in relationship with people all the time, particularly primary relationships. That is actually a rare thing, though people try to have it all the time.</p>
<p>在与任何人的关系中，你只能分享你所发现的内识。这种关系只能证明你和另一个人的价值和你所发现的内识。它也可以展示你和另一个人之间的冲突。基本上，它不能比你自己走得更远。这就是为什么一直与人发生关系是不合适的，特别是初级关系。这实际上是一件罕见的事情，尽管人们试图一直拥有它。</p>
<p>You need time alone; you need the assistance of one or two people; you need an appropriate form of development and curriculum for development. Then you can begin to develop your own mental environment, an environment that can co-exist with life and cast an influence upon it. Very few people have been able to do this, so you do not have many models for success. Perhaps you will need to have faith in what I am telling you. If you look around, you can see that everyone seems to be overtaken by the world. In fact, you might not know anyone who has gained any real independence from the influences that are governing everyone. The demonstrations of this are rare, but very significant.</p>
<p>你需要独处的时间；你需要一两个人的协助；你需要一个适当的发展形式和发展课程。然后你就可以开始发展你自己的心理环境，一个可以与生命共存并对其产生影响的环境。很少有人能做到这一点，所以你没有很多成功的模式。也许你需要对我告诉你的事情有信心。如果你环顾四周，你可以看到每个人似乎都被这个世界超越了。事实上，你可能不知道有谁从支配大家的影响中获得了任何真正的独立。这方面的示范是罕见的，但非常重要。</p>
<p>The reclamation of Knowledge is not a popular movement. It is not a bandwagon. It is not something where you can take all your friends along with you. It is not something where you become a very popular person because you are studying The Way of Knowledge. Perhaps you will have to set out all alone and go in a different direction from everyone else. Everyone else is being swayed and pulled by forces that they are not even aware of. Most people will simply go along with whatever is being determined. Perhaps they will go along with it complaining all the way. Perhaps they will go along even sensing something is amiss, but they are not yet developed enough to exert an influence upon their lives sufficiently, to be able to reclaim their own sense of self and to have a sense of contribution in the world.</p>
<p>内识的开垦不是一个流行的运动。它不是一队人马。它不是你可以带着你所有的朋友一起去的东西。它不是让你成为一个非常受欢迎的人，因为你正在学习内识之路。也许你将不得不独自出发，走在与其他人不同的方向。其他人都被他们甚至没有意识到的力量所左右和牵引。大多数人只是顺从于正在决定的任何事情。也许他们会顺着它一路抱怨下去。也许他们会随波逐流，甚至感觉到有什么不对劲，但他们还没有发展到足以对自己的生命施加影响，能够重新获得自我意识，并对世界有贡献感。</p>
<p>Remember: Do not underestimate the power of the world. The Wise do not do this. The Wise do not claim omnipotent powers for themselves. Knowledge is silent in the world a great deal. It recognizes the power of the world. It casts its influence in ways that the world cannot obstruct. Like the flower giving fragrance, Knowledge exerts its influence. You can walk by the flower in an angry mood or in a happy mood, but it is exerting its fragrance nonetheless. Knowledge is hidden, so it cannot be removed or destroyed. It is silent because it permeates things. It is not in constant conversation with itself because it has no conflict and does not need to reassure itself.</p>
<p>请记住。不要低估世界的力量。智者不会这样做。智者不会为自己宣称有全能的力量。内识在这个世界上沉默了许多。它认识到世界的力量。它以世界无法阻挡的方式施展其影响力。就像花朵散发着香味，内识发挥着它的影响。你可以带着愤怒的心情或快乐的心情走过这朵花，但它还是在散发着它的香气。内识是隐藏的，所以它不能被移除或破坏。它是无声的，因为它渗透在世界中。它不与自己不断对话，因为它没有冲突，不需要自我安慰。</p>
<p>To come into contact with Knowledge means you are beginning to develop a sense of true self-assurance. You are beginning to become more silent, more still. You are beginning to talk less and to observe more. You are beginning to take on the qualities of Knowledge. You are beginning to realize that your influence on others is pervasive. Here you begin to take on a different set of attributes which are in keeping with your nature. Here you begin to realize that the greater influences are actually the ones which are more subtle, more pervasive and more permeating and that many of the gross influences, though they are perhaps loud, obnoxious and visible, are actually weaker than the subtle ones. Coming to this recognition is part of the great transformation that I am indicating, a transformation that is calling upon you now to prepare, to learn, to re-evaluate and to reclaim that which is truly yours.</p>
<p>与内识接触意味着你开始发展出一种真实的自我肯定感。你开始变得更加沉默，更加安静。你开始少说话，多观察。你开始具有内识的品质。你开始意识到你对他人的影响是普遍存在的。在这里，你开始具有一套不同的属性，这与你的本性是一致的。在这里，你开始意识到更大的影响实际上是那些更微妙、更普遍和更渗透的影响，许多粗暴的影响，尽管它们可能是响亮的、令人厌恶的和可见的，但实际上比微妙的影响更弱。达成这一认识是我所指出的伟大转变的一部分，这一转变现在正呼吁你准备、学习、重新评估并重新获得真正属于你的东西。</p>
