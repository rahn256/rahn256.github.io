<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on November 18, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois<br>1988 年 11 月 18 日，在伊利诺伊州芝加哥(Chicago, Illinois)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you participate fully in life, there are two domains you will be involved in. One is the manifestation of life, which is the world of physical things; the other is the Mystery of your life, which is the realm of deep experience. One is objective; the other is subjective. These are two different realms, and it is very important that you not confuse them. By this time, you know a fair amount about the world of manifestation—the physical world. But you do not know much about the world of profound experience. It is a different realm.</p>
<p>如果你完全参与到生命中，你将会涉及到两个领域。一个是生命的显现，也就是物理的世界；另一个是你生命的神秘，也就是更深层次经验的领域。一个是客观的；另一个是主观的。这是两个不同的领域，非常重要的是，你不要把它们混淆。在这个时候，你已经对显现的世界——物理世界——有相当多的了解。但你对更深层次经验的世界，你知之甚少。那是一个不同的领域。</p>
<p>With religion, no one wants to think they are being superstitious. That indicates you are believing in something that does not exist, which makes you look very foolish. And indeed, if you persist in doing this, you will feel that you are wasting your life. When religion disappoints, it is felt to be superstitious. The controversy of whether something is religion or superstition cannot be ended in the conscious, intellectual part of your mind which thrives on doubt and is afraid to get involved in anything very seriously. The controversy is resolved in another state of mind called Knowledge.</p>
<p>在宗教方面，没有人希望认为自己是迷信的。这表明你相信了一些不存在的东西，这会让你显得非常愚蠢。实际上，如果你坚持这样做，你会觉得自己在浪费生命。当宗教让人失望时，人们会觉得它是迷信的。关于某件事是宗教还是迷信的争议无法在你意识中的理智部分中结束，该部分满足于怀疑，并害怕认真参与任何事情。争议是在另一种称为内识的心智状态中解决的。</p>
<p>Therefore, do not try and understand all the things that we say from your personal mind because you cannot do that. It is fruitless to try. We want to take you to a greater state of mind where things can be known. In that state everything makes sense, though it is quite difficult to describe the experience once it is over because it sounds very fanciful.</p>
<p>因此，不要试图从你个人的心智中理解我们所说的所有事情，因为你无法做到这一点。尝试是没有结果的。我们想把你带到一个更大的心智状态，在那里事情可以被知道。在这种状态下，一切都有意义，尽管一旦经历结束，就很难描述这种经历，因为它听起来很虚幻。</p>
<p>The physical world is involved in the movement and interaction of things. The realm of Knowledge emphasizes the nature of true relationship, how things are truly related. Why is it important to know this? It is important because this is where your meaning comes from. Any sense of purpose in life that is genuine comes from this mysterious part of your life. In order to enjoy life, there must be Mystery. In order to grow in life, there must be Mystery. This means that there is a part of your life you participate in but do not understand.</p>
<p>物理世界涉及生命的运动和互动。内识的领域强调真实关系的性质，即生命是如何真正相关的。为什么知道这些很重要？它很重要，因为这是你的意义来自于此。任何真正的生命目的感都来自于你生命中的这个神秘部分。为了享受生活，必须有神秘感。为了在生命中成长，必须有神秘感。这意味着在你的生命中，有一部分你参与了，但却不理解。</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are to be a person who is evolving, do not allow yourself to have an understanding of life that is conclusive. As soon as you begin to think that you know what all things mean and are for, you begin to stop in your development. Your security must come from something greater than your own thought system and beliefs. If beliefs are what you establish your identity upon, well, you will not want to investigate life very much because if you do, you will begin to challenge and question the very ideas that you have accepted without question.</p>
<p>因此，如果你要成为一个不断发展的人，就不要让自己对生命有一个结论性的理解。一旦你开始认为你知道所有事情的意义和作用，你就开始停止发展。你的安全感必须来自于比你自己的思维体系和信仰更强大的内识。如果信仰是你建立自己身份的基础，那么，你就不会想去研究生命，因为如果你去研究，你就会开始挑战和质疑你所接受的那些想法，而不会有任何疑问。</p>
<p>For students of Knowledge, all of their assumptions will be questioned at various points until they find a greater foundation in life, a foundation that does not change and is not based upon popular opinion or social trends. Here they gain access to something that is beyond the world but which they can bring here. Wherever you can contribute Knowledge, it has a lasting and resonating effect. It is different from building something for the good of the people, something which they can use for a while until it is used up and discarded. When you give Knowledge, it continues to move from person to person.</p>
<p>对于学习内识的学生来说，他们所有的假设都会在不同的地方受到质疑，直到他们在生命中找到一个更伟大的基础，这个基础不会改变，也不基于流行的意见或社会趋势。在这里，他们获得了超越世界的东西，但他们可以把这些东西带到这里。无论在哪里，只要你能贡献出内识，就会产生持久的共鸣效应。这不同于为人民的利益而建造的东西，他们可以使用一段时间，直到它被用完和丢弃。当你给予内识时，它就会继续在人与人之间流动。</p>
<p>Why is Jesus still alive in the world? Because people are still giving Jesus, like a current running from person to person. You are all conduits for spiritual power. It will resonate naturally, but it will not pass through those who are not well prepared or who are not willing to think deeply about things. This leads to some unhappy consequences and, in a way, cannot be helped. The ignorant will attempt to use the truth foolishly. Those who do not want to question or investigate the Mystery of their lives will be happy only with assumptions that are comforting to them. These individuals, even though they were perhaps well meaning at the beginning, can become agents of destruction, as your history has so often indicated.</p>
<p>为什么耶稣仍然活在这个世界上？因为人们仍在给予耶稣，就像电流在人与人之间运行。你们都是精神力量的管道。它自然会产生共鸣，但它不会通过那些没有做好准备或不愿意深入思考问题的人。这导致了一些不愉快的后果，在某种程度上，也是无可奈何的。无知的人将试图愚蠢地使用真理。那些不愿意质疑或调查他们生命中的神秘的人，只会对那些让他们感到安慰的假设感到高兴。这些人，即使他们一开始也许是善意的，也会成为破坏的代理人，正如你们的历史经常表明的那样。</p>
<p>Religion is not the church. It is not a theological system of thought. Let me make a new definition for religion so that you can understand what I am talking about: Religion is profound experience. Out of this experience churches and theological systems arise, but they are not where you will find God. You must be in a different state of mind to comprehend the Creator, or you will merely create beliefs that will become superstitions.</p>
<p>宗教不是教会。它不是一个思维的神学体系。让我为宗教下一个新的定义，以便你能够理解我在说什么。宗教是深刻的经验。从这种经验中产生了教堂和神学体系，但它们不是你找到上帝的地方。你必须处于不同的心智状态来理解造物主，否则你将只是创造信仰，而这些信仰将成为迷信。</p>
<p>Our purpose is to bring people to true experience and to minimize the possibility of erroneous conclusions, inappropriate approaches, and so forth. This is not easy to achieve. You cannot do this with all people. You can only do this with a few, but the few can then give everything they have learned to others, and this creates a resonating effect.</p>
<p>我们的目的是把人们带到真实的经验中去，尽量减少错误的结论、不恰当的方法等的可能性。这并不容易实现。你不可能对所有的人都做到这一点。你只能对少数人做到这一点，但这少数人随后可以把他们所学到的一切传授给其他人，这就产生了共鸣的效果。</p>
<p>Why can you enjoy the comforts of what you have all around you? Because of what other people gave. I am talking about the people who invented electricity and all of your conveniences—everything! If anything, this is a world of gratitude. If you could experience that genuinely, well, it would be very difficult to be unhappy here. Unknowingly, you are enjoying the fruits of the labors of your ancestors every moment, every day. You are experiencing some of the liabilities of your ancestors, too, but the benefits far outweigh the liabilities.</p>
<p>为什么你能享受你周围所拥有的舒适生活？因为其他人给予了什么。我说的是那些发明了电和你所有的便利设施的人——一切！我说的是这些人。如果有的话，这就是一个充满感激的世界。如果你能真正地经历到这一点，那么，在这里就很难不快乐了。不知不觉中，你每时每刻、每一天都在享受你们祖先的劳动成果。你也在经历你祖先的一些责任，但好处远远超过责任。</p>
<p>Therefore, religion is also practical because it deals with the meaning of things, and meaning is what determines what you will want to do with your life and what you will value. What you value determines your behavior and communication with others. What you value is absolutely essential to your experience here.</p>
<p>因此，宗教也是实用的，因为它涉及到生命的意义，而意义是决定你想用你的生命做什么和你会重视什么。你的价值决定了你的行为和与他人的沟通。你的价值对于你在这里的经历绝对是至关重要的。</p>
<p>Now, I want to make an important distinction which will require some thought. Do not confuse Mystery and manifestation. This means that when you are dealing with physical things, deal with them physically. Understand the process of how they work. This becomes very obvious when you think about it, but it is incredible how people do not do this very much and how ineffectual they are as a result. If your car breaks down, do not deal with it spiritually. Do not make it a religious experience! You may have a religious experience that is related to the car breaking down, but it does not fix the car. If you break your arm, do not deal with it as a religious experience. It is a mechanical problem. Perhaps your reasons for breaking your arm go much further, but in terms of repair, do the repair. Do not think of mechanical things as mysterious things. This gives them a value and a meaning that they do not have because the Mystery is much greater and goes beyond the manifestation of things.</p>
<p>现在，我想做一个重要的区分，这将需要一些思考。不要混淆神秘和显现。这意味着，当你在处理物理事件时，要从物理上处理它们。理解它们的工作过程。当你思考的时候，这就变得非常明显，但令人难以置信的是，人们不怎么做这个，结果是多么的无效。如果你的车坏了，不要从精神上处理它。不要让它成为一种宗教体验!你可能会有一个与汽车故障有关的宗教经验，但这并不能解决汽车问题。如果你的胳膊断了，不要把它当作宗教体验来处理。这是一个物理上的问题。也许你折断手臂的原因更多，但就恢复而言，要做补救。不要把物理上的事件当成神秘的事件。这给了它们一个价值和意义，而它们并没有这个价值和意义，因为神秘的内识要大得多，而且超越了物理的表现形式。</p>
<p>Do you know what happens when people confuse manifestation with Mystery? They become entranced with marvelous things and they miss the obvious. Their imagination takes over. Likewise, it is very important not to deal with Mystery in a logical way. Do not treat Mystery objectively. It requires a different approach. Each realm requires a different approach. If you become scientific about God, well, you will create a great deal of thought about God, but you will still be far removed from the experience, and you will go off in the wrong direction. This is not the realm of scientific approach, and you cannot deal with it logically. God is illogical.</p>
<p>你知道当人们把显现和神秘混为一谈时会发生什么吗？他们被奇妙的事件迷住了，他们错过了明显的事情。他们的想象力占据了上风。同样地，不要以逻辑的方式处理神秘，这一点非常重要。不要客观地对待神秘事件。它需要一种不同的方法。每个领域都需要一种不同的方法。如果你对上帝变得科学，好吧，你会创造大量关于上帝的思维，但你仍然会远离经历，你会走错方向。这不是科学方法的范畴，你不能从逻辑上处理它。上帝是不符合逻辑的。</p>
<p>There is so much Mystery in your life! How much bearing does this have on your everyday decisions and experience? A great deal. So, the important distinction to make is: Do not deal with manifestation mysteriously and do not deal with Mystery logically. They require different approaches. When you make everything mysterious, you lose touch with what is obvious and you will live in fantasy about everything. That is both pathetic and dangerous for you and your race.</p>
<p>在你的生命中，有那么多神秘的东西!这对你的日常决定和经验有多大影响？非常多。所以，要做的重要区分是。不要以神秘的方式处理显现，也不要以逻辑的方式处理神秘的问题。它们需要不同的方法。当你把一切都弄得很神秘时，你就会与显现的世界失去联系，你会对一切都生活在幻想中。这对你和你的种族来说既可悲又危险。</p>
<p>Your true state of mind, Knowledge, generally deals with material things in a very down-to-earth fashion and deals with things that are beyond the material in a wholly different way, naturally. There is no confusion of levels or different realms here.</p>
<p>你真实的心智状态，内识，通常以一种非常朴实的方式处理物理的事件，并以一种完全不同的方式处理超越物理的事件，自然。这里没有层级或不同领域的混淆。</p>
<p>God is like a place you go where you experience something extraordinary, and the result of this experience affects the direction of your life, the expression of your life and what you value. God is everywhere. God is a constant Presence, constantly giving, giving, giving.</p>
<p>上帝就像你去的一个地方，在那里你会经历到一些非同寻常的关系，而这种经历的结果会影响你的生命方向，你生命表达的方式和你的价值。上帝无处不在。上帝是一个持续的临在，不断地给予、提供、供应。</p>
<p>Is religion superstition? Is it people fooling themselves because they are insecure? Are they looking for escape? Do they just want to believe in something because their lives have no meaning? No matter how devout you may feel you are, you will have times when you have these questions. Yes, you will, and it is okay. You can say, “Go to Hell, God! I’ve had it with you! I’m going to go out and make money and get smart.” You see, you love God so much that sometimes when you reject God, you get closer because when you reject God, nothing happens in return. You always go back to God because it is the only thing to go back to and because the world of manifestation is temporary, and the world of Mystery is permanent.</p>
<p>宗教是迷信吗？是人们因为没有安全感而自欺欺人吗？他们是在寻找逃避吗？他们只是想相信什么，因为他们的生活没有意义？无论你觉得自己有多虔诚，你都会有遇到这些问题的时候。是的，你会，这没关系。你可以说：”去死吧，上帝！我受够了！”。我已经受够了你!我要出去挣钱，变得聪明。”你看，你如此爱上帝，以至于有时你拒绝上帝时，你会变得更亲近，因为当你拒绝上帝时，没有什么事情会发生，作为回报。你总是回到上帝身边，因为它是唯一可以回去的内识，而且因为显现的世界是暂时的，而神秘的世界是永久的。</p>
<p>While you are in the world, you can only know so much about the Mystery, but it is enough to receive its benefits. If you had the capacity to fully understand the Mystery, you would not be in the world. Your mind would be too broad and great. You could not deal with specific things. Therefore, I am not saying you must understand the Mystery. I want you to become aware of it and allow it to have a place in your life.</p>
<p>当你在这个世界上时，你只能知道这么多关于神秘的内识，但这足以让你得到它的好处。如果你有能力完全理解神秘，你就不会在这个世界上了。你的心智会过于宽广和伟大。你不可能处理特定的事情。因此，我并不是说你必须理解这个神秘。我希望你能意识到它，并允许它在你的生命中占有一席之地。</p>
<p>Your Teachers know about everything you want—all your preferences, everything. You don’t need to say, “I want to find my husband or wife.” They know this already. Perhaps you need to say it to convince yourself that you are finally willing to do something about it or that you want something else. Here you may be enlisting yourself into active duty, but the Teachers know already.</p>
<p>你的老师知道你想要的一切——你所有的喜好，一切。你不需要说，”我想找到我的丈夫或妻子”。他们已经知道这一点。也许你需要说出来，以说服自己，你终于愿意做点什么，或者你想要别的东西。在这里，你可能是在征召自己进入现役，但老师们已经知道了。</p>
<p>You know, when people begin their spiritual development, in the early stages they are like children. They want everything, but they have very little capacity for anything that they want. “I want God! I want a holy marriage! I want spiritual powers and discernment and freedom from conflict now—or by the end of this year at least.” But the capacity for these things has not yet been developed. When the capacity is developed, well, things happen of themselves. Better, then, to develop people’s capacity so that they can actually experience these things.</p>
<p>你知道，当人们开始他们的精神发展时，在早期阶段他们就像孩子一样。他们什么都想要，但他们对自己想要的东西却没有什么能力。”我想要上帝!我想要一个神圣的婚姻!我现在就想要精神的力量和辨别力，以及从冲突中解脱出来，或者至少在今年年底前”。但是这些东西的能力还没有被开发出来。当能力得到发展时，事情就会自动发生。那么，最好是发展人们的能力，以便他们能够实际经历这些事情。</p>
<p>Why am I here? Because I remind you of where you have come from, which is not the world of manifestation. Why does it take human beings so long to become functional in the world if they are so intelligent? Why is that? After all, other animals are moving about doing things in a day or two days or a week. You may call it instinct, but it is much more intelligent. Why does it take people so long to learn the basics? The world is a very unnatural place for a being who has a conscience. You are all visitors here. It was necessary that you forget where you came from in order to be here. That is part of the process of being here. But you are obviously visitors. You are here a very short time. You will continue on after you leave here. You have no choice about that. You have a choice about what state you will continue on in, but the fact that you will continue is beyond your control.</p>
<p>我为什么在这里？因为我提醒你从哪里来，这不是显现的世界。如果人类如此聪明，为什么要花这么长时间才能在这个世界上发挥作用？这是为什么呢？毕竟，其他动物在一天、两天或一个星期内就开始行动做事情了。你可以说这是本能，但它要聪明得多。为什么人们需要这么长时间来学习基本知识？对于一个有良知的生命来说，这个世界是一个非常不自然的地方。你们都是这里的访客。为了来到这里，你有必要忘记你来自哪里。它是在这里的过程的一部分。但你显然是访客。你在这里的时间很短。在你离开这里后，你将继续下去。你对此没有选择。你可以选择你将以何种状态继续下去，但你将继续下去这一事实是你无法控制的。</p>
<p>I represent the Mystery of your life. You do not necessarily need to understand me, but you can experience me, and if you experience me enough, perhaps you will learn to trust me. The only way you can trust me is by seeing that I am good and by having this demonstrated in your life. This is very important because this opens you up to a whole level of support, assistance and direction that you could not provide for yourself. Now you have a great asset, and the Mystery of your life can serve to direct your life in the world in a meaningful way. The Mystery will give you a new way of dealing with the world you see and sense. It is extremely practical and effective.</p>
<p>我代表你生命的神秘。你不一定需要理解我，但你可以经历我，如果你经历我足够多，也许你会学会信任我。你能信任我的唯一方法是看到我是好的，并在你的生命中证明这一点。这是非常重要的，因为这为你打开了整个层次的支持、帮助和指导，而这是你无法为自己提供的。现在你有了一笔巨大的财富，你生命的神秘可以以一种有意义的方式来指导你在世界上的生活。神秘将给你一种新的方式来处理你所看见和感觉到的世界。它是极其实用和有效的。</p>
<p>There are many people who talk about religion and think they are religious, but they have only accepted religious assumptions and have not entered into the real experience. For them, it is self-comfort they are seeking, and they will build their sense of themselves upon these assumptions and will be terrified when these assumptions are challenged by anyone or anything. That is why it is very important that you have exposure to things and learn to discern things and allow your assumptions about life to be questioned. That is how you progress. After all, if I am real, many of your assumptions are not.</p>
<p>有很多人谈论宗教，认为自己是宗教徒，但他们只是接受了宗教的假设，并没有进入真正的经历中。对他们来说，他们追求的是自我安慰，他们会把自己的感觉建立在这些假设之上，当这些假设受到任何人或事的挑战时，他们会感到害怕。这就是为什么你要接触事物，学会辨别事物，让你对生命的假设受到质疑是非常重要的。这是你进步的方式。毕竟，如果我是真的，你的许多假设就不是真的。</p>
<p>You cannot find a way to use the Mystery to help the world because you are not in control of the Mystery. You can only control your exposure to the Mystery and your acceptance of it. You cannot make it do what you want it to do for the world. The world needs a great deal, but you can only give to it according to what capacities you have. Therefore, if you develop a greater capacity and a greater wealth of experience, you will have more to contribute. The greatest contribution that can be rendered into the world is Knowledge. Here something greater is giving itself through you. It is not you trying to improve the situation according to what you like or dislike. Something greater is moving you naturally to do this or do that. Something greater is then given and transmitted from person to person. Whether you are building a hospital or feeding a sick person, something greater is being transmitted. The current is now flowing through you. You are a witness to it. You are still doing practical things to help the world, but there is a Spiritual Presence that is moving through you. You are conducting its current. This is very mysterious. Your understanding of it can only go so far. It is profound and your questions will remain.</p>
<p>你无法找到一种方法来利用神秘的东西来帮助世界，因为你无法控制神秘的内识。你只能控制你对神秘的接触和你对它的接受。你不能让它做你想让它为世界做的事。世界需要大量的东西，但你只能根据你所拥有的能力来给予它。因此，如果你发展出更大的能力和更丰富的经验，你将有更多的贡献。能为世界做出的最大贡献是内识。在这里，有更伟大的东西正在通过你来给予自己。这不是你试图根据你喜欢或不喜欢的东西来改善情况。更伟大的内识在自然地推动你做这个或做那个。更伟大的内识就会被给予，并在人与人之间传递。无论你是在建造医院还是在喂养病人，更伟大的内识正在被传递。水流现在正流过你。你是它的见证者。你仍然在做实际的事情来帮助这个世界，但有一个精神的临在正在你身上流动。你正在传导它的水流。这是很神秘的。你对它的理解只能走到这里。它是深刻的，你的问题将继续存在。</p>
<p>That is why in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, we take people to a certain state of mind, and then something inside of them takes over. It is the very heart of them, the very center of them that begins to become manifest. The preparation is to make their outer life free enough to allow this to happen and to make their mind clear enough so that the light can shine through. This requires both an inner and an outer preparation.</p>
<p>这就是为什么在大社区内识之路中，我们把人们带到某种心智状态，然后他们内在的内识就会接管。这是他们的心脏，是他们的中心，开始变得明显。准备工作是使他们的外部生活足够自由，以允许这种情况发生，并使他们的心智足够清晰，以便光线能够照亮。这需要内在和外在的准备。</p>
<p>Your ability to be practical in life is very important here because you do not want your outer activities to interfere with what is happening on the inside. Inner and outer development are related, but I tell you, the influence is only one way. The manifestation does not influence the Mystery. The manifestation of things—the course of events, your history, all that happens here—cannot influence the Mystery.</p>
<p>你在生活中的实际能力在这里非常重要，因为你不希望你的外在活动干扰内心正在发生的事情。内在和外在的发展是相关的，但我告诉你，这种影响只是一种方式。显现并不影响神秘。世界的显现——事件的过程、你的历史、这里发生的一切——不能影响神秘。</p>
<p>The Mystery influences the manifestation. God influences the world. The world does not influence God. The world influences you a great deal, so it is very hard for you to understand that the world does not influence God. Yet, as you become closer to God in your thinking, the world will influence you less and you will influence it more. That is when your ability to contribute becomes greater, and you are able to transmit something beyond your actions. Beyond what you can do physically, you can transmit a profound quality of love that has a great bearing on the lives of others. Indeed, it can kindle the spark of Knowledge in another. There is no idea I can give you that can initiate you into Knowledge. Only the power of my own Knowledge can do that. I can do all manner of things for you, but Knowledge can only be ignited and transferred. You must be prepared for this.</p>
<p>神秘影响着显现。上帝影响着世界。世界并不影响上帝。世界对你有很大的影响，所以你很难理解世界不影响上帝。然而，当你在思维上变得更接近上帝时，世界对你的影响就会减少，你对它的影响就会增加。这时你的贡献能力变得更大，你能够传递一些超越你行动的东西。在你身体所能做到的之外，你可以传递一种深刻的爱的品质，对他人的生命有很大的影响。事实上，它可以在另一个人身上点燃内识的火花。我不能给你任何想法，使你进入内识。只有我自己的内识的力量可以做到这一点。我可以为你做各种事情，但内识只能被点燃和转移。你必须为此做好准备。</p>
<p>Now, you must give great thought to these things that I am telling you. Do not say, “Well, I believe in this, but I don’t believe in that,” or “I think this is real, but I reject that.” When you do that, you are merely defending your assumptions. That is being mindless. You have a good mind. You must use it now to do a little investigating. When you investigate, avoid the temptation to come to conclusions. If you were digging in the ground for buried treasure or a hidden city on an archaeological dig, you wouldn’t jump to conclusions. You would carry on the investigation—until you came to the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
<p>现在，你必须认真考虑我告诉你的这些事情。不要说：”好吧，我相信这个，但我不相信那个，”或者”我认为这个是真的，但我拒绝那个。”当你这么做时，你只是在为你的假设辩护。那是无意识的行为。你有一个好的心智。你现在必须用它来做一点调查。当你调查时，要避免得出结论的诱惑。如果你在地下挖出埋藏的宝藏或考古挖掘的隐藏城市，你不会轻易下结论。你会继续调查，直到你得出调查的结论。</p>
<p>People who are happy always have Mystery in their lives because they are always excited about learning new things. Life for them is an adventure. It is difficult, but it is magical as well.</p>
<p>幸福的人在他们的生活中总是有神秘感，因为他们总是对学习新事物感到兴奋。生命对他们来说是一种冒险。它是困难的，但它也是神奇的。</p>
<p>Religion must be mysterious. If you are to have a religious life, you must allow Mystery to exist. It is like a great well in the ground, a well that is so deep that you cannot see the bottom, but from its depth come things that are important. If you have Mystery in your life, you can still be a rational person who deals with the world in a practical way. There need not be any conflict here, if you understand that you need to deal with tangible things tangibly. Yet, there is simply another part of your life that represents the religion of your life, which is the source of your meaning, purpose and direction.</p>
<p>宗教必须是神秘的。如果你要有一个宗教生活，你必须允许神秘感的存在。它就像地下的一口大井，这口井很深，你看不到井底，但从它的深处传来重要的东西。如果你的生命中有神秘感，你仍然可以成为一个理性的人，以实用的方式处理世界。这里不需要有任何冲突，如果你明白你需要实实在在地处理有形的事情。然而，在你的生命中还有一个简单的部分，它代表了你生命的宗教，是你意义、目的和方向的来源。</p>
<p>It is important for you to be practical because this enables you to get things done. You are here to do things. This is a place where things are done. This place is not where you have come from. You don’t do here what you did there, because “there” is not a place of doing. It is a place of being. This is a place of doing. That is why you have a body, and that is why you have a personal mind to direct the body. So, doing things is the emphasis here. The more competent you are, the more you can bring things about. But if you are merely competent and nothing else, your life will be empty and desolate, and you will find little comfort in the world of manifestation because its offerings are very limited compared to what the Mystery of life has to yield for you.</p>
<p>对你来说，实用是很重要的，因为这能让你把事情做好。你在这里是为了做事。这是一个做事的地方。这个地方不是你来的地方。你在这里不做你在那里做的事，因为”那里”不是一个做事的地方。它是一个存在的地方。这里是一个做事的地方。这就是为什么你有一个身体，这就是为什么你有一个个人的心智来指导这个身体。所以，做事情是这里的重点。你越有能力，你就越能带来事情。但是，如果你只是有能力而没有别的，你的生命将是空虚和荒凉的，你将在显现的世界中找到很少的安慰，因为与生命的神秘为你提供的东西相比，它提供的东西是非常有限的。</p>
<p>You only have to wonder about where you have come from and where you are going to see how much Mystery is a part of your life. You actually know very little about anything, except perhaps the mechanical things that are right in front of you. That is okay, because there is a great deal of Mystery. Mystery can be known. You know something because you are in relationship with it. You understand something when you are separate from it. When you understand something, you may figure out its process, how it works, its stages of development and how it influences other things. Yet, when something is known, it is because you are experiencing a relationship with it. This is a different kind of interaction and involvement.</p>
<p>你只要想一想你从哪里来，要到哪里去，就会发现有多少神秘是你生命中的一部分。你实际上对任何事情都知之甚少，也许除了就在你面前的物理上的世界。这没关系，因为有大量的神秘。神秘可以被知道。你知道一些东西，因为你与它有关系。当你与它分开时，你就理解了某物。当你理解某物时，你可能会弄清楚它的过程，它如何工作，它的发展阶段，以及它如何影响其他事物。然而，当某物被知道时，是因为你正在经历与它的关系。这是一种不同的互动和参与。</p>
<p>There are people who understand a great deal about their relationships—their influences, the other person’s influences, how they interact, their tendencies, their fears, their compulsions, their strengths, their weaknesses. Perhaps they’ve gone through ten years of analysis to understand everything about their relationship. Yet they do not know each other. You can know someone without knowing anything about his or her life. That does not mean you should marry this person. Don’t do that! People often get married because they have this experience of recognition with another. That is because they are confusing Mystery with manifestation. “Well, if I have this profound recognition with another, he (or she) must be my partner.” That is not a correct assumption, but many people make it and do not question it. Then they find out later if there is any relationship there.</p>
<p>有些人非常理解他们的关系——他们的影响，对方的影响，他们如何互动，他们的倾向，他们的恐惧，他们的强迫症，他们的优势，他们的弱点。也许他们已经经历了十年的分析，理解他们关系的一切。然而，他们并不理解对方。你可以在不理解某人的生命的情况下理解他或她。这并不意味着你应该嫁给这个人。不要这样做人们常常因为有这种承认另一个人的经历而结婚。那是因为他们把神秘与显现混为一谈。”好吧，如果我与另一个人有这种深刻的认同，他（或她）一定是我的伴侣。”这不是一个正确的假设，但许多人做了这个假设，并没有质疑它。然后他们后来发现那里是否有任何关系。</p>
<p>There is no reason why a man or woman of science cannot have profound Mystery in life. There is no reason why a person with great involvement in Mystery cannot be a competent and effective person. In this way, you can give to the world what is the world’s, and you give to God what is God’s. There is no problem, unless you try to make them the same. Then all manner of contradictions and dilemmas arise.</p>
<p>一个有科学内识的男人或女人没有理由不在生活中拥有深刻的神秘感。一个对神秘有极大参与的人没有理由不能成为一个有能力和有效的人。以这种方式，你可以把属于世界的东西交给世界，把属于上帝的东西交给上帝。没有任何问题，除非你试图使它们相同。然后就会出现各种形式的矛盾和困境。</p>
<p>It is not a problem with God that there is pain and misery in the world. That does not mean that God is not helping you with it, but it is not a problem for God. Does that not sound heartless? It does not mean that God does not care. God is God no matter what is going on here because God is that big. But God also brings resolution, balance and harmony to everything that is within God. Why, then, is there conflict in the world if God is all powerful, or seemingly so? If God brings resolution to all things, why is there not resolution here? The answer to that question lies in your relationship with God. If you only want God to be in your life ten percent, what is the other ninety percent of your life? If there is ten percent God in your life, there is ninety percent something else. In the world, God is about two percent. I am talking about God as a mysterious, profound, direct experience.</p>
<p>世界上存在着痛苦和不幸，这对上帝来说不是问题。这并不意味着上帝不帮助你解决这个问题，但这对上帝来说不是一个问题。这听起来是不是很无情？这并不意味着上帝不关心。无论这里发生了什么，上帝都是上帝，因为上帝就是那么大。但上帝也给上帝内的一切带来解决、平衡和和谐。那么，如果上帝是全能的，或者看起来是全能的，为什么世界上会有冲突？如果上帝给万物带来解决，为什么这里没有解决呢？这个问题的答案在于你与上帝的关系。如果你只希望上帝在你的生命中占百分之十，那么你生命中的另外百分之九十是什么？如果在你的生命中有百分之十的上帝，那么还有百分之九十的其他东西。在这个世界上，上帝大约是百分之二。我说的是上帝是一种神秘、深刻、直接的经历。</p>
<p>God cannot take away from you what you want to do here, but God can influence you to return to Knowledge. Knowledge is a very different state of mind. I want to make this very clear so that you will then think, “How can I attain this state of mind?” instead of “How can I use this to make things happen in the world?” From your personal mind, the world cannot be known. The source, nature and resolution of conflict cannot be known.</p>
<p>上帝不能从你这里夺走你想做的事，但上帝可以影响你回到内识。内识是一种非常不同的心智状态。我想把这一点说得很清楚，这样你就会想：”我怎样才能达到这种心智状态？”而不是”我怎样才能用这个来使世界上的事情发生？”从你个人心智来看，世界是无法知道的。冲突的来源、性质和解决方法也无法得知。</p>
<p>People become students of Knowledge because it is natural for them to do so. There is little other incentive. I do not promise people, “If you study this, you shall have wealth, love, greater powers or be better than others.” That is not the incentive. The incentive is beyond all this. You come to Knowledge because Knowledge brings you, because you are moved by something greater.</p>
<p>人们成为内识的学生，是因为他们很自然地要这样做。没有什么其他的激励因素。我不会向人们承诺：”如果你学习这个，你将拥有财富、爱情、更大的力量或比别人更好。这不是激励因素。激励是超越这一切的。你来学习内识是因为内识带给你，因为你被更伟大的东西所推动。</p>
<p>In the beginning, people doubt and fight this great inclination because it will change their lives. It seems so impractical, and they can’t understand it. My God! If you had to fully understand what you were doing, you would never be able to do anything new! Understanding is always associated with the past. It is always an attempt to understand the present from the past. All scientific advancement and all true advancement on any level occurred because certain individuals moved forward without understanding what they were doing and then found something new.</p>
<p>一开始，人们怀疑并对抗这种伟大的倾向，因为它将改变他们的生活。它看起来如此不切实际，而且他们无法理解它。我的上帝啊如果你必须完全理解你正在做的事情，你将永远无法做任何新的事情!理解总是与过去有关。它总是试图从过去理解现在。所有的科学进步和任何层面的真实进步都是因为某些人在没有理解他们正在做的事情的情况下向前迈进，然后发现了新的东西。</p>
<p>It is very important to be honest enough with yourself to say, “In that situation, I do not know what I am doing, but in this situation I do know what I am doing.” If you do not know what you are doing over there, it does not mean that you do not know what you are doing somewhere else. Because you are developing in the world, you will always have a large part of your life that cannot be explained or is not yet discovered. So, why come to grand conclusions about anything? You’ll just have to give them up! There is no comfort in thinking, “I finally understand the way things are!” You finally understand the way things are only for a little while.</p>
<p>对自己足够诚实是非常重要的，可以说：”在那种情况下，我不知道我在做什么，但在这种情况下，我知道我在做什么。”如果你不知道你在那里做什么，这并不意味着你不知道你在其他地方做什么。因为你在这个世界上发展，你的生命中总会有很大一部分无法解释或尚未被发现。所以，为什么要对任何事情下宏大的结论？你只能放弃它们!认为”我终于明白了世界的真相！”是没有任何安慰的。你最终理解世界的方式只是一小段时间。</p>
<p>Enlightenment is not a one-time thing, you know. You will become enlightened again and again. There are major breakthroughs. One leads to the next. When you have broken through one, you are now a beginner in a new realm. It is so exciting! I very much enjoy this! But after all, I don’t have the practical burdens you do. Not now, anyway. Yet, I have responsibilities that would be crushing to you, but you know, I’m not worried about it. That is why I’m so effective. If I were worried about you, what could I do for you? I’d become desperate, and then you would have two desperate people! But I am very interested in your finding your treasure and not wasting your time in life. Your treasure is what you came here to give, but to find this, you must establish your foundation in the Mystery, and you must become competent in the world.</p>
<p>开悟不是一次性的，你知道。你会一次又一次地开悟。有一些重大的突破。一个导致下一个。当你突破了一个，你现在是一个新境界的初学者。这真是太令人兴奋了!我非常享受这个!但毕竟，我没有你那样的实际负担。无论如何，现在没有。然而，我的责任会让你感到崩溃，但你知道，我并不担心这个问题。这就是为什么我如此有效。如果我担心你，我能为你做什么？我会变得很绝望，然后你就会有两个绝望的人！这就是为什么我对你很感兴趣。但我非常关心你找到你的宝藏，不要浪费你的生命时间。你的宝藏是你来这里的目的，但要找到这个，你必须在神秘中建立你的基础，你必须在这个世界上变得有能力。</p>
<p>What you are looking for is not an answer. It is a discovery and a set of abilities that are related to that discovery. Don’t think that I will come along and say, “You are going to be this!” and that takes care of the problem. When people think like that, they are being lazy; they are being passive. To do what you must do in the future, you will have to be a greater person than you are now. You will have to be stronger and more open.</p>
<p>你所寻找的不是一个答案。它是一个发现和一套与这个发现有关的能力。不要以为我会走过来说：”你将成为这样的人！”这样就能解决问题。当人们这样想的时候，他们是在偷懒；他们是在被动。要做你将来必须做的事，你必须成为一个比现在更大的人。你必须更强大，更开放。</p>
<p>By the way, don’t worry about the world blowing up. What is happening in the world is that humanity is in the process of becoming one race, and my God, it will go through terrible things to do this. But this is its evolution, and it must come to pass. As the adolescent must become an adult, painfully or not, the evolution of your race cannot be stopped. Conflict can be moderated and in many cases eliminated, but it takes a person who has a very great awareness to be able to give this perspective to other people.</p>
<p>顺便说一下，不要担心世界会爆炸。世界上正在发生的是，人类正在成为一个种族的过程中，我的上帝，它将经历可怕的事情来做到这一点。但这是它的进化，它必须实现。正如青少年必须成为成年人一样，不管是否痛苦，你们种族的进化是不能被阻止的。冲突可以被缓和，在很多情况下可以被消除，但这需要一个有非常大的意识的人，能够给其他人提供这种观点。</p>
<p>In the future, everyone will have to be in relationship with everyone. That will be terrible for some people because when that happens, people begin to sacrifice their national identity, their class consciousness and all these other distinguishing factors, some of which they may never have thought of. “Rub shoulders with these people? Oh, my God, no!” But everyone will have to confront everyone. Here, the distinctions will begin to break down. It is not that everyone will become equal because that will never happen, not at this level, anyway. But people will need to develop a greater capacity for relationship with one another. They will also need to develop a greater level of discernment as well because with greater exposure to anything, you must have greater discernment and greater education.</p>
<p>在未来，每个人都必须与所有人建立关系。这对一些人来说将是可怕的，因为当这种情况发生时，人们开始牺牲他们的民族身份，他们的阶级意识和所有这些其他的区别因素，其中一些他们可能从来没有想过。”与这些人擦肩而过？哦，我的上帝，不！”但每个人都将不得不面对所有人。在这里，区别将开始被打破。这并不是说每个人都会变得平等，因为这永远不会发生，无论如何，在这个层面上不会。但是人们将需要发展出更大的能力来处理彼此之间的关系。他们也将需要发展出更高的辨别力，因为随着对任何关系的更多接触，你必须有更大的辨别力和更多的教育。</p>
<p>So, there are conflicts and they will continue, but the world will not blow up. There are forces in the world to keep this from happening. It is possible these forces can fail, but it hasn’t happened yet. Do not think the fate of the world is up to people alone.</p>
<p>因此，有冲突，它们将继续，但世界不会爆炸。世界上有一些力量在阻止这种情况的发生。这些力量有可能会失败，但它还没有发生。不要认为世界的命运是由人单独决定的。</p>
<p>God is always there. Yet, in the realm of worldly existence, you can either have God or not. You are free to not be in this relationship. When you are not being in this relationship, you are lost in your thinking. You are living in your thoughts and in other people’s thoughts. After all, to not be yourself you must be something else, yes? To not serve God, you must serve something else. You must serve something, but that does not mean that what is real has changed. What does not change is the greatest foundation you can have, but you must experience it repeatedly, and you must refrain from making conclusions about it. This leaves the door to God wide open.</p>
<p>上帝一直在那里。然而，在世俗存在的领域里，你可以拥有上帝，也可以没有。你有不在这种关系中的自由。当你不在这种关系中时，你就迷失在你的思维中。你生活在你的思维和其他人的思维中。毕竟，为了不做自己，你必须做别的人，不是吗？为了不侍奉上帝，你必须侍奉别的东西。你必须服务于某些东西，但这并不意味着真实的内识已经改变。不变的内识是你能拥有的最大基础，但你必须反复经历它，而且你必须避免对它作出结论。这让通往上帝的大门打开。</p>
<p>Even the manifestation is a Mystery, but for the sake of practicality, we don’t make everything religious. There are problems in doing that. There is a distinction between the influence and the manifestation, and the manifestation rarely completely demonstrates the Mystery because it is a physical thing.</p>
<p>即使是表现形式也是一个谜，但为了实用，我们不会把一切都变成宗教。这样做是有问题的。影响和表现之间是有区别的，表现很少完全展示神秘，因为它是一个物理的事件。</p>
<p>If Knowledge moved you to invent something, you would invent it, and you would go through a physical process to do that. What you would invent could be understood, but what moved you to do it is mysterious. This must be thought about because what moves people to do things and the things that they do are related, as cause and effect, but they are not the same. The pure experience that moved individuals to create a new manifestation in life may be something that those individuals could never describe in words, but it is something that they can transmit through their creations. Whatever they were moved to do is a temporary thing, but it was moved by something permanent. What is permanent seems very difficult to distinguish from anything in the world because everything here is moving and is impermanent.</p>
<p>如果内识打动了你去发明什么，你会去发明它，你会通过一个物理过程去做。你会发明什么可以被理解，但是什么打动了你去做这件事是神秘的。必须思考这个问题，因为推动人们做事的因素和他们所做的事情是相关的，就像因果关系一样，但它们是不一样的。打动个人在生命中创造新表现的纯粹经历可能是这些人永远无法用语言描述的，但这是他们可以通过创造物传递的东西。无论他们被推动做什么，都是暂时的事情，但它是被某种持久的东西所推动。永久的内识似乎很难与世界上的任何东西区分开来，因为这里的一切都正在被推动，是无常的。</p>
<p>So, what is constant in the world? What is constant has an influence, and it brings about good results, but the results that it brings about still do not identify or exemplify the full power of the Mystery. With Mystery you will contribute to the world because you are happy and not because you are terrified. If you think that the world is about to blow up and you are desperate to do something about it, your contribution will be violent. You will be forced to take sides, and you will have enemies. The Mystery does not think like this. It does not have enemies. It merely has people who are not willing to move, so it works around them. It is like the air that comes in through all the cracks.</p>
<p>那么，世界上什么是永恒的？恒定的东西有影响，它带来了好的结果，但它带来的结果仍然不能确定或体现出神秘的全部力量。有了神秘感，你将为世界做出贡献，因为你是快乐的，而不是因为你是恐惧的。如果你认为世界即将爆炸，你不顾一切地想做点什么，你的贡献将是暴力的。你将被迫站队，你将有敌人。神秘的东西不是这样想的。它没有敌人。它只是有一些不愿意行动的人，所以它在他们周围工作。它就像从所有缝隙中进入的空气。</p>
<p>The problem with religions is that they are at war with each other’s manifestations and assumptions. That is not a problem for individuals who are grounded in religious experience. But people who are relating only to the manifestation will compete with one another and threaten one another because at this level of existence there is only identification with ideas. Here they will not want to challenge their own ideas because then the whole foundation of their identity will be threatened. That is a very mindless state and many people live there. If you think of religion only in terms of its manifestations—which are the behaviors exhibited by those who profess to believe in it, its tenets and its impact on people’s lives—then you are only dealing with religion as a political force.</p>
<p>宗教的问题是，它们与彼此的表现和假设交战。对于那些立足于宗教经历的人来说，这不是一个问题。但只与表现形式有关的人将相互竞争，相互威胁，因为在这个存在层面上，只有对观念的认同。在这里，他们不会想挑战自己的想法，因为那样他们身份的整个基础就会受到威胁。那是一种非常无意识的状态，很多人都生活在那里。如果你只从宗教的表现上考虑——也就是那些声称相信宗教的人所表现出来的行为，它的信条和它对人们生活的影响——那么你就只把宗教作为一种政治力量来处理。</p>
<p>Now, I know that everything that happens in the world will eventually have a political expression and that anything good that is given to the world will be used by someone to produce harm. I know that. I know that even The Greater Community Way of Knowledge that I am presenting will be misused by many people. Does that mean I should not give it? No, it is simply the liability of giving in the world. I know that and I am prepared for it. Jesus Christ was prepared for it. How many people have slaughtered other people in the name of Jesus Christ? How much violence has been wrought in the name of Jesus Christ? How would you like it if your name were slandered like that? Does that mean that Jesus Christ should not have given his gift? I assure you he was aware of the price that would be paid. That is the conflict.</p>
<p>现在，我知道世界上发生的每一件事最终都会有一个政治表现，任何给予世界的好处都会被人利用来产生伤害。我知道这一点。我知道，即使是我提出的大社区内识之路也会被许多人滥用。这是否意味着我不应该给予它？不，这只是世界上给予的责任。我知道这一点，而且我已经准备好了。耶稣基督也为此做好了准备。有多少人以耶稣基督的名义屠杀了其他人？有多少暴力事件是以耶稣基督的名义进行的？如果你的名字被这样诽谤，你会喜欢吗？这是否意味着耶稣基督不应该给予他的礼物？我向你保证，他知道要付出的代价。这就是矛盾所在。</p>
<p>If the level of a few individuals can be raised, everyone will benefit. Humanity has always moved forward because of the work of a handful of people. They bring the Mystery into the world and everyone else manifests it and uses it, but where it comes from very few know.</p>
<p>如果少数人的水平能够得到提高，那么所有人都会受益。人类总是因为少数人的工作而向前迈进。他们把神秘的东西带到世界上，而其他人则表现它并使用它，但很少有人知道它来自哪里。</p>
<p>It is not a problem for me if people do not grow, even though it makes my job harder. I only want to make life easier for them, but I will say that sometimes working with people is very frustrating because they keep going back to the old thing that does not work and they don’t try the new thing. So, sometimes I need reinforcement from my friends and from my Teachers as well. My Teachers operate on a different scale, let us say. I am their manifestation. This is very hard to understand here in the world, and it is not even important. After all, what mystical cosmology has ever gotten anyone through the day? Therefore, God does not need to be understood, but God can be experienced. That is enough.</p>
<p>如果人们不成长，这对我来说不是问题，尽管它使我的工作更难。我只想让他们的生命更轻松，但我要说的是，有时和人们一起工作是非常令人沮丧的，因为他们总是回到不起作用的旧事物中，而不去尝试新事物。因此，有时我需要从我的朋友和我的老师那里得到加强。我的老师在一个不同的规模上运作，我们可以说。我就是他们的表现。在这个世界上，这很难理解，而且这甚至不重要。毕竟，什么神秘的宇宙论曾经让人度过了一天？因此，上帝不需要被理解，但上帝可以被经历。这就足够了。</p>
<p>Most people want God to be someone around in case something goes wrong, like Mommy at home. Well, when you go out and play, you don’t want anything to do with Mommy, but you want to make sure that if you fall down and hurt yourself, you can always go home to Mom. Mom is always there.</p>
<p>大多数人都希望上帝是身边的人，以防出错，比如家里的妈妈。好吧，当你出去玩的时候，你不想和妈妈有任何关系，但你想确保如果你摔倒了，伤到了自己，你可以随时回家找妈妈。妈妈总是在那里。</p>
<p>So, you must see religion in a new way. I want to talk about what it really is and not what people have made out of it. What people have made out of it is not what it really is. Therefore, if you want to carry a new vision into life, you must be prepared for what people will do with it. That is why there must be very little personal investment involved because someone will use it for harm. That does not mean that you have failed. It just means that you must not tamper with the gift once it has been given.</p>
<p>所以，你必须以一种新的方式看待宗教。我想谈的是它的真实面目，而不是人们对它的理解。人们对宗教的理解并不是它真正的样子。因此，如果你想把一个新的远见带入生活，你必须准备好人们将如何对待它。这就是为什么必须有很少的个人投资参与，因为有人会用它来伤害。这并不意味着你失败了。它只是意味着，一旦礼物被给予，你就不能篡改它。</p>
<p>Achievement has two different realms: There is achievement in the Mystery, and there is achievement in the manifestation. Achievement in the Mystery is always enhancing the quality of relationships. It is always a greater experience of communication or shared identity. That in itself has tremendous bearing on achievement in the manifest world, because Mystery is always influencing the manifestation.</p>
<p>成就有两个不同的境界。有在神秘中的成就，也有在显现中的成就。神秘中的成就总是提高关系的质量。它总是一种更大的交流或共同身份的经历。这本身就对显现世界的成就有巨大的影响，因为神秘总是在影响着显现。</p>
<p>Most people are concentrated on achievement in the manifest world, and that is good because that needs to happen, too. They carry out whatever has happened in their realm of relationship. Whenever you are inspired by anything, you are experiencing a greater capacity for relationship in that moment.</p>
<p>大多数人都集中在显现世界的成就上，这很好，因为这也需要发生。他们执行在他们的关系领域里发生的任何事情。每当你受到任何启发，你就在那一刻经历到更大的关系能力。</p>
<p>If you want to stop experiencing Mystery, create a definition for it. Hold to that definition and the door will shut. Then you will experience your definition and not the Mystery, and you will defend your position and the Mystery will be lost to you. The problem here is that people base their identity on their assumptions and not on real experience. Knowledge is always taking you beyond your assumptions, but if your identity is based upon your assumptions, that is too frightening.</p>
<p>如果你想停止经历神秘感，就为它创建一个定义。坚持这个定义，门就会关闭。然后你将经历你的定义，而不是神秘，你将捍卫你的立场，而神秘将被你丢失。这里的问题是，人们把他们的身份建立在他们的假设上，而不是建立在真实的经历上。内识总是带你超越你的假设，但如果你的身份是基于你的假设，那就太可怕了。</p>
<p>Why do people not want to experience God? Why is there that profound resistance? It is because they are afraid to challenge their idea of themselves. Maybe they are not who they think they are. Can they live with that? God gives something much better, but people are afraid to give up what they have created for themselves. I’m not talking about your giving up your car and living like a monk. That’s ridiculous! What people are afraid of giving up is their ideas about themselves. That is true renunciation! True renunciation is not giving up worldly things. It is giving up ideas. They are the bars on your prison.</p>
<p>为什么人们不愿意经历上帝？为什么会有那么深刻的抵触？这是因为他们害怕挑战他们对自己的想法。也许他们不是他们认为的那个人。他们能忍受这样的生活吗？上帝赐予了更好的东西，但人们却害怕放弃他们为自己创造的东西。我不是在说你放弃你的汽车，像和尚一样生活。那是很荒谬的!人们害怕放弃的是他们对自己的想法。那才是真正的放弃!真正的放弃不是放弃世俗的东西。它是放弃想法。它们是你监狱上的栅栏。</p>
<p>To give up ideas you must be willing to be without ideas for awhile until you can find something new. Your security must be based upon something else. Knowledge is your foundation no matter what you believe. What you believe will determine how much you can experience your foundation, but Knowledge is still your foundation. When you know that this is your foundation, then you will progress very rapidly because you will not be afraid of new information. You will not be afraid of new experiences. You will not be afraid to find out new things. And the more you find out, the more you will give because that is natural.</p>
<p>要放弃想法，你必须愿意暂时没有想法，直到你能找到新的东西。你的安全必须建立在其他东西上。无论你相信什么，内识都是你的基础。你相信什么将决定你能在多大程度上经历你的基础，但内识仍然是你的基础。当你知道这是你的基础，那么你的进步就会非常快，因为你不会害怕新的信息。你将不会害怕新的经历。你将不害怕发现新的东西。你发现的越多，你就会给予的越多，因为那是自然的。</p>
<p>I will tell you something. Because I have been talking about Mystery, I will tell you something that throws you back into Mystery: The way it really is, it’s even beyond love. It’s even better than that!</p>
<p>我将告诉你一些事情。因为我一直在谈论神秘，我将告诉你一些事情，把你扔回神秘中。它真正的方式，甚至超越了爱。它甚至比那还要好!</p>
<p>We talk about God as an attraction, as a force that is moving you and stimulating your Knowledge. Think about the Mystery in your life in this way. Mystery is a living Spiritual Presence. It is something you are either aware of in your life or not. Think of religion as a Mystery and not as a philosophy or a political movement so that you can gain access to it within yourself. People create churches because they want to create an opportunity to have an experience. When the Mystery is present, then you will know that God is in the world.</p>
<p>我们把上帝说成是一种吸引力，说成是一种推动你、刺激你内识的力量。以这种方式思考你生命中的神秘。神秘是一种持续的精神临在。它是你在生命中意识到或没有意识到的东西。把宗教看成是一种神秘，而不是一种哲学或政治运动，这样你就能在自己的内心获得它。人们创建教堂是因为他们想创造一个机会来获得经历。当神秘出现时，你就会知道上帝在这个世界上。</p>
