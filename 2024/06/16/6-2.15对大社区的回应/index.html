<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 10, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年4月10日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is necessary when speaking about Greater Community influences to talk about how the mind responds. The mind is designed to act and to interact with the environment. It is both a generator of information and stimulation and a receiver of these as well. The mind naturally engages with the mental and physical environments in such a way that it is constantly sending and receiving information. The mind is not the master of the environment, nor is the environment the master of the mind in a truly balanced and harmonious state. When this state is disturbed, however, imbalances result, which create distortions in experience, in recognition, in processes of thinking and in the conclusions that are derived.</p>
<p>在谈到大社区的影响时，有必要谈一谈心灵如何回应。心灵的设计是为了与环境互动。它既是信息和刺激的产生者，也是这些信息和刺激的接收者。心灵自然地与心理和物理环境打交道，它不断地发送和接收信息。在真正平衡与和谐的状态中，心灵并非环境的主宰，环境也不是心灵的主宰。然而，当这种状态被干扰时，就会产生不平衡，这会导致体验、认知、思维过程以及从中得出的结论出现扭曲。</p>
<p>In order for your mind to function naturally and harmoniously, it must have a dynamic and harmonious relationship with the environment. This, of course, is an ideal state and is not achieved when the mind is not in harmony with itself. When the mind is not in harmony with itself, it experiences its own imbalance and the imbalances in its environment as well. Here it will produce imbalance and discord and respond to what it produces. This creates a vicious cycle in which the mind produces experiences and then responds to its own creations. Rarely is it aware of what it is producing.</p>
<p>为了使你的心灵自然和谐地运作，它必须与环境有一个动态的和谐关系。当然，这是一种理想状态，当心灵与自身不和谐时，是无法实现的。当心灵与自身不和谐时，它就会体验到自身的不平衡，以及环境中的不平衡。在这里，它将产生不平衡与不和谐，并对它产生的状态作出回应。这将导致一个恶性循环，心灵产生体验，然后对自己的创造作出反应。心灵很少意识到自己产生了什么。</p>
<p>This discordance generates a force in the world, a force of dissonance. For instance, if you are troubled, concerned or very fearful about something, or if you are very angry or resentful, you will create a dissonance in your environment. Once this dissonance leaves your own mind, it becomes a force in the environment. Now, if only one person is generating this, it will be a very weak force and easily dissipated. However, if many people are generating these kinds of experiences, they will create a force that is more lasting and much more potent and effective. This force, then, can influence other minds in such a way that it seems to overtake them. A mental force in the environment can become very concentrated and quite strong and can have, so to speak, a whirlwind effect on other minds. Indeed, if you recall the times that you have entered somebody’s personal domain and you walked into a discordant state, you will recall how powerful this can be and how it can affect you emotionally and determine your responses.</p>
<p>这种不和谐在世界中产生了一种力量，一种不和谐的力量。例如，如果你对某件事情感到困扰、担忧或非常恐惧，或者你非常愤怒或怨恨，你会在你的环境中产生不和谐。一旦这种不和谐离开你自己的心灵，它就会成为环境中的一种力量。现在，如果只有一个人在产生这种力量，它将是一种非常微弱的力量，很容易被消散。然而，如果很多人都产生了这种体验，他们将创造出一种更持久、更有力、更有效的力量。那么，这种力量可以影响其他的心灵，以至于它似乎超越了他们。环境中的一种心理力量可以变得非常集中和相当强大，可以说是对其他心灵产生旋风般的影响。事实上，如果你回忆一下你进入某人的个人领域，而你走进了一个不和谐的状态，你会想起这可能是多么强大的力量，以及它如何影响你的情绪并决定你的反应。</p>
<p>Therefore, a discordant mind has an impact on the environment. Once this discordance enters the environment, especially if it is shared by others, it creates a force that has an impact on other minds. Human beings are not aware of the power of their own emotions or the effect of their thinking upon others. Though there are some obvious examples of this, its overall effect and the kinds of interactions that can be generated as a result are rarely, if ever, consciously accounted for.</p>
<p>因此，不和谐的心灵会对环境产生影响。一旦这种不和谐进入环境，特别是如果它被其他人分享，它就会产生一种力量，对其他心灵产生影响。人类不知道自己的情绪的力量，也不知道自己的思维对他人的影响。虽然有一些明显的例子，但它的整体效果和因此而产生的各种互动很少，如果有的话，也是有意识的。</p>
<p>Cultivating a good mental environment around you personally is very, very important. You generate this environment and you live within it. If you generate a hostile, discordant environment, you will live within that. So focused can this environment become and so effective in determining your own experience that it is like living in a shell, where the rain seems to fall upon you and no one else. But the effect on others can be very great as well, especially if you are in close proximity to them. When you are out of doors, the effect of your thinking is more generally dissipated, and the reaction of those who feel its effects will not be as great. That is because it represents a large mental environment that is subject to many other forces beyond human forces alone. But if you are indoors with another or in very close proximity, then the impact can be tremendous. That is why, if you are engaging with someone who is in a very discordant state and it is having a damaging effect upon you or making it difficult for you to think clearly, it is always a good idea to try to get them out of doors so that their mental projections can be dissipated more effectively. This will lessen the impact upon you to a certain degree.</p>
<p>在你个人周围培养一个良好的心理环境是非常非常重要的。你产生这个环境，你就生活在这个环境中。如果你产生一个敌对的、不和谐的环境，你将生活在其中。这种环境会变得如此集中，在决定你自己的体验方面如此有效，就像生活在一个壳里，雨似乎只落在你的身上，没有落在其他人的身上。但对其他人的影响也可能非常巨大，特别是如果你和他们距离很接近。当你在门外时，你思维的影响会更普遍地消散，而那些感受到其影响的人的回应也不会那么大。这是因为它代表了一个广阔的心理环境，受到许多其他力量的影响，而不仅仅是人的力量。但是，如果你在室内与另一个人在一起，或者在非常接近的地方，那么影响可能是巨大的。这就是为什么，如果你和一个处于非常不和谐状态的人打交道，并且它对你产生了破坏性的影响，或者使你难以清晰地思考，那么尝试把他们带出门外总是一个好主意，这样他们的心理投射可以更有效地消散。这将在一定程度上减少对你的影响。</p>
<p>So powerful is your interaction with others that you must be very careful with whom you associate. If you are to associate intentionally with someone who is in a very discordant state or who is very disturbed or conflicted, you must be well prepared for this because the impact upon you will be great. People will naturally gravitate to those who can help them experience a positive mental environment. This is especially true for people who are undertaking the reclamation of Knowledge and are attempting to become aware of their own mental state and its impact on the environment as well as the environment’s impact upon them.</p>
<p>你与他人的互动是如此强大，以至于你必须非常小心与谁交往。如果你有意与处于非常不和谐的状态或非常不安或冲突的人交往，你必须对此有充分的准备，因为对你的影响会很大。人们会自然而然地倾向于那些能够帮助他们体验积极心理环境的人。对于那些正在进行内识开垦，并试图意识到自己的心理状态及其对环境的影响以及环境对他们的影响的人来说，这一点尤其正确。</p>
<p>Many people fear that the environment has ultimate power over them, and others believe, but rarely experience, that they have ultimate power over the environment. Neither, of course, is true because you are in dynamic relationship with the environment. Just as your body thrives on the resources of your environment and interacts with these resources continuously, your mind—your brain and all of its functions—and Knowledge, the mind beyond the brain which accounts for more refined qualities of thinking and evaluation, exist within the mental environment, thrive upon its resources and interact with it continuously as well.</p>
<p>许多人担心环境对他们有最终的力量，而其他人则相信，但很少经历，他们对环境有最终的力量。当然，两者都不是真的，因为你与环境是动态的关系。就像你的身体在环境的资源中茁壮成长并与这些资源不断互动一样，你的心灵——你的心智和它的所有功能——以及内识——超越心灵的思考，它负责更精细的思考和评估质量，存在于心理环境中，在它的资源中茁壮成长并与它不断互动。</p>
<p>Individuals who are in the process of reclaiming their Knowledge will seek to create a positive mental environment. They will naturally do this to create an upward spiral instead of a downward spiral. They will become much more sensitive to those with whom they are engaged and to what transpires in these interactions. They will want to seek freedom and reprieve from stressful situations unless these situations are necessary. They will seek greater equanimity and more quiet times. All of their values and inclinations will change accordingly.</p>
<p>处于重新获得内识过程中的人将寻求创造一个积极的心理环境。他们自然会这样做，以创造一个向上的螺旋，而不是一个向下的螺旋。他们会对与之交往的人以及这些交往中发生的事情变得更加敏感。他们会想寻求自由，并从紧张的情况下缓和下来，除非这些情况是必要的。他们将寻求更大的平静和更多的安静时间。他们所有的价值观和倾向都会相应地改变。</p>
<p>Before this happens, people seek to create an environment that is agreeable to their beliefs, so they surround themselves with people who generally will accept their viewpoint and will confirm their prejudices. But when you are entering a more conscious state, a state more committed to education and revelation, then you will seek an environment that is more conducive to the experience of awareness and knowing. This is a natural process, and it will become greatly accelerated as you become aware of it and can make conscious decisions in order to enhance your mental environment and to create greater opportunities for insight.</p>
<p>在这之前，人们寻求创造一个认同他们信仰的环境，所以他们周围的人一般会接受他们的观点，并确认他们的偏见。但是当你进入一个更有意识的状态，一个更致力于教育和启示的状态，那么你会寻求一个更有利于经历觉知和知道的环境。这是一个自然的过程，当你意识到这一点，并能做出有意识的决定，以提高你的心理环境，为洞察力创造更大的机会时，这个过程将大大加快。</p>
<p>Many people seek to be out of doors because it is a freer mental environment than when they are confined with other people. Here people seek communion with nature because nature provides a freer and often more conducive mental environment for introspection and for insight into the behavior and interaction of others. Some seek nature purely as a relief.</p>
<p>许多人寻求走出家门，因为这比他们与其他人关在一起时有更自由的心理环境。在这里，人们寻求与大自然的交流，因为大自然提供了一个更自由、通常更有利于内省和洞察他人行为和互动的心理环境。有些人寻求自然纯粹是一种解脱。</p>
<p>When you begin to concentrate on the mental environment, you realize how absolutely it impacts your sense of well-being and how important it is for your development. This is the beginning of becoming aware of the mental environment. As this is undertaken in a conscious and intentional way, you begin to become aware of the influences that are affecting your emotional states and your thinking. Should you undertake the reclamation of Knowledge according to the Greater Community Tradition, then you will need to develop stillness, focused thinking, objectivity, discernment and observation—all things that generate a more focused and powerful mind, a mind that has a greater impact on its environment and upon the experiences of others as well.</p>
<p>当你开始专注于心理环境时，你会意识到它对你的幸福感有多么绝对的影响，以及它对你的发展有多么重要。这是意识到心理环境的开始。当你有意识地、有目的地进行这项工作时，你就会开始意识到影响你情绪状态和思维的因素。如果你根据大社区传统进行内识的开垦，那么你将需要发展静心、集中思考、客观性、辨别力和观察力——所有这些都会产生一个更集中和强大的心智，一个对环境和其他人的经历有更大影响的心灵。</p>
<p>With Knowledge as your guide, your personal mind will have the environment and the stimulation for true development, which will produce great benefits for you and for others. Here you can make a positive overall contribution to the mental environment. This is quite true. Knowledge is a very pervasive kind of influence. You cannot trace its impact on others, nor can you follow the direction in which it will travel, whom it will contact and how they will respond. But perhaps you can accept on faith that the world is progressing because of the contribution of many concentrated individuals who are dedicated to the well-being of humanity and to its advancement as a race. The benefits you see in the world are the result of this contribution, not just practical and physical benefits, but the concentration of many minds on the well-being and equanimity of human function and interaction. They are caring for the mental environment like one who cares for a great forest, looking after it with loving attention, giving it a remedy when that is possible and protecting it from outside influences.</p>
<p>有了内识作为指导，你的个人心智将拥有真实发展的环境和刺激，这将对你和他人产生巨大的好处。在这里，你可以为心理环境做出积极的整体贡献。这是很正确的。内识是一种非常普遍的影响。你无法追踪它对他人的影响，也无法跟踪它的传播方向，它将与谁接触，他们将如何回应。但是，也许你可以在信仰上接受这样的事实：世界正在进步，因为许多专注于人类福祉和作为一个种族的进步的个人做出了贡献。你在这个世界上看到的好处是这种贡献的结果，不仅仅是实际的和物质的好处，而是许多人的心灵集中在人类功能和互动的福祉和平和上。他们对心理环境的关心就像一个人对大森林的关心一样，用爱的目光照顾它，在可能的时候给它一个补救措施，保护它不受外界影响。</p>
<p>Now I must speak of the Greater Community influences that are affecting humanity at this time. If you can begin, at least conceptually, to see that you live in the mental environment and that you are in continuous and dynamic interaction with it, it is then necessary for you to think of the kinds of influences that exist in that environment—influences that you may welcome, accept and promote and influences that are in your life inadvertently, without your invitation, as part of the environment in which you function. The impact of television, music and radio is very, very great on the human mind, so great that students of Knowledge will seek to limit these influences and screen them conscientiously. These are influences that are part of the environment in which you function. You don’t necessarily welcome them, but they are a part of your environment and will have an impact upon you nonetheless.</p>
<p>现在我必须谈谈此时正在影响人类的大社区的影响。如果你能开始，至少在概念上，看到你生活在心理环境中，你与它处于持续和动态的互动中，那么你就有必要思考存在于该环境中的各种影响——你可能欢迎、接受和促进的影响，以及在你的生命的无意中，未经你邀请，作为你运作环境的一部分的影响。电视、音乐和广播对人类心智的影响非常、非常大，大到内识的学生会设法限制这些影响，并有意识地筛选它们。这些影响是你所处环境的一部分。你不一定欢迎它们，但它们是你环境的一部分，还是会对你产生影响。</p>
<p>There are influences that you are barely aware of that are also casting a strong influence upon you, particularly if you are sensitive to the Greater Community. Your sensitivity to the Greater Community is determined by your background—not simply your history as a human being in this life, but your background far beyond that as well. You carry your accumulated learning with you into the experience of life that you are having now as a single human being. If this accumulated learning accounts for the Greater Community, then you will be especially sensitive to Greater Community influences. This is part of your make-up. You cannot change this, but you can learn to become aware of it and to deal with it effectively so that in time, as your mind becomes stronger and more focused through preparation and right association with others, you can learn not only to offset damaging or discordant influences, either within human situations or from influences that extend beyond human awareness, but in time to have a positive influence on them as well.</p>
<p>还有一些你几乎没有意识到的影响，也对你产生了强烈的影响，特别是如果你对大社区敏感的话。你对大社区的敏感度是由你的背景决定的——不仅仅是你今生作为一个人的历史，还有你的背景，远远超出这个范围。你带着你积累的内识进入你现在作为一个人的生命经历。如果这种积累的学习占了大社区的地位，那么你将对大社区的影响特别敏感。这是你构成的一部分。你无法改变这一点，但你可以学会意识到它，并有效地处理它，这样，随着时间的推移，你的心智通过准备和与他人的正确联系变得更加强大和集中，你不仅可以学会抵消破坏性或不和谐的影响，无论是在人类的情况下还是从超出人类意识的影响中，而且及时对它们产生积极影响。</p>
<p>Consider this: A strong mind will always influence a weaker mind. A strong mind can to a certain degree control a weaker mind. This happens even if the stronger person is not trying to cast an influence or persuade anyone to do anything. The fact that his or her mind is more concentrated and less conflicted, with greater intention and self-determination, will have an impact upon other minds that are less focused and less concentrated. This is a fact of life and cannot be avoided. When people begin to compete with each other, they realize in time that they must have an increased level of concentration and focus and very specific forms of preparation, which are determined by what they are attempting to undertake. Clearly, in all cases they must become stronger, more focused and wiser in their decisions. This is stimulated because human beings compete with each other for certain advantages in life. This competition can be healthy, but it can be damaging as well.</p>
<p>考虑到这一点。一个强大的心智总是会影响一个较弱的心智。一个强大的心灵可以在一定程度上控制一个较弱的心灵。即使强者没有试图施加影响或说服任何人做任何事情，也会发生这种情况。他或她的心智更集中，冲突更少，有更大的意图和自我决定权，这一事实将对其他不太集中和不太集中的心智产生影响。这是生活中的一个事实，是无法避免的。当人们开始相互竞争时，他们会及时意识到，他们必须有更高的注意力和专注度，以及非常具体的准备形式，这是由他们试图进行的事情决定的。显然，在所有情况下，他们必须变得更强大，更专注，更明智地作出决定。这是因为人类为了生活中的某些优势而相互竞争，所以才会受到刺激。这种竞争可能是健康的，但也可能是有害的。</p>
<p>Now that Greater Community presences are active in the world, you are dealing with a set of influences with which you cannot effectively compete, and that is why the preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is being presented. Only a preparation from beyond the world can be effective in teaching you to engage with influences from beyond the world.</p>
<p>现在，大社区的存在活跃在这个世界上，你正在处理一系列的影响，你无法有效地与之竞争，这就是为什么大社区内识之路中的准备被提出来。只有来自世界之外的准备才能有效地教你与来自世界之外的影响者打交道。</p>
<p>Now let me speak about how the Greater Community influences can affect the human mind. First of all, if there is a visitation occurring, those who are undertaking the visitation will want to create a force field around their presence which will hopefully have a predetermined effect on human beings. Human beings have been studied for a very long time—at least in terms of their behavior and their predispositions. Therefore, the visitors will want to create a certain influence in the environment in order to have a desired impact upon anyone whom they might encounter, either intentionally or inadvertently. Should they wish to investigate individuals directly, the visitors will, in a sense, hypnotize them. That is perhaps the best word that can be used in this situation. They will suspend people’s conscious minds and then suggest things to them that they will then tend to accept as their own. People will then forget where the suggestions came from. This makes it easier to affect people’s behavior and to bring about a desired, predetermined set of actions. Human beings have been doing this to one another since the beginning of their existence in the world, but they are not masterful at this.</p>
<p>现在让我谈谈大社区的影响如何影响人类的心智。首先，如果有探访发生，那些进行探访的种族将想在他们的存在周围创造一个力场，希望能对人类产生预定的影响。人类已经被研究了很长时间，至少在他们的行为和他们的倾向性方面。因此，来访者希望在环境中创造某种影响，以便对他们可能遇到的任何人产生预期的影响，无论是有意的还是无意的。如果他们想直接调查个人，从某种意义上说，来访者将对他们进行催眠。这也许是在这种情况下可以使用的最好的词。他们会暂停人们的意识，然后向他们建议一些事情，然后他们会倾向于接受为自己的事情。然后人们会忘记这些建议来自哪里。这样就更容易影响人们的行为，并带来一套预期的、预先确定的行动。自从人类存在于这个世界上以来，人类就一直在对彼此这样做，但他们在这方面并不精通。</p>
<p>There are Forces of Dissonance from beyond the world that are visiting the world. They are not coming here on your behalf. They are adept in certain ways at manipulating the mental environment. To affect and influence the behavior and the recognition of those whom they might encounter, particularly if they wish to study the thinking, behavior or biology of their subjects, they will use these skills to whatever extent they feel it is possible. There are increasing numbers of individuals who have been affected by these Forces directly, and they are deeply disturbed and distressed by the encounters that they have had, if they are aware of them at all. They wonder how their memory could be so suspended, how their evaluations could be so blotted out and how their recollections can seem so vague. Think, then, of the idea of hypnosis and remember that a more concentrated mind will by nature have a greater impact on a weaker mind than the weaker mind can have on the more concentrated mind.</p>
<p>有一些来自世界之外的不和谐力量正在访问这个世界。他们不是代表你们来这里的。他们善于用某些方式来操纵心理环境。为了影响和影响他们可能遇到的人的行为和认知，特别是如果他们想研究其对象的思维、行为或生物学，他们会在他们认为可能的程度上使用这些技能。有越来越多的人直接受到这些力量的影响，他们对自己的遭遇深感不安和痛苦，如果他们能意识到这些遭遇的话。他们想知道自己的记忆怎么会如此暂停，自己的评价怎么会如此被抹去，自己的回忆怎么会显得如此模糊。那么，想想催眠的想法，并记住，从本质上讲，一个更集中的心智对一个较弱的心智的影响会比较弱的心智对更集中的心智的影响更大。</p>
<p>Therefore, understand that human beings are being studied, even examined, by Forces of Dissonance from beyond the world. This is unfortunate because humanity is ill prepared for this. Yet, it does hold certain opportunities for development if the situation can be clearly understood. Competition can engender creativity, responsibility, resourcefulness and self-determination. You are competing in your mental environment now with intelligent forces from beyond the world. This is a fact; you cannot avoid it. It would be foolish to deny it or pretend that it is not occurring. This, then, is a form of competition. You are competing for control of your world; you are competing for control of your own life; you are competing for who in the future will dominate the world. Does this sound too grave? Does this sound too foreboding or too ominous to consider? Perhaps at first it might seem like this, but if you think about it carefully and are willing to consider it further, you will see that this is the kind of involvement that humanity needs in order to generate harmony within the human family and to create a greater focus and incentive for learning. That is not to say the Forces of Dissonance are intentionally helping you by their interference in human affairs, but it is to say that the situation does offer some extremely important opportunities and incentives for development.</p>
<p>因此，要明白，人类正在被来自世界之外的不和谐力量研究，甚至是检查。这是很不幸的，因为人类对此准备不足。然而，如果能够清楚地理解这种情况，它确实蕴含着某些发展的机会。竞争可以产生创造力、责任感、足智多谋和自我决定。你现在正在你的心理环境中与来自世界之外的智慧力量竞争。这是一个事实；你无法回避它。如果否认它或假装它没有发生，那将是愚蠢的。那么，这就是一种竞争的形式。你在为控制你们的世界而竞争；你在为控制你自己的生命而竞争；你在为谁将在未来主宰世界而竞争。这听起来是不是太严重了？这听起来是不是太不吉利或不详，不值得考虑？也许一开始看起来是这样，但如果你仔细想一想，愿意进一步考虑，你就会发现，这正是人类需要的参与，以便在人类大家庭中产生和谐，并为学习创造更大的焦点和动力。这并不是说”不和谐力量”通过对人类事务的干预而有意帮助你们，而是说这种情况确实提供了一些极其重要的发展机会和激励。</p>
<p>You cannot change the events that are occurring, but you can interpret them wisely and learn to use them to your advantage. To do this, you must reconsider where you stand in life, what you have accomplished and what you have not accomplished. You must consider the impact of your own thinking and consider as well the environments in which you place yourself, either intentionally or inadvertently. This creates greater self-awareness, discernment and conscientiousness—all of which are necessary if you are to progress as a human being.</p>
<p>你无法改变正在发生的事件，但你可以明智地解释它们，并学会利用它们为你服务。要做到这一点，你必须重新考虑你在生命中的位置，你已经完成了什么，你还没有完成什么。你必须考虑你自己思维的影响，也要考虑你有意或无意地将自己置于其中的环境。这将创造出更大的自我意识、辨别力和自觉性——如果你要作为一个人进步，所有这些都是必要的。</p>
<p>Consider this: If you come in proximity to a force from the Greater Community, you will begin to react very strongly. Usually people feel a tremendous sense of avoidance, a desire to leave, to get away, to find refuge. There is often a tremendous sense of anxiety. This is a normal response, but other responses are possible depending upon the temperament and nature of the person involved. There are places in the world where people do not want to go. They feel uncomfortable there. There are places in nature that people pass by or avoid intentionally. They feel uncomfortable there. This is not to say that all these places contain Greater Community influences, but you can see how easy it is for those from the Greater Community to establish themselves in the world and to be relatively free of human scrutiny. So powerful can manipulation of the mental environment be here that even the curious or the adventuresome can easily be dissuaded.</p>
<p>考虑一下这个问题。如果你接近一个来自大社区的力量，你会开始有非常强烈的反应。通常人们会有一种巨大的回避感，渴望离开，逃离，寻找庇护。往往有一种巨大的焦虑感。这是一种正常的反应，但其他反应也是可能的，这取决于当事人的脾气和性质。世界上有一些地方是人们不想去的。他们在那里感到不舒服。自然界中有一些地方，人们路过或有意避开。他们在那里感到不舒服。这并不是说所有这些地方都含有大社区的影响，但你可以看到来自大社区的人是多么容易在这个世界上建立自己的地位，并相对不受人类的审查。在这里，对心理环境的操纵是如此强大，甚至连好奇心和冒险家都很容易被劝阻。</p>
<p>Until individuals gain an objective overview of their experience, which they can only do with Knowledge as their counsel, guide and foundation, they will be influenced. They will follow their own feelings and will be governed by the predominant ideas that they hold. Ideas can be injected into other minds. Feelings can be motivated by certain kinds of stimulation. Human beings are not so terribly complex that these things cannot be planned and executed with great intention and effectiveness. People will not know why they are responding the way they are. Perhaps they will give themselves reasons, but having reasons does not mean that one understands the situation or the influences at hand.</p>
<p>在个人获得对其经验的客观概述之前，他们只能以内识作为其咨询、指导和基础，他们会受到影响。他们会跟随自己的感觉，并被自己所持有的主导想法所支配。想法可以被注入其他的头脑。感情可以被某些类型的刺激所激发。人类并没有复杂到不能有意和有效地计划和执行这些事情的程度。人们不会知道为什么他们会有这样的反应。也许他们会给自己找理由，但有理由并不意味着一个人理解情况或手头的影响因素。</p>
<p>If people are unstable psychologically, they will become more unstable around a Greater Community influence. They can even be driven to insanity. This is not because the Greater Community influence seeks to make them so. It is simply that when you are around a more powerful mind, it will accentuate your present state. In other words, you will become more extreme in your own behavior. This is one of the reasons why the man and woman of Knowledge must remain hidden from the world and must be very judicious about whom they encounter and what they communicate because they will have a great impact on everyone they meet. The unwise will become more unwise around them, and those seeking Wisdom will become wiser, for the more concentrated mind will accentuate the present state of every other mind that it comes in contact with. That is one reason why the Wise withdraw. This is very necessary.</p>
<p>如果人们的心理不稳定，在大社区的影响下，他们会变得更加不稳定。他们甚至会被逼得精神错乱。这并不是因为大社区的影响试图使他们如此。只是当你在一个更强大的心智周围时，它将突出你当下的状态。换句话说，你会在自己的行为中变得更加极端。这就是为什么内识的男人和女人必须远离世界，必须对他们遇到的人和他们交流的内容非常谨慎的原因之一，因为他们会对他们遇到的每个人产生很大的影响。不明智的人在他们周围会变得更不明智，而那些寻求智慧的人则会变得更明智，因为更集中的心灵会强调它所接触到的每一个其他心灵的现状。这就是智者退出的一个原因。这是很有必要的。</p>
<p>Our emphasis here is to reinforce your understanding that you live in a mental environment and that you are subject to influences within that environment. Influences from the Greater Community are present here. They are not everywhere, but they are in certain places and their numbers are not small. Not only are they having an influence on human thinking and behavior, they are using human thinking and behavior, testing it, experimenting with it, learning how it functions and practicing in its manipulation. This is occurring, like it or not, accept it or not. It is occurring. It is better to accept it, to face it and to learn how to counteract it and to affect it yourself, for if you do not affect it, it will in time affect you increasingly.</p>
<p>我们在这里强调的是加强你的理解，你生活在一个心理环境中，你会受到这个环境中的影响。来自大社区的影响在这里存在。他们不是无处不在，但他们在某些地方，而且数量不小。他们不仅对人类的思维和行为产生影响，他们还在利用人类的思维和行为，测试它，用它做实验，学习它如何运作，并在操纵它方面进行练习。这正在发生，不管你喜不喜欢，接不接受。它正在发生。最好是接受它，面对它，学习如何抵制它，自己影响它，因为如果你不影响它，它就会越来越影响你。</p>
<p>There are some people in the world who have such a strong Greater Community background that they feel the influence of Greater Community forces, even those forces that are far away and not in their immediate proximity. They react emotionally to these things and they cannot account for their own experiences. They say to themselves, “My God! Why am I feeling the way I am feeling?” Perhaps they have unexplained feelings of dread or anxiety that cannot be explained in terms of their current circumstances. Sometimes these people blame themselves greatly for these experiences and try to repress them or escape from them. Others blame society at large or the political climate in which they live, but still they cannot account for their range of experience. This certainly does not happen with every person, but with certain people it is quite pronounced. These people will need to learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge if they are to gain access to the source of their own experience.</p>
<p>世界上有一些人有如此强烈的大社区背景，以至于他们能感受到大社区力量的影响，即使是那些远在天边、不在他们身边的力量。他们对这些事情有情绪化的反应，他们无法解释自己的经历。他们对自己说：”我的上帝！为什么我会有这样的感觉？为什么我有这种感觉？”也许他们有无法解释的恐惧或焦虑的感觉，无法用他们目前的环境来解释。有时，这些人对这些体验非常自责，并试图压抑它们或逃避它们。其他人则指责整个社会或他们所处的政治气候，但他们仍然无法解释他们的一系列经历。这当然不是发生在每个人身上，但对于某些人来说，这种情况是相当明显的。这些人需要学习大社区内识之路，如果他们要获得自己经历的来源。</p>
<p>To learn the source of your experience, you must learn the influences that are stimulating it, affecting it and in some cases even generating it. You must learn to engage with the environment responsibly and consciously. This means you recognize the nature and the effects of your own thinking and learn to discern those influences that are affecting you directly. To a certain extent, you can control your exposure to influences in the mental environment. And certainly as your skill and awareness grow, you will become more effective in this. This is a requirement for education.</p>
<p>要学习你的经验的来源，你必须学习刺激它、影响它、甚至在某些情况下产生它的影响因素。你必须学会负责任地、有意识地与环境接触。这意味着你要认识到你自己思维的性质和影响，并学会辨别那些直接影响你的影响因素。在某种程度上，你可以控制你在心理环境中的影响。当然，随着你的技能和意识的增长，你会在这方面变得更加有效。这是教育的一个要求。</p>
<p>There have always been problems in the mental environment with human beings because their mental and spiritual lives are not united. But there are greater problems now because of the Greater Community presence in the world. These problems can generate important solutions, but they are problems that are very difficult for people to recognize and to accept. Let us give you this idea to consider: The Forces of Dissonance in the world, which by the way are not the only Greater Community forces in the world, are able to move about quite effectively without human recognition in many cases, not because they are invisible, not because they are spiritual forces—they are physical forces—but because they can influence the mind that perceives them. How can this be, you ask? Well, if a more concentrated mind wills or wishes that the less concentrated not recognize it, then in most cases the person with the weaker mind will not recognize the presence of the more concentrated mind.</p>
<p>人类的心理环境一直存在问题，因为他们的心理生活和精神生活没有结合起来。但现在有更大的问题，因为大社区在世界的存在。这些问题可以产生重要的解决方案，但这些问题对人们来说是很难认识和接受的。让我们给你这个想法来考虑。世界上的不和谐力量，顺便说一下，并不是世界上唯一的大社区力量，在许多情况下能够在人类不认识的情况下相当有效地活动，不是因为它们看不见，不是因为它们是精神力量——它们是物理力量，而是因为它们能够影响感知它们的心灵。你问，这怎么可能呢？好吧，如果一个更集中的心灵希望或想要不集中的心灵不能识别它，那么在大多数情况下，心智较弱的人将不会认出更集中的心智存在。</p>
<p>Remember, thoughts affect minds. Thoughts affect thinking. Thinking affects thinking. When thinking is affected, certain responses can be predetermined. Because you are only used to interacting with other human beings, these things can sound quite phenomenal, even impossible. But in your mental environment now there are intelligent forces that are not human beings. They are here to collect information. They are here to practice their skills on you for future uses and advantages. This is an unusual and difficult situation that requires an unusual and effective resolution. You cannot use the normal range of human explanation or human response in order to deal effectively with these influences. That is why The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is being presented.</p>
<p>记住，思想会影响心智。思想影响思维。思维影响思维。当思维受到影响时，某些反应就会被预先确定下来。因为你只习惯于与其他人类互动，这些事情听起来相当惊人，甚至不可能。但是在你的心理环境中，现在有不是人类的智慧力量。他们在这里是为了收集信息。他们在这里对你们练习他们的技能，以便将来使用和利用。这是一个不寻常和困难的情况，需要一个不寻常和有效的解决方案。你不能使用人类的正常解释或人类的反应范围，以有效地处理这些影响因素。这就是为什么提出大社区内识之路的原因。</p>
<p>I have mentioned several times in these discourses that there are forces for good in the world as well. They are here for the protection and the benefit of humanity. Therefore, you are not left helpless in the face of a seemingly more powerful adversary. Not only are there Greater Community forces in the world here to assist you and to educate you, there is the power and presence of Knowledge, which must become activated to enable you to effectively deal not only with the problems and dilemmas of human affairs, but the problems and dilemmas that exist in the Greater Community as well.</p>
<p>我在这些论述中曾多次提到，世界上也有善的力量。他在这里是为了保护和造福人类。因此，在面对看似更强大的对手时，你并不是束手无策。世界上不仅有大社区的力量在这里帮助你们，教育你们，还有内识的力量和存在，必须激活它，使你不仅能有效地处理人类事务的问题和困境，而且能有效地处理大社区存在的问题和困境。</p>
<p>Consider this: Human thinking can be directly influenced. Human perception can be directly influenced. Things can be done to people without any forewarning. People can be overtaken and manipulated, and, in fact, this is occurring already. I realize that this is not a popular idea that I am presenting. It is a very sobering one. And yet, because it is a fact in the world now, it is something you must accept. Acceptance is the beginning of education—accepting a deficiency, accepting a problem that needs resolution, accepting your own desire for advancement and accepting that your current state is inadequate for you. These things all provide the incentive for greater education and development.</p>
<p>考虑到这一点。人类的思维可以被直接影响。人类的感知可以被直接影响。事物可以在没有任何预兆的情况下对人们进行。人们可以被超越和操纵，事实上，这已经在发生了。我意识到，我提出的这个想法并不受欢迎。这是一个非常令人清醒的想法。然而，因为它是现在世界上的一个事实，它是你必须接受的事实。接受是教育的开始——接受一个缺陷，接受一个需要解决的问题，接受你自己对进步的渴望，接受你目前的状态对你来说是不够的。这些事情都为更大的教育和发展提供了激励。</p>
<p>Incentive is necessary in order to bring about any accomplishment, yet it must be driven by need. Human beings need to become stronger mentally and more balanced and harmonious within themselves. This is not merely a preference. It cannot merely be some form of entertainment or a pastime or a hobby. It must become central in your priorities. What will make it central in your priorities? The recognition of what is influencing you in your life and your own need for development, resolution and greater equanimity. Need drives progress. Your needs are great. Even if there were no Greater Community influences in the world at this time, your needs are great and are growing greater every day. To meet a great need, you need great incentive. You need great preparation and you need great companions.</p>
<p>为了带来任何成就，激励是必要的，然而它必须由需求驱动。人类需要在心理上变得更强大，在内心更平衡、更和谐。这不仅仅是一种偏好。它不能仅仅是某种形式的娱乐、消遣或爱好。它必须成为你的优先事项中的核心。什么会使它成为你优先事项的中心？认识到什么在你的生命中影响着你，以及你自己对发展、解决和更大的平静的需要。需求推动进步。你的需求是巨大的。即使此时世界上没有大社区的影响，你的需求也是巨大的，而且每天都在增长。为了满足一个巨大的需求，你需要巨大的激励。你需要伟大的准备，你需要伟大的同伴。</p>
<p>The Forces of Dissonance are not trained in the ways of Knowledge. Here you have a possible advantage, should you choose to prepare and should you take your preparation seriously and undertake it with great patience and perseverance. Here is your advantage. That is why we emphasize the development of Knowledge. We do not emphasize it merely so that you will feel better or have a greater sense of purpose in the world or will feel more self-loving and self-accepting. No. Though these are the great rewards in following The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, this teaching and preparation are being called upon now for other real and pressing needs. The Forces for Good from the Greater Community are here to emphasize Knowledge, for this is what will save the human race. The Forces of Dissonance are not educated in The Way of Knowledge or they would not be Forces of Dissonance, for Knowledge cannot oppose itself and must contribute to the welfare and benefit of life everywhere.</p>
<p>不和谐的力量没有经过内识之路的训练。在这里你有一个可能的优势，如果你选择准备，如果你认真对待你的准备并以极大的耐心和毅力进行准备。这里是你的优势。这就是为什么我们强调内识的发展。我们强调它不仅仅是为了让你感觉更好，或者在这个世界上有更大的目的感，或者会感觉更自爱和自我接受。虽然这些都是追随大社区内识之路的巨大回报，但这种教学和准备工作现在正被其他真实而紧迫的需求所召唤。来自大社区的善的力量在这里强调内识，因为这将是拯救人类的东西。不和谐的力量没有接受过内识之路的教育，否则他们就不会成为不和谐的力量，因为内识不能反对自己，必须为各地生命的福利和利益作出贡献。</p>
<p>You may feel powerless in the presence of Greater Community influences, but you have the greater advantage. If you can be prepared in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, then you will have a greater prospect for success. That is why the emphasis is on Knowledge. That is why it is being called upon. It is necessary for your well-being, and it is necessary for your advancement as well.</p>
<p>在大社区的影响面前，你可能会感到无能为力，但你有更大的优势。如果你能在大社区内识之路中做好准备，那么你将有更大的成功前景。这就是为什么要强调内识。这就是为什么它被召唤的原因。它对你的福祉是必要的，对你的进步也是必要的。</p>
<p>There will always be minds more clever and cunning than yours. There will always be technologies more advanced than yours. There will always be minds more concentrated than yours, in the Greater Community that is. But should you undertake and progress in the reclamation of Knowledge, then you will establish a foundation within yourself that cannot be influenced and cannot be corrupted, for Knowledge cannot be influenced by thinking minds. Knowledge cannot be corrupted by the inducements of physical life. Knowledge is without fear, for it is immortal. It cannot be penetrated by the outside world. Only Knowledge can influence Knowledge because it is a spiritual reality which exists within each person in the world. Though it is latent in the vast majority of people, it is there nonetheless to be cultivated and developed. Though the requirements in this cultivation and development are great, it is possible that many may advance. Not everyone has to advance in The Way of Knowledge, but it is vital for certain people, and it is vital for the human race that a sufficient number of people advance in this regard.</p>
<p>总会有比你们更聪明、更狡猾的心智。总会有比你们更先进的技术。总会有比你们更集中的心智，在大社区里就是如此。但是，如果你在开垦内识的过程中进行并取得进展，那么你将在自己内部建立一个不能被影响、不能被腐蚀的基础，因为内识不能被思考的心灵所影响。内识不能被物质生活的诱因所破坏。内识是没有恐惧的，因为它是不朽的。它不能被外部世界所渗透。只有内识能影响内识，因为它是存在于世界上每个人体内的精神现实。虽然它潜伏在绝大多数人的体内，但它仍然存在，需要培养和发展。虽然这种培养和发展的要求很高，但很多人都有可能进步。不是每个人都必须在内识之路上进步，但这对某些人来说是至关重要的，对人类来说，有足够数量的人在这方面进步是至关重要的。</p>
<p>I am speaking now of the future and of the present. No one will take over the human race any time soon. That is not desired, even by those who are studying you now, those who have come from the Greater Community. That is not their mission, but they will study you, influence you and affect you. They will learn how you think, how you behave and how you respond. They will ascertain your weaknesses and limitations, and they will capitalize upon them for their own purposes. This is a detriment to humanity now and will be a detriment in the future.</p>
<p>我现在说的是未来和现在。没有人会在短期内接管人类。那是没有希望的，即使是那些现在正在研究你们的种族，那些来自大社区的种族。这不是他们的任务，但他们将研究你们，影响你们，并感染你们。他们将学习你们的思考方式，你们的行为方式和你们的反应方式。他们将确定你们的弱点和局限性，并为自己的目的利用它们。这对人类现在是一种损害，在未来也将是一种损害。</p>
<p>What can counteract this? The development of the mind and the reclamation of Knowledge. The development of the mind will enable you to perceive, to counteract and to affect the influences which now affect you. But the reclamation of Knowledge will give you Wisdom and true safety, so much so that in time you will have the greater influence, for nothing is a greater influence than Knowledge itself. This is difficult to account for in the world because there are very few individuals who have developed in The Way of Knowledge. Those who have, have had a great influence and a great bearing on the well-being and destiny of humanity. Their examples may be few, but they are very pronounced. You have only to look into your own life and do an objective review to see who has influenced virtue in you. You will find that they are not only people with whom you were directly engaged, but that there are many who have lived long before whose contribution continues to reverberate through human minds everywhere.</p>
<p>什么可以抵制这种情况？心灵的发展和内识的开垦。心灵的发展将使你能够察觉、抵制和影响现在影响你的影响因素。但内识的开垦会给你带来智慧和真实的安全，以至于到时候你会有更大的影响力，因为没有什么比内识本身的影响力更大。这在世界范围内是很难解释的，因为在内识之路上发展起来的人很少。那些人对人类的福祉和命运有很大的影响和作用。他们的例子可能很少，但却非常明显。你只要看看自己的生命，做一个客观的回顾，看看谁在你身上影响了美德。你会发现，他们不仅是与你直接打交道的人，而且有许多人已经活了很久，他们的贡献继续回荡在各地的人类心灵中。</p>
<p>Such is the power of Knowledge. This is your advantage. Claim it for your well-being, and claim it for the well-being of humanity. Claim it for your ability to interact with the Greater Community because it is part of your life now and will become increasingly so, for the world is emerging into the Greater Community and must learn to account for its influences, its powers, its motives and its existence. This means that humanity is emerging into a larger arena of life where there are many forms of influence and many opportunities for development that were unavailable to people before.</p>
<p>这就是内识的力量。这是你的优势。为了你的幸福而要求它，为了人类的幸福而要求它。为了你与大社区互动的能力而要求它，因为它现在是你生命的一部分，并将变得越来越多，因为世界正在进入大社区，必须学会解释它的影响、它的力量、它的动机和它的存在。这意味着人类正在出现在一个更广阔的生命竞争舞台上，那里有许多形式的影响和许多发展机会，这些都是人们以前无法获得的。</p>
<p>Greater problems bring greater resolutions and greater achievements. You have a greater problem; now you must find a greater achievement. You cannot do this on your own, for you will need mighty companions to help you. It is possible to accomplish this, but you will have to rethink many things that you hold dear, many ideas and ideals that you cherish, and you will have to undertake a form of preparation that is quite mysterious, for it comes from the Greater Community. We emphasize truths that human beings hold to be universal and which have been emphasized in all of the great religions of this world. But you will also learn of things that have never been taught in the world, and you will have to become more effective in your discernment and in your interaction with others to a degree that was rarely called for before. Such is your burden. Such is your gift. Such is your opportunity.</p>
<p>更大的问题带来更大的决议和更大的成就。你有一个更大的问题；现在你必须找到一个更大的成就。你不能自己做这件事，因为你将需要强大的同伴来帮助你。这是有可能完成的，但你将不得不重新思考许多你所珍视的东西，许多你所珍视的想法和理想，你将不得不进行一种相当神秘的准备，因为它来自大社区。我们强调人类认为是普遍性的真理，这些真理在这个世界上所有伟大的宗教中都得到了强调。但你也将学到世界上从未被教导过的东西，你将不得不在你的辨别力和与他人的互动中变得更加有效，达到以前很少被要求的程度。这就是你的负担。这是你的礼物。这是你的机会。</p>
<p>This is not simply to create harmony within you, but to enable you to give the contribution you have brought with you from beyond the world. If your contribution is to serve humanity’s emergence into the Greater Community, then all that I am telling you is relevant and extremely important for you to accept and to learn to comprehend.</p>
<p>这不仅仅是为了在你内部创造和谐，而是为了使你能够给予你从世界之外带来的贡献。如果你的贡献是为人类进入大社区服务，那么我告诉你的所有内容都是相关的，对你接受和学习理解极为重要。</p>
<p>I offer these ideas with the confidence that Knowledge within you will stimulate your acceptance and your understanding, for Knowledge is what engenders and nourishes life everywhere. Its mystery and its certainty represent the revelation that is awaiting you, to be discovered and contributed. This holds true here and beyond the world as well in the Greater Community. Knowledge is the universal language, the universal mind, the universal recognition and the universal redemption. It is great enough to meet the demands of your life, both here and in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>我提供这些想法时，相信你体内的内识会刺激你接受和理解，因为内识是产生和滋养各地生命的东西。它的神秘性和确定性代表了正在等待你的启示，有待你去发现和贡献。这在这里和世界之外的大社区都是如此。内识是宇宙的语言，宇宙的心智，普遍的认识和普遍的救赎。它足以满足你生命的需求，无论是在这里还是在大社区。</p>
