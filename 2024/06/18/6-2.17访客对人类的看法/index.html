<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 14, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年4月14日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is always helpful to understand how others view you. In the context of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community, it is most beneficial that you have some idea of how your neighbors perceive you. This is important to give you a new understanding of how to relate to intelligent life around you and to give you a greater vantage point to view yourself from a larger and perhaps very different viewpoint. This is a rare opportunity, for though people may attempt to have a more objective viewpoint of each other, they are still far too subjective in their evaluations, and they do not have a reference point that is significantly unique or different in order to develop a truly new perspective. You see each other according to a standard set of values.</p>
<p>了解其他种族如何看待你们总是很有帮助的。在世界进入大社区的背景下，你对你们的邻居如何看待你有一些了解是最有益的。这很重要，让你对如何与周围的智慧生命发生关系有了新的理解，并给你一个更大的观测点，从一个更大的、也许是非常不同的观点来看待自己。这是一个难得的机会，因为尽管人们可能试图对彼此有一个更客观的观点，但他们的评价仍然过于主观，他们没有一个明显独特或不同的参考点，以发展一个真正的新视角。你们是按照一套标准的价值观来看待对方的。</p>
<p>Let me then give you an idea of how others who have visited your world and who are visiting it even now perceive you. Because the visitations in the world are being made by several varied groups with divergent interests, I will give you some different viewpoints, for they are certainly not all the same. These viewpoints vary according to the purpose that these groups are serving, but together they can give you an idea of the kind of relationship you already have with other intelligent life. Though you are not yet a conscious participant and cannot participate directly or intentionally, you are in relationship already simply because you are part of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然后让我给你一个概念，让你知道曾经访问过你的世界和甚至现在正在访问你的世界的其他种族如何看待你们。因为世界上的访问是由几个兴趣不同的团体进行的，所以我将给你一些不同的观点，因为他们肯定不尽相同。这些观点根据这些团体所服务的目的而不同，但它们一起可以让你了解你与其他智慧生命已经有的那种关系。尽管你还不是一个有意识的参与者，也不能直接或有意地参与，但你已经处于关系之中，只因为你们是大社区的一部分。</p>
<p>The discrepancies between the various viewpoints of your visitors serve also to give you a larger perception of yourself and to indicate something about their nature and motives as well. Indeed, in any relationship, learning how individuals or groups observe and interpret each other is essential to establish a bond and to establish a true understanding, even where a bond is not important or appropriate.</p>
<p>你们的访客的各种观点之间的差异，也有助于给你一个更大的自我感知，并表明一些关于他们的性质和动机。事实上，在任何关系中，学习个人或团体如何观察和解释对方，对于建立纽带和建立真实的理解至关重要，即使纽带并不重要或不合适。</p>
<p>You may, of course, discount what I am saying, but it would be far wiser for you to consider it seriously. Since some of my remarks will seem very critical or perhaps humbling to your evaluation of yourself, still it is important to receive them with the intention to learn and to understand rather than to criticize or defend current viewpoints or sets of preferences. Therefore, I invite you and encourage you to be as open-minded as possible.</p>
<p>当然，你可能会对我所说的话不屑一顾，但你认真考虑一下会明智得多。由于我的一些言论似乎非常关键，或者可能使你对自己的评价变得谦逊，因此，重要的是带着学习和理解的目的接受这些言论，而不是批评或捍卫当前的观点或偏好集。因此，我邀请你并鼓励你尽可能地保持开放的心态。</p>
<p>Let us, then, begin with the Forces of Dissonance—those groups that are allied with each other and are attempting to exploit the world to discover its secrets and its wealth and who are testing human beings, both directly and indirectly, to learn of their nature and predispositions for possible future alliances. I can understand their perception because their minds can be easily read, for in the mental environment, only the very adept can shield their own thoughts effectively from both mental and technological scrutiny. The Forces of Dissonance are not adept, though they are clever and cunning in the ways of espionage and observation. They seem far more advanced than you in this regard and can easily observe you and are learning ways to manipulate you very effectively. But they are not adept, in that they cannot control the mental environment and they cannot shield their own minds effectively. Therefore, those who are wise and more advanced than they are in influencing the mental environment can not only comprehend their motives, but in time can learn to affect them as well. The Forces of Dissonance are, indeed, being controlled by others who are far more powerful but who are not present in the world.</p>
<p>那么，让我们从不和谐的力量开始——那些相互结盟、试图利用世界来发现其秘密和财富的团体，他们直接或间接地测试人类，以了解人类的性质和倾向，以便将来可能结盟。我能理解他们的看法，因为他们的思想很容易被读懂，因为在心理环境中，只有非常精明的人才能有效地屏蔽自己的思想，使其免受心理和技术的审查。不和谐力量并不精于此道，尽管他们在间谍和观察方面聪明狡猾。在这方面，他们似乎比你们先进得多，可以轻易地观察到你们，并且正在学习如何非常有效地操纵你们。但他们并不精于此道，因为他们无法控制心理环境，也无法有效屏蔽自己的思想。因此，那些在影响心理环境方面比他们更聪明、更先进的种族不仅能理解他们的动机，而且还能及时学会影响他们。事实上，不和谐力量正在被其他更强大但却不存在于这个世界上的力量所控制。</p>
<p>Their perception of you is that you are very curious and very strange. They find you simple and very fundamental, but they do not comprehend your emotional nature at all, and your religious propensities and devotions are completely mysterious to them. They find you easy to manipulate but difficult to understand, which to them makes you unpredictable. That is why they are taking a long time to learn about you. Not only are they learning about you, they are learning from you, for you are setting certain examples which are having an impact upon them.</p>
<p>他们对你们的看法是，你们非常好奇，非常奇怪。他们发现你们很简单、很基本，但他们完全不理解你们的情感本质，你们的宗教倾向和奉献对他们来说完全是神秘的。他们发现你们很容易操纵，但很难理解，这对他们来说使你们难以捉摸。这就是为什么他们要花很长的时间来了解你们。他们不仅在了解你们，还在向你们学习，因为你们正在树立某些榜样，对他们产生影响。</p>
<p>They are not evil; they are simply misled. They are not guided by Knowledge, so they cannot gain access to the Greater Spiritual Power within them. They are part of a larger alliance where the mental influence upon them is strong. They are serving that power, so they are not here for their own interests, though their own interests seem to be served by their presence here, according to the directives that are given to them by those whom they serve. They do not look upon you with scorn or enmity; they do not look upon you as if you were stupid and ignorant. They are learning to exploit your weaknesses but are having great difficulty understanding your psychology. This makes you a greater challenge to them than you would be otherwise. Your technology is understandable to them, but it is your unusual nature and how you can use your growing technology that concerns them. Indeed, this is holding them at bay to a certain extent, which is beneficial for you.</p>
<p>他们并不邪恶；他们只是被误导。他们没有得到内识的指导，所以他们无法获得他们内在更大的精神力量。他们是一个更大的联盟的一部分，对他们的心理影响很强。他们在为那股力量服务，所以他们在这里不是为了自己的利益，尽管根据他们所服务的力量给他们的指示，他们在这里的存在似乎也是为了自己的利益。他们不是用蔑视或敌视的眼光看你们；他们不是把你们看成是愚蠢和无知的人。他们正在学习利用你们的弱点，但却很难理解你们的心理。这使得你们对他们来说是一个比其他方式更大的挑战。你们的技术对他们来说是可以理解的，但他们担心的是你们不寻常的性质，以及你们如何使用你们不断增长的技术。事实上，这在一定程度上牵制了他们，这对你们是有利的。</p>
<p>Your affections for one another are equally mysterious to them, for they do not have this experience with one another. Your emotional nature is confusing to them and as such is exerting an influence upon them, though at this point your influence upon them cannot offset their influence upon you. The very few amongst humanity who are advanced in Knowledge not only pose the greatest puzzle to these observers but also the greatest possibility to influence them. That is why we advocate the reclamation of Knowledge, so that you may not only offset unwarranted or inappropriate interferences in your life, but so that you may exert a positive and important influence here as well.</p>
<p>你们对彼此的感情对他们来说同样是神秘的，因为他们没有彼此之间的这种经历。你们的情感本质让他们感到困惑，因此对他们产生了影响，尽管在这一点上你们对他们的影响不能抵消他们对你们的影响。人类中极少数内识先进的人不仅对这些观察者构成了最大的困惑，也是影响他们的最大可能性。这就是为什么我们提倡重拾内识，这样你不仅可以抵消你生活中不必要的或不适当的干扰，而且可以在这里发挥积极和重要的影响。</p>
<p>These observers consider you to be very weak minded and indeed you are in comparison to them. In fact, human beings are very weak minded in contrast to all of the visitors here. What does it mean to be weak minded? It means that your minds are not concentrated or focused and are therefore easily distracted, easily disturbed, easily distressed, and so forth. You are not concentrated in contrast to your visitors.</p>
<p>这些观察者认为你们的心智非常薄弱，与他们相比，你们确实是这样。事实上，与这里的所有来访者相比，人类的心智是非常脆弱的。心智薄弱是什么意思？它意味着你们的心智不集中或不专注，因此容易分心、容易受干扰、容易苦恼，诸如此类。与你们的来访者相比，你们没有集中精力。</p>
<p>The Forces of Dissonance, then, find you remarkably easy to influence. Yet, they are having difficulty in understanding your motives and your behavior. For example, they cannot comprehend your experience of love. They can understand why you respond with anger or defensiveness when you are threatened. They can understand your sense of confusion when they are manipulating you. But your devotion to love as well as your religious fervor are completely mysterious to them. Here you are more advanced than they are, for this capacity is only latent within them. So, in this you are influencing them; you are confusing them. You are not as easy to manipulate if you are given to these greater spiritual incentives, these mysterious impulses. The fact that human beings devote their lives and all of their time and resources to their affections for one another is inexplicable to this group of visitors.</p>
<p>因此，不和谐力量发现你们非常容易受到影响。然而，他们很难理解你们的动机和你们的行为。例如，他们无法理解你们对爱的经验。他们可以理解为什么当你们受到威胁时，你们会做出愤怒或防御性的反应。他们可以理解当他们操纵你们时你们的困惑感。但你们对爱的奉献以及对宗教的狂热对他们来说完全是神秘的。在这里，你们比他们更先进，因为这种能力只潜藏在他们体内。所以，在这一点上你们在影响他们；你们在迷惑他们。如果你们被赋予这些更大的精神激励，这些神秘的冲动，你们就不那么容易被操纵了。人类把他们的生命和所有的时间和资源都用于他们对彼此的感情，这对这群访客来说是无法解释的。</p>
<p>Therefore, the ease with which you can be influenced or affected is being offset by your complex nature. Indeed, it is also being offset to a certain degree by your religious development, for here humanity has actually made some significant progress in comparison with other intelligent life in the Greater Community. For example, in some advanced societies there is no religion at all. In others, technology is the religion. That is not to say that you are the only race that has religion—of course not. But you cannot assume that all advanced races have a developed religious life or a set of religious traditions. Many societies have rites by which an individual is perfected in their intellectual ability or in their virtuous behavior. But worshipping a Greater Power or a greater force or identity in life is not an emphasis that is shared by all intelligent life, even within the vicinity of your world.</p>
<p>因此，你们可以被影响或被影响的容易程度正在被你们复杂的性质所抵消。事实上，它也在一定程度上被你们的宗教发展所抵消，因为在这里，与大社区的其他智慧生命相比，人类实际上已经取得了一些重大进展。例如，在一些先进的社会里，根本就没有宗教。在其他社会，技术就是宗教。这并不是说你们是唯一有宗教的种族——当然不是。但你不能假设所有先进的种族都有发达的宗教生活或一套宗教传统。许多社会都有仪式，通过这些仪式，个人的智力能力或美德行为得到了完善。但是，崇拜更伟大的力量或更强大的力量或生命的身份，并不是所有智慧生命所共有的重点，即使是在你们世界的附近。</p>
<p>So, there are some offsetting influences that you are exerting upon these visitors. However, do not take great comfort in this, for religious fervor can easily be manipulated once it is understood. In fact, it does not even have to be understood. Religious fervor can simply be studied and then it can be controlled. As an example of this, the Forces of Dissonance are able to project images in the mental environment. Here they can project an image of a preferred religious symbol or personality. The people being affected by this can have this experience in their dreams or in an altered state. They will then think that they are having a religious experience, and they will want to give themselves to this experience.</p>
<p>因此，你们对这些来访者施加了一些抵消性的影响。然而，不要对此感到非常安慰，因为一旦理解了宗教的狂热，就很容易被操纵。事实上，它甚至不需要被理解。宗教狂热可以简单地被研究，然后就可以被控制。作为一个例子，不和谐力量能够在心理环境中投射图像。在这里，他们可以投射出一个喜欢的宗教符号或人格的形象。受此影响的人可以在梦中或在改变的状态下获得这种经历。然后他们会认为自己有宗教经历，他们会想把自己交给这种体验。</p>
<p>Humanity does have a rich spiritual life and set of traditions, but there is not the commensurate understanding of the mental environment in order to balance this and to offset unwarranted and inappropriate influences upon it. When you think of this, you will realize that whole groups of people, even nations of people and whole cultures of people, can be influenced by the projection of religious images. An example of this would be the idea of The Second Coming of Christ. This could be well orchestrated by the Forces of Dissonance. Indeed, they could create this great drama which would divide humanity into the so-called believers and non-believers. This could cast brother against brother, family against family, nation against nation.</p>
<p>人类确实有丰富的精神生活和一系列的传统，但却没有相应的对心理环境的理解，以平衡这种环境，抵消对它的无端和不适当的影响。当你想到这一点，你就会意识到，整个群体，甚至国家的人民和整个文化的人民，都会受到宗教形象投射的影响。这方面的一个例子是基督再来的想法。这可能是由不和谐力量精心策划的。事实上，他们可以创造这场大戏，将人类分为所谓的信徒和非信徒。这可能使兄弟对兄弟，家庭对家庭，国家对国家。</p>
<p>At the present time, it is not the intention of the Forces of Dissonance to create global warfare or to establish a state of complete breakdown in human society. It is possible that they can influence this. Though it would not happen immediately, it could certainly take place. It is for this reason that there are spiritual forces as well as beneficial Greater Community presences in the world to offset the presence of the Forces of Dissonance.</p>
<p>目前，不和谐力量并不打算制造全球战争或在人类社会中建立一个完全崩溃的状态。他们有可能对此产生影响。虽然它不会立即发生，但肯定会发生的。正是由于这个原因，世界上存在着精神力量以及有益的大社区存在，以抵消不和谐力量的存在。</p>
<p>Humanity has great promise, though it has great difficulties and some important liabilities. Here you must understand that you are very vulnerable. Though you are casting an influence upon the Forces of Dissonance, their commitment to their purpose is such that it will override any fascination they may have with you and will enable them to learn ways to manipulate you, even if they cannot comprehend your behavior. For example, in your world scientists can manipulate animals in order to study their behavior by making them do things they would not do otherwise and by controlling their responses by controlling the stimulation. This does not mean that they understand the way these animals think or feel. It is not necessary to understand someone to control them. It is not necessary to empathize with them in order to learn ways of stimulating them and manipulating their response. Therefore, you are very vulnerable here.</p>
<p>人类有很大的希望，尽管它有很大的困难和一些重要的责任。在这里你必须明白，你们是非常脆弱的。虽然你们对不和谐力量施加了影响，但他们对自己的目的的承诺是如此之大，以至于会超越他们对你们的任何迷恋，并使他们能够学会操纵你们的方法，即使他们不能理解你们的行为。例如，在你们的世界里，科学家可以操纵动物，以研究它们的行为，让它们做它们不会做的事情，并通过控制刺激来控制它们的反应。这并不意味着他们理解这些动物的思维或感觉方式。没有必要为了控制某人而了解他。没有必要为了学习刺激他们和操纵他们的反应的方法而与他们产生共鸣。因此，你们在这里是非常脆弱的。</p>
<p>The perception of you by the Forces of Dissonance, generally speaking, is that you are weak minded, foolish, inexplicable and somewhat fascinating. They are also quite fascinated by your physical environment, for many of these individuals were born in space, and they have lived aboard spacecraft their entire lives. Here they are visiting this lush and marvelously diverse world with a seemingly infinite variety of life forms. This is fascinating to them. This, too, has the power to somewhat offset their mission, for they are quite taken with this place. Nonetheless, the power that is controlling them will continue to reassert itself and reaffirm the purpose that these groups are trained and prepared to serve.</p>
<p>一般来说，不和谐力量对你们的看法是，你们心智薄弱、愚蠢、无法解释，而且有些迷人。他们也对你们的物理环境相当着迷，因为这些种族中有许多生命是在太空中出生的，他们一生都生活在太空船上。在这里，他们正在参观这个郁郁葱葱、奇妙多样的世界，这里有似乎是无限的生命形式。这对他们来说是很吸引人的。这也有能力在一定程度上抵消他们的任务，因为他们对这个地方很感兴趣。尽管如此，控制他们的力量将继续重申自己，并重申这些团体被训练和准备服务的目的。</p>
<p>It is possible, however, that should enough individuals in the human family cultivate Knowledge and be able to exert a greater influence while offsetting unwarranted influences through wise discernment and self-control, then they could turn the tide in time. To give an example, imagine that you were sent out to make someone else do something and to engage with this other person whom you had to control or manipulate in some way. Then you meet that person and become fascinated with them, and this fascination begins to change your ideas and your motive. In time, if the attraction is great enough, it can overcome your initial purpose. This happens on rare occasions between human beings. It can happen as well in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然而，有可能的是，如果人类大家庭中有足够多的人培养了内识，并且能够发挥更大的影响力，同时通过明智的辨别力和自我控制来抵消不正当的影响，那么他们就能及时扭转局势。举个例子，想象一下，你被派去让别人做某事，并与这个你必须以某种方式控制或操纵的人接触。然后你遇到那个人，并为之着迷，这种着迷开始改变你的想法和动机。随着时间的推移，如果吸引力足够大，它可以克服你最初的目的。这种情况在人类之间很少发生。在大社区里也会发生这种情况。</p>
<p>Therefore, though human beings appear foolish to this group of visitors, they hold an attraction as well. These observers have never seen flowers, have never seen birds, have never seen insects, have never seen foliage such as your world possesses. What a marvel it is to them! This is important in diffusing their initial purpose, the purpose they were sent here to fulfill, which is to gain information about this world and to acquire all of its technological and mental powers—especially the mental powers that advanced human beings have been able to cultivate. Their quest is for power. Their quest is for possible domination in the future.</p>
<p>因此，尽管人类在这群访客面前显得很愚蠢，但人类也拥有一种吸引力。这些观察者从未见过花，从未见过鸟，从未见过昆虫，从未见过你们世界所拥有的树叶。对他们来说，这是一个多么了不起的奇迹啊。这对分散他们最初的目的很重要，他们被派到这里来的目的，就是获得关于这个世界的信息，并获得其所有的技术和心理力量——特别是先进人类所能培养的心理力量。他们的追求是为了权力。他们的追求是为了在未来可能的统治。</p>
<p>Now let us speak of another group that is here. I shall not mention their names because that is not important at this time. They are here to observe you because they live in your district. They are more numerous than the Forces of Dissonance because the Forces of Dissonance always travel in concealment, attempting to hide their presence and to make their investigations as secret as possible. Many of the more obvious demonstrations of extraterrestrial presence in the world have been from your neighbors who are here to observe you. Why are they observing you? Because you are an emerging world and you are gaining access to important forms of technology. It is well known to them that you are very warlike and seek conquest and dominion. This makes it very likely that you will carry out this motive once you learn to escape the boundaries of your world.</p>
<p>现在让我们来谈谈在这里的另一个群体。我将不提及他们的名字，因为这在此时并不重要。他们在这里观察你们，因为他们住在你们的地区。他们比不和谐力量更多，因为不和谐力量总是在隐蔽的情况下行动，试图隐藏他们的存在，并使他们的调查尽可能的秘密。世界上许多更明显的关于外星存在的展示都是来自你们的邻居，他们在这里观察你们。他们为什么要观察你们？因为你们是一个新兴的世界，你们正在获得重要的技术形式。他们清楚地知道，你们非常好战，寻求征服和统治。这使得你们一旦学会摆脱你们世界的边界，就很有可能实施这一动机。</p>
<p>Therefore, your neighbors are here to learn of your technology, your capabilities and your predispositions. Many of the sightings of craft have been of these individuals. They are not so concerned with being secretive, out of sight or hidden. In fact, many of their presentations have been quite intentional in order to gauge your response. They do find you fascinating and somewhat unpredictable, but their regard for you is not very high, for they consider you brutish and uncivilized. Though they have studied many individuals in the world and have been impressed by them, they recognize overall that the race of humanity is not yet united and represents many divergent views and interests. This makes you potentially very dangerous, for it is clear that you will turn upon one another for even trivial reasons. Because devotion is such an important virtue in the Greater Community, it is assumed by this group, who is studying you for their own self-protection, that you are a race that cannot be trusted and that you will wield your newfound powers and abilities in ways that are very harmful to yourselves and to other races who potentially could be your neighbors in the distant future. They have come at a time in keeping with humanity’s development of atomic power because this represents an ability to affect life beyond your world.</p>
<p>因此，你们的邻居在这里学习你们的技术、你们的能力和你们的倾向性。许多飞船的目击者都是这些外星存在。他们并不那么在意隐秘，不被人看到或隐藏。事实上，他们的许多展示都是相当有意的，以衡量你们的反应。他们确实发现你们很迷人，而且有点不可预测，但他们对你们的评价并不高，因为他们认为你们很野蛮，不文明。虽然他们研究了世界上的许多人，并对他们印象深刻，但他们总体上认识到，人类的种族还没有团结起来，代表了许多不同的观点和利益。这使你们有可能非常危险，因为很明显，你们会因为哪怕是微不足道的原因而互相攻击。由于奉献在大社区中是如此重要的美德，这群为了自我保护而研究你们的外星存在认为，你们是一个不可信任的种族，你们会以对自己和其他可能在遥远的未来成为你们邻居的世界以非常有害的方式挥舞你们新发现的力量和能力。他们的到来与人类发展原子弹的时间一致，因为这代表了影响你们世界以外世界的能力。</p>
<p>This group is not advanced in the ways of the mental environment, though like all groups that travel in the Greater Community, they are aware of this power. It is evident to them that humanity has the potential for cultivating this power, but humanity’s liabilities are so great, in this group’s estimation, that it is unlikely that humanity as a whole will mentally advance much at all. Human technology will advance, but that does not mean that people here will advance in the ways of influence.</p>
<p>这些团体在心理环境方面并不先进，尽管像所有在大社区旅行的团体一样，他们也意识到了这种力量。对他们来说，人类显然有培养这种能力的潜力，但在这个群体的估计中，人类的责任是如此之大，以至于整个人类在心理上根本不可能有什么进步。人类的技术会进步，但这并不意味着这里的人在影响力方面会进步。</p>
<p>Therefore, they are studying you, and they are also learning about the biology of the world, for their world is far more barren. This has engendered their need for advanced technology. They are taking many samples of plants and animals away from the world for their own cultivation needs. They have no intention of dominating the world, conquering it or influencing it. They are studying it, and they are learning some things about you. Your agriculture, for example, is very fascinating to them. Your domestication of animals is very fascinating to them. Though they grow food, they have no domestication of animals. As a matter of fact, this particular group does not even eat flesh, so they are somewhat shocked and fascinated by human consumption of animal flesh. The mutilation of animals has been conducted by this group, for example, because they want to understand what these animals are, why you feed upon them and how they can be developed for possible food resources for themselves.</p>
<p>因此，他们正在研究你们，他们也在学习这个世界的生物学知识，因为他们的世界要贫瘠得多。这使他们对先进的技术产生了需求。他们正在从这个世界带走许多植物和动物的样本，以满足他们自己的种植需求。他们无意主宰这个世界，征服它或影响它。他们正在研究它，并且他们正在学习关于你们的一些事情。例如，你们的农业，对他们来说非常吸引人。你们对动物的驯化对他们来说非常吸引人。虽然他们种植食物，但他们没有驯化动物。事实上，这个特殊群体甚至不吃肉，所以他们对人类食用动物肉有些震惊和着迷。例如，这个群体对动物进行了残害，因为他们想了解这些动物是什么，为什么你们要以它们为食，以及如何将它们开发为自己可能的食物资源。</p>
<p>This group is on a learning mission, but their involvement in the world has grown over recent years. They do not pose any threat to you, and in fact, their visitations here show promise for the possibility of establishing future relations. They are concerned, however, that you are raping and diminishing the world’s resources, which will eventually force you, once your technology can accommodate it, to seek resources beyond your world. This group does not inhabit your solar system, but your solar system will not meet your resource requirements, which will force you to explore beyond it once you learn how to travel at appropriate speeds. This will bring you into your neighbors’ territories.</p>
<p>这个团体的任务是学习，但他们对这个世界的参与在最近几年里越来越多。他们对你们不构成任何威胁，事实上，他们在这里的访问显示了未来建立关系的可能性。然而，他们担心你们正在掠夺和减少这个世界的资源，这将最终迫使你们，一旦你们的技术能够适应，去寻找你们世界以外的资源。这个群体并不居住在你们的太阳系，但你们的太阳系将无法满足你们的资源需求，这将迫使你们在学会如何以适当的速度旅行后，去探索太阳系以外的地方。这将使你们进入你们邻居的领土。</p>
<p>They are on a fact-finding mission here—learning a great deal about you. They are also learning a great deal about your plant and animal life, taking many samples, doing much evaluation, going back and forth, and so forth. They are learning from you. But they are also learning how to defend themselves against you. Your relationships with one another are not as inexplicable as they are to the Forces of Dissonance, but your erratic behavior, your compulsions and your fascination with trivial things are things that they do not understand. To them, you are unpredictable and somewhat chaotic, which makes the opportunity for establishing meaningful relationships, except with small groups of people here, extremely remote.</p>
<p>他们在这里执行实况调查任务——学习关于你们的大量情况。他们也在学习关于你们的植物和动物生活的大量知识，采取许多样品，做许多评估，来回奔波，等等。他们正在向你们学习。但他们也在学习如何抵御你们。你们之间的关系并不像不和谐力量那样无法解释，但你们反复无常的行为、你们的强迫症和你们对琐碎事物的迷恋都是他们不理解的事情。对他们来说，你们是不可预测的，而且有些混乱，这使得建立有意义的关系的机会极其渺茫，除了与这里的一小群人。</p>
<p>Let us now speak of a third group. I am talking about three primary groups. Though there have been visitations by others—resource explorers, for example, who are looking to see what the world contains and to see if there is a possibility for trade with the culture of humanity—I am talking about three main groups that comprise those who are visiting the world.</p>
<p>现在让我们谈一谈第三个团体。我说的是三个主要团体。虽然也有其他团体来访——例如，资源探险家，他们想看看这个世界包含什么，看看是否有可能与人类文化进行贸易，但我说的是三个主要团体，包括那些正在访问这个世界的团体。</p>
<p>The third group is here for very different purposes. They are a small contingency of individuals who are monitoring the presence of the Forces of Dissonance, for they have come to monitor this presence. They, too, are learning about humanity, but for a very different purpose. They wish for humanity to thrive and to progress. They are driven by a greater incentive. They have spiritual alliances that are serving them. They are not here for commerce; they are not here for conquest or manipulation; they are not here to learn about you for their own self-defense. They are here to cultivate humanity’s education, to support humanity without direct interference. They, too, are studying individuals, for they must learn not only your psychology, but your physiology as well. They are providing education. They are stimulating certain individuals who have the real potential to receive a Greater Community understanding. They are supporting the introduction of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. They are wise enough not to interfere with you directly, and they maintain their surveillance in such a way that their physical presence is not made manifest.</p>
<p>第三个团体是为了非常不同的目的而来。他们是一小部分外星生命，正在监视不和谐力量的存在，因为他们是来监视这种存在的。他们也在了解人类，但目的非常不同。他们希望人类能够茁壮成长和进步。他们被一个更大的动机所驱动。他们有为他们服务的精神联盟。他们在这里不是为了商业；他们在这里不是为了征服或操纵；他们在这里不是为了自己的自卫而了解你们。他们在这里是为了培养人类的教育，支持人类而不直接干涉。他们也在研究个人，因为他们不仅要学习你们的心理学，还要学习你们的生理学。他们正在提供教育。他们正在刺激某些具有真正潜力的个人，让他们接受大社区的理解。他们正在支持引入大社区内识之路。他们有足够的智慧，不会直接干涉你们，并以一种不显现其物理存在的方式进行监视。</p>
<p>Overall, this group represents the Forces of Good for humanity. In your own vernacular, they could be called “the good guys.” They are more advanced than your neighbors who are studying you. In fact, they are also studying your neighbors. They are studying everyone here to learn about the condition of humanity and to learn how you are going to respond to the Greater Community. They are in contact with several individuals around the world, attempting to cultivate a greater spiritual knowledge and understanding. They are establishing relationships with these individuals in the mental environment. This does not mean that these people are aware that they are in relationship or that they necessarily accept the relationship. It just means that the relationship is already there and that should these individuals accept it and learn to participate in a conscious and responsible manner, they will be the beneficiaries of a greater Wisdom.</p>
<p>总的来说，这个团体代表了人类的善的力量。用你们自己的话说，他们可以被称为”好人”。他们比你们的邻居们更先进，他们正在研究你们。事实上，他们也在研究你们的邻居。他们正在研究这里的每个人，以了解人类的状况，并了解你们将如何回应大社区。他们正在与大社区世界各地的几个团体接触，试图培养更多的精神知识和理解。他们正在心理环境中与这些人建立关系。这并不意味着这些人意识到他们在发生关系，也不意味着他们一定接受这种关系。它只是意味着这种关系已经存在，如果这些人接受它并学会以有意识和负责任的方式参与，他们将成为更大智慧的受益者。</p>
<p>This third group is very concerned that the Forces of Dissonance not discover the secrets of this world. We are not speaking of the secrets of humanity here because humanity does not have many secrets. We are speaking of the secrets of the world—what has been put into this world, what has been kept in this world for a long, long time, far longer than human civilization. They are here to protect these things. They do not want humans to discover them either, for humanity is not ready to wield great power, and they do not want them to be discovered by any other alien force.</p>
<p>第三个团体非常担心不和谐力量发现这个世界的秘密。我们在这里说的不是人类的秘密，因为人类并没有什么秘密。我们说的是这个世界的秘密——那些被放入这个世界的东西，那些被保存在这个世界上很久很久的东西，远远超过人类文明的时间。他们在这里是为了保护这些东西。他们也不希望人类发现这些东西，因为人类还没有准备好挥舞强大的力量，他们也不希望这些东西被任何其他外星势力所发现。</p>
<p>Their presence, then, overall, is to protect humanity and to protect the secrets of the world. Perhaps this seems incomprehensible to you. This is only because you hold a viewpoint that is so limited it does not account for other intelligent life. There is a general assumption amongst people that their world is the center of the universe, that it is a place that is isolated from everything else because of vast distances, and that it has come into being with human society. But the world has been here far longer than human civilization, far longer than human beings have been here. Much has transpired in your world. This world has been considered a valuable place to visit, to conduct experiments and to develop the depositories where secret things could be kept hidden from the Greater Community.</p>
<p>那么，总体而言，他们的存在是为了保护人类，保护世界的秘密。也许这对你来说似乎是不可理解的。这只是因为你持有的观点非常有限，没有考虑到其他智慧生命。人们普遍认为自己的世界是宇宙的中心，这个世界是一个因距离遥远而与其他世界隔绝的地方，并且它是随着人类社会的出现而出现的。但是这个世界在这里的时间远远超过人类文明，远远超过人类在这里的时间。在你们的世界里发生了很多事情。这个世界一直被认为是一个有价值的地方，可以访问，可以进行实验，也可以开发储存库，把秘密的东西藏起来，不让大社区知道。</p>
<p>Now, there is another influence here—a spiritual influence, a spiritual group, if you will. They hold you to be very, very promising though still quite adolescent in your development. Their commitment is for you to learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, to enable your sense of spirituality and your spiritual traditions to evolve into a larger arena of life and be applicable there, in order to give you a more universal sense of the Greater Power in life and to engender the cultivation of intelligence, responsibility and cooperation. These are the three fundamental pillars upon which any race or society must develop and advance. This group is not here to protect you; they are here to educate you and to lift you up. They are working in an alliance with the Forces of Good that I have just described. Their viewpoint of you is very commensurate with the Forces of Good, though their comprehension of you is greater. The Forces of Good consider you to be fascinating, childlike, irresponsible, mentally weak, foolish, predisposed to do things for ridiculous reasons, yet nonetheless worthy of their assistance and support. They are particularly impressed by your ability to love and to be devoted, to whatever extent this has been developed.</p>
<p>现在，这里有另一种影响——一种精神影响，一个精神团体，如果你愿意的话。他们认为你们是非常、非常有前途的，尽管在你们的发展中仍是相当的青少年。他们的承诺是让你们学习大社区内识之路，使你们的精神意识和精神传统能够发展到更大的生命领域，并适用于那里，以使你们对生命中的更大力量有更普遍的认识，并培养智慧、责任和合作。这是任何种族或社会必须发展和进步的三个基本支柱。这个团体在这里不是为了保护你们；他们在这里是为了教育你们，提升你们。他们与我刚才描述的善的力量结成联盟，共同工作。他们对你们的看法与善的力量非常相称，尽管他们对你们的理解力更强。善的力量认为你们是迷人的、像孩子一样的、不负责任的、心理上脆弱的、愚蠢的、有倾向性地为了可笑的原因而做事，但仍然值得他们帮助和支持。他们对你们的爱和奉献的能力印象特别深刻，无论这种能力发展到什么程度。</p>
<p>You are a race that has developed in isolation. You are unique in this respect in that you have not been tampered with by the Greater Community until very recently. The Forces of Good are particularly impressed by many of your religions, particularly those that emphasize the development of virtue in the individual, for these are values that they hold dear as well. They are a highly cultured group of individuals, representing several races that are working in cooperation for a particular mission here.</p>
<p>你们是一个在孤立中发展的种族。在这方面，你们是独一无二的，因为直到最近你们才被大社区篡改过。善的力量对你们的许多宗教印象特别深刻，尤其是那些强调个人美德发展的宗教，因为这些也是他们所珍视的价值。他们是一群有高度文化的种族，代表着几个种族，在这里为一个特定的使命而合作。</p>
<p>Spiritual forces are present, but you will not be aware of them until you undertake the preparation that they have provided and are supporting. They will enhance true development, the commitment to serve others and the cultivation of virtue and intelligence, which is the willingness and the capacity to learn. Unless you are undertaking the preparation for the great threshold of emerging into a Greater Community identity and awareness, you will be unlikely to experience their presence. They work in conjunction with other spiritual forces that have been in the world all along, cultivating and nurturing human advancement.</p>
<p>精神力量是存在的，但你不会意识到它们，直到你进行他们已经提供并正在支持的准备。它们将加强真正的发展、服务他人的承诺和德行与智慧的培养，也就是学习的意愿和能力。除非你正在为进入大社区身份和意识的伟大门槛进行准备，否则你将不太可能经历到它们的存在。他们与一直存在于世界上的其他精神力量一起工作，培养和滋养人类的进步。</p>
<p>Given my very simple descriptions of your visitors, which I might say are rudimentary and leave out many important aspects and complexities, you will begin to see that you have a great responsibility here to cultivate Knowledge and Wisdom, which will allow for the wise expression and application of Knowledge. You must cultivate the ability to learn to cooperate with others, which you will be able to do more effectively once you gain a Greater Community perspective. Here you will see that the differences between people are slight instead of great and that cooperation is not only possible but necessary in light of your growing relationships and involvement with the Greater Community itself. Here you will realize that there is a tremendous emphasis on the human family becoming mature, developing a greater viewpoint about themselves and life and learning over time to accept their relationship with other intelligent life and the very fact that they are living in a Greater Community of Worlds.</p>
<p>鉴于我对你们来访者的非常简单的描述，我可以说是初级的，遗漏了许多重要的方面和复杂性，你将开始看到，你在这里有很大的责任来培养内识和智慧，这将使内识得到明智的表达和应用。你必须培养学习与他人合作的能力，一旦你获得了大社区的视角，你就能更有效地做到这一点。在这里，你将看到人与人之间的差异是微小的，而不是巨大的，鉴于你与大社区本身的关系和参与度不断提高，合作不仅是可能的，而且是必要的。在这里你会意识到，有一个巨大的重点是人类大家庭变得成熟，对自己和生命发展出更大的观点，并随着时间的推移学会接受他们与其他智慧生命的关系，以及他们生活在一个世界大社区中的事实。</p>
<p>Human advancement will be greatly furthered by individuals becoming educated in The Way of Knowledge according to the Greater Community traditions, for now you need to learn the Greater Community traditions in order to surpass what human beings have attempted to accomplish on their own. You need education from beyond; you need a mentor from beyond; you need forms of preparation from beyond, for in isolation you cannot prepare yourself. You must be prepared. This will offset the destructive and conflicting incentives on your part. It will enable you to support the emergence of a greater understanding and will allow you to utilize your mental and physical resources far more harmoniously and effectively. All of these are necessary for the evolution and advancement of humanity.</p>
<p>人类的进步将因个人根据大社区传统接受内识之路的教育而得到极大的推动，因为现在你需要学习大社区的传统，以超越人类自己试图完成的事情。你需要来自外部的教育；你需要来自外部的导师；你需要来自外部的准备形式，因为在孤立的情况下你无法准备好自己。你必须做好准备。这将抵消你身上的破坏性和冲突性的激励。它将使你能够支持一个更大的理解的出现，并将使你能够更和谐和有效地使用你的心理和身体资源。所有这些对于人类的进化和进步都是必要的。</p>
<p>Here you must see that you are not yet mature, that you are not yet adults in the real sense. You are adolescent in that you are experiencing new power and newfound freedoms and abilities, but you do not yet have the maturity, the sense of responsibility or the interdependence in relationships necessary in order to use these powers constructively. Human beings, for example, must learn to live for the welfare of their human family, not simply their blood family, but for their society and world. They must learn to do this in such a way that their individuality is enhanced through contribution and is not denied. Human society has not established this ability yet, though it has been proposed by many visionaries and wise individuals throughout the ages. Humanity has not developed sufficiently to enable this to find a firm and complete expression. Many people even consider it impossible, given their understanding of human nature. But human nature is not something that has been completely explored or developed, and human beings have not been prepared by a greater and more intelligent power.</p>
<p>这里你必须明白，你们还不够成熟，还没有达到真正意义上的成年。你们处于青春期，正在体验新的力量、新发现的自由和能力，但你们还没有具备必要的成熟度、责任感或关系中的相互依赖性来建设性地使用这些力量。例如，人类必须学会为人类家庭的福祉而生活，不仅是为了自己的血缘家族，而是为了整个社会和世界。人类必须学会以这样的方式生活，使人类的个体性通过贡献得到增强而不是被否定。人类社会尚未建立这种能力，尽管许多预言家和智慧人士在各个时代都提出过这种观点。人类还没有发展到足以使这种观点得到坚实和完整表达的程度。很多人甚至认为这是不可能的，基于他们对人性本质的理解。但人性并不是一个已经完全被探索或发展的东西，人类也没有为更大和更高智慧的力量做好准备。</p>
<p>Consider this fact: It is far more time consuming and far less effective to learn something on your own than it is to prepare with someone who is more advanced in that skill than you are. Human beings have been trying to prepare themselves on their own, yet what has allowed the greatest advancement is that information has been given to certain gifted individuals who were capable of actually producing a tangible result or carrying out a tangible demonstration in the world. Your technological advancement has been sparked and furthered through this contribution; your spiritual comprehension has been sparked and furthered through this contribution. It is outside influences that keep nurturing your advancement, and though these influences are rarely accounted for, rarely acknowledged and sometimes cruelly considered, they nonetheless have been responsible for your advancement and your increasing freedom and ability, both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>考虑这个事实：自己学习某事比与在某项技能上比你更高级的人一起准备要耗费更多时间，而且效果也差得多。人类一直在试图靠自己准备，然而最大的进步来自于信息被赋予某些有才华的个体，他们能够实际产生具体成果或在世界上进行具体演示。你们的技术进步得以激发和推动正是通过这种贡献；你们的精神理解力也是通过这种贡献激发和推进的。是外界的影响不断培育你们的进步，虽然这些影响很少被说明，很少被承认，有时甚至被残酷地否定，但它们确实是你们进步和不断增强的自由和能力（无论是心理上还是身体上）的原因所在。</p>
<p>Therefore, humanity overall requires tremendous preparation. The world now is supporting this by calling upon people everywhere to join and to unite to fulfill common needs and common purposes—to salvage your environment, to equalize the distribution of your wealth, to learn the wise use of your resources, to cease incessant conflict and warfare and to learn to see beyond tribal and regional identities in order to develop an identity as world citizens. All this is happening at a remarkably quick pace, so fast in fact that most people cannot keep up with it. This is all part of your emergence into the Greater Community. It is all part of living in an accelerated evolutionary period. This is a very difficult period and will incite and bring forth much of the inbred human resentment and conflict that already exist here. This acceleration can lead to new achievements and understanding or it can lead to tremendous breakdown and destruction for humanity.</p>
<p>因此，人类总体上需要巨大的准备。现在的世界正在支持这一点，呼吁各地的人们加入并团结起来，以满足共同的需求和共同的目的——拯救你们的环境，平等分配你们的财富，学习明智地使用你们的资源，停止不断的冲突和战争，学习超越部落和地区的身份，以发展作为世界公民的身份。所有这些都在以惊人的速度发生，事实上快到大多数人都无法跟上。这都是你们进入大社区的一部分。这都是生活在一个加速的进化时期的一部分。这是一个非常困难的时期，将煽动和带来许多已经存在于这里的人类固有的怨恨和冲突。这种加速可以导致新的成就和理解，也可以导致人类巨大的崩溃和毁灭。</p>
<p>Present in this acceleration are the Forces of Good and the Forces of Dissonance. Present here is a great opportunity for a quantum leap in spiritual development and understanding and a quantum leap in humanity’s cultural integration and establishment. These are necessary because in order for humanity to begin to effectively engage with the Greater Community in a conscious way and to establish relationships, it must be a unified community. It cannot be a set of divided and conflicting societies. In the future, this will require some form of world government—one that perhaps will allow for tremendous regional diversity. But there must be a world government. This is slowly developing. In fact, it is developing very quickly when you consider how slowly these things normally develop. You are in an evolutionary fast-forward right now. The Greater Community presences here are stimulating this. The growth of the human family and its changing interaction with one another and with the natural environment here are also contributing to this tremendous acceleration in development.</p>
<p>在这个加速过程中，存在着善的力量与不和谐的力量。这里存在着精神发展和理解的巨大机会，以及人类文化整合和建立的巨大飞跃。这些都是必要的，因为为了使人类开始以有意识的方式有效地与大社区接触并建立关系，它必须是一个统一的社区。它不能是一套分裂和冲突的社会。在未来，这将需要某种形式的世界政府——也许将允许极大的区域多样性。但必须有一个世界政府。这正在慢慢发展。事实上，当你考虑到这些事情通常发展得很慢时，它正在迅速发展。你们现在正处于进化的快进阶段。这里的大社区存在正在刺激这个。人类大家庭的成长及其与彼此之间以及与自然环境之间不断改变的互动，也有助于这种巨大的加速发展。</p>
<p>Humanity is in an adolescent period in its development. You have newfound powers and abilities; you have greater freedoms; you are learning new things; you are entertaining greater insights; you are becoming more aware of the environment around you. But adolescents are still self-seeking and self-serving and are still committed to their own personal priorities. You have not yet significantly developed a social consciousness. You are not aware of other races’ experience significantly, especially in the Greater Community. Adolescents cannot yet account for the forces that are shaping their lives, though they are beginning to be sensitive to them.</p>
<p>人类正处于发展中的青春期。你们有新发现的力量和能力；你们有更大的自由；你们正在学习新的东西；你们正在获得更大的洞察力；你们对自己周围的环境变得更加了解。但青少年仍然是自我追求和自我服务的，仍然致力于自己的个人优先事项。你们还没有明显发展出社会意识。你们没有明显意识到其他种族的经历，特别是在大社区。青少年还不能说明塑造他们生命的力量，尽管他们已经开始对这些力量敏感。</p>
<p>In this difficult period, you are developing a Greater Community awareness at the very, very beginning stages. You are not necessarily adolescent with each other, but you are adolescent within the context of the Greater Community and in your ability to be in relationship to the Greater Community—to accept its presence and its reality, to discern its influences and to learn to participate with the degree of Wisdom that will be necessary for you to have in order to survive as an independent race in the future.</p>
<p>在这个困难时期，你们在非常、非常初始的阶段发展大社区意识。你们彼此之间不一定是青少年，但你们在大社区的背景下是青少年，在你们与大社区的关系中是青少年——接受它的存在和它的现实，辨别它的影响，并学习以一定程度的智慧参与，这对你们在未来作为一个独立种族生存是必要的。</p>
<p>Here, then, is your great calling and your great requirement. The call and the need for advancement is tremendous. Even if you do not accept your life in the Greater Community or if you discount the Greater Community influences that are present in the world today, you must still realize that human society needs to grow, to become integrated and to become wiser and more cooperative even in order to meet your environmental and economic needs.</p>
<p>那么，这里就是你的伟大召唤和伟大要求。对进步的召唤和需求是巨大的。即使你不接受你在大社区中的生命，或者不考虑今天世界上存在的大社区影响，你仍然必须认识到，人类社会需要成长，需要整合，甚至为了满足你们的环境和经济需要而变得更加明智和更加合作。</p>
<p>Everything that I am presenting here is absolutely essential for your success and well-being, even if you remained an isolated race. Yet, I paint a greater picture and illustrate the larger range of your relationships and the influences that are being cast upon the world at this time from beyond the world. How much greater this is! This is your life. If you learn to respond to your life, you will be able to participate in a way that is both effective and satisfying. If you cannot respond, then you will feel infringed upon by the changes and influences that are shaping you, both from within your world and from beyond. And you will find no relief from the miseries that attend you until this responsibility is recognized and is accepted. This is true within your own individual life. This is true within your life as a community, within your life as a nation, and within your life as a world in the Greater Community. As it is above, so it is below, for the truth exists everywhere. The denial of truth and the acceptance of truth is a process that is going on wherever intelligent life has emerged.</p>
<p>我在这里介绍的一切对你们的成功和福祉绝对是必不可少的，即使你们仍然是一个孤立的种族。然而，我描绘了一幅更大的画面，说明了你们的关系的更大范围，以及此时从世界之外投向世界的影响。这是多大的事啊!这就是你的生命。如果你学会对你的生命做出回应，你将能够以一种既有效又令人满意的方式参与。如果你不能回应，那么你会感到被那些从你们的世界内外塑造你们的变化和塑造你们的影响所侵犯。在这种责任被认识和接受之前，你将无法摆脱随之而来的苦难。在你们的个人生活中是如此。在你们作为一个社区的生活中是如此，在你们作为国家的生活中也是如此，在你们作为一个大社区的世界中也是如此。上如是，下亦如是，因为真理无处不在。对真理的否定和对真理的接受是一个过程，无论在哪里出现了智慧生命，这个过程都在进行着。</p>
<p>Learning how others view you gives you a reference point and an idea of how you must cultivate your abilities and what you must achieve. You start with your individual life by bringing greater harmony, balance, responsibility and accountability to it. You do this because you recognize a deeper need within you, and you are willing to take the risks and make the sacrifices. Here you gain access to Knowledge, the Greater Mind within you, the Mind that knows, the Mind that can guide and direct you and give you the strength and the confidence to undertake the transformation of your life. As you do this, you will be able to contribute things of greater value, greater magnitude and greater influence in the world around you. This will draw to you individuals who will help you in your own development and in your capacity to serve and to assist others.</p>
<p>学习其他种族如何看待你们，给你一个参考点，了解你必须如何培养自己的能力，以及你必须实现什么。你从自己的个人生活开始，给它带来更大的和谐、平衡、责任和问责。你这样做是因为你认识到你内心深处的需求，而且你愿意承担风险和做出牺牲。在这里，你获得了内识，你内心的更伟大心智，知道的心智，能够指导和引导你的心智，给你力量和信心来进行你生命的转变。当你这样做时，你将能够在你周围的世界中贡献出更大的价值、更大的规模和更大的影响。这将吸引一些人来到你身边，他们将在你自己的发展以及你服务和协助他人的能力方面帮助你。</p>
