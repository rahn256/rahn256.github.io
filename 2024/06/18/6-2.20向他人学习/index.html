<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 16, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年4月16日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To advance in The Way of Knowledge, to learn of the world and to find your contribution, you must be able to learn from others. So, let us now explore this together. Positioning yourself as a student offers you a great advantage and can in many ways protect you from your own destructive tendencies. Claiming and reinforcing your studenthood gives you the opportunity to learn in a very maximal way and tends to prevent you from making premature conclusions or identifying with self-comforting ideas. It allows you to be open, vulnerable, perceptive, observant and can in many ways restrain you from coming to conclusions that do not represent a deeper understanding. By the very nature of studenthood, one must wait to learn. Yet, during this time of waiting, one must apply oneself. One must seek a curriculum of preparation, and one must become very observant of others.</p>
<p>要想在内识之路上取得进展，了解世界并找到自己的贡献，你必须能够向他人学习。所以，现在让我们一起探讨这个问题。将自己定位为学生，为你提供了巨大的优势，并能在许多方面保护你免受自身破坏性倾向的影响。声称并加强你的学生身份，使你有机会以一种非常大的方式学习，并倾向于防止你过早地做出结论或认同自我安慰的想法。它允许你开放、脆弱、敏锐、善于观察，并在许多方面限制你得出并不代表更深层理解的结论。根据学生身份的性质，人们必须等待学习。然而，在这段等待的时间里，人们必须运用自己的能力。一个人必须寻求准备的课程，一个人必须变得非常善于观察他人。</p>
<p>This seems so obvious in order to learn anything of great importance. Surely, if you think of any skill that you value, you realize that you will need instruction; you will need some kind of curriculum; you will need help from others. And you will need many examples. This is universally true and has so many applications. Yet, people do not consider this when they view their progress in life. They stumble along, learning things unwittingly and often unwillingly, trying to hold onto old ideas, trying to protect themselves and trying to buffer themselves against change, new interactions and opportunities, and so forth.</p>
<p>为了学习任何重要的东西，这似乎是很明显的。当然，如果你想到你重视的任何技能，你会意识到你将需要指导；你将需要某种课程；你将需要别人的帮助。而且你将需要许多例子。这是放之四海而皆准的，而且有很多应用。然而，人们在看待他们的生命进展时并没有考虑到这一点。他们一路跌跌撞撞，不知不觉地学习东西，往往不愿意，试图坚持旧的想法，试图保护自己，试图缓冲自己的改变，新的互动和机会，等等。</p>
<p>If you take this active student approach to life, you are able then to proceed in a way that is very conscientious, and you are able to engender the necessary responsibility for your learning. If you are honest in this approach, you will realize that you will make mistakes and that some mistakes are necessary. You will realize that many things will have to be accomplished through trial and error, that you will have to expose yourself to the different viewpoints of other people and that you will have to try things out and test them. This is a very different approach from trying to prove yourself or validate your ideas or defend your position, which is a very common approach and does not engender real learning. A real student approaches disappointment and confusion in a very different way, seeing it all as a necessary part of learning and preparation.</p>
<p>如果你采取这种积极学生的生活方式，你就能够以一种非常认真的方式进行，你就能够对你的学习产生必要的责任。如果你在这种方法中是诚实的，你会意识到你会犯错，有些错误是必要的。你会意识到，许多事情必须通过试验和错误来完成，你将不得不让自己接触其他人的不同观点，你将不得不尝试事情并对其进行测试。这与试图证明自己或验证自己的想法或捍卫自己的立场的做法截然不同，后者是一种非常普遍的做法，不会产生真正的学习。一名真正的学生以非常不同的方式对待失望和困惑，把这一切看作是学习和准备的必要部分。</p>
<p>To be part of the world and to discover your place and your purpose in it requires that you take a position as an active and intentional student. Here, if you can take the position that you do not know anything and that you want to learn as much as possible, this gives you the great advantage. This allows you to move with life in the direction in which life is going and to learn of the things that I have spoken of in these discourses. You need not take my word for it. I invite you and encourage you to explore these things for yourself, for though I am very correct in what I am saying, that will not help you unless you can find this realization for yourself.</p>
<p>要成为世界的一部分，发现你在其中的位置和目的，需要你采取积极和有意的学生的立场。在这里，如果你能采取这样的立场：你什么都不知道，你想尽可能多地学习，这就给你带来了巨大的优势。这使你能够随着生命的方向前进，学习我在这些论述中谈到的事情。你不需要相信我的话。我邀请你并鼓励你自己探索这些事情，因为尽管我说的非常正确，但除非你能自己找到这种领悟，否则这对你没有帮助。</p>
<p>Become a student. Become a student of Knowledge because the discovery of Knowledge, the emergence of Knowledge and the guidance of Knowledge is what you will need to negotiate a rapidly-changing world. In fact, you will need to realize and experience Knowledge to become a complete human being, to find a Greater Power in your life, to develop a relationship with this Greater Power and to realign yourself with people in such a way that meaningful relationships can arise and find their full expression.</p>
<p>成为一名学生。成为内识的学生，因为内识的发现、内识的出现和内识的指导是你在一个迅速改变的世界中谈判所需要的。事实上，你将需要实现和经历内识，以成为一个完整的人，在你的生命中找到一个更大的力量，与这个更大的力量发展关系，并以这样一种方式重新调整自己与人的关系，使有意义的关系能够出现并找到它们的充分表达。</p>
<p>Therefore, given the normal requirements of life and the greater opportunities that the world is presenting you now, Knowledge is your foundation because it is the greater mind within you. It is your resource for truth. It is your resource for meaning and direction. You will stumble blindly without it. You will live by ridiculous assumptions without it. You will seek comfort and avoid pain without it. The results of this latter approach have generated the confusion, the ambivalence, the uncertainty, the misery and the self-denial that you see all about you. All advancements in life that are meaningful and genuine have been prompted by Knowledge and, in most cases, individuals did not even know that Knowledge was their guide and the source of their inspiration, their strength, their courage and their motivation. But those few individuals who did realize this and aligned themselves with Knowledge consciously were able to give so much more, for they positioned themselves in life in such a way that life could become the recipient and the motivation for a great contribution to be given in the world.</p>
<p>因此，考虑到生命的正常要求和世界现在呈现给你的更大的机会，内识是你的基础，因为它是你内心更大的心智。它是你获得真理的资源。它是你获得意义和方向的资源。没有它，你会盲目地跌倒。没有它，你将靠荒谬的假设生活。没有它，你将寻求安慰，避免痛苦。这后一种方法的结果产生了混乱、矛盾、不确定、痛苦和自我否定，你看到你周围的一切。生命中所有有意义的、真正的进步都是由内识推动的，在大多数情况下，个人甚至不知道内识是他们的向导，是他们的灵感、力量、勇气和动力的来源。但那些意识到这一点并有意识地与内识保持一致的少数人能够给予更多的东西，因为他们在生命中的定位是这样的：生命可以成为世界上巨大贡献的接受者和动力。</p>
<p>A necessary part, and a very big part, of being a genuine student is learning from others. This involves many things. First of all, you will need those more advanced than you to serve in your preparation and even at some points along the way, particularly as you become more advanced, to provide direct instruction. Here you must accept yourself as a student and accept all that you do not know. If you try to teach yourself, in most things and especially in learning The Way of Knowledge, your progress will be slow, frustrating and inefficient. You will not progress. You do not have time to wander blindly about, trying this and trying that, taking a little bit of this and a little bit of that, following an eclectic approach. That is like picking up scraps from beneath the table when in fact a great feast is being presented to you. Why pick up scraps when you can sit at the table and receive the gifts of Knowledge? Do not be a beggar. Be a recipient. Be a student.</p>
<p>作为一名真正的学生，一个必要的部分，也是一个非常大的部分，就是向他人学习。这涉及许多事情。首先，你需要那些比你更先进的人为你做准备，甚至在某些时候，特别是当你变得更先进时，提供直接指导。在这里，你必须接受自己是个学生，接受你所不知道的一切。如果你试图自己教自己，在大多数事情上，特别是在学习内识之路方面，你的进步将是缓慢、令人沮丧和低效的。你将不会有任何进步。你没有时间盲目地徘徊，尝试这个，尝试那个，学一点这个，学一点那个，采取折中的方法。这就像从桌子下面捡拾残渣，而事实上，一场大餐正呈现在你面前。当你可以坐在桌前接受内识的礼物时，为什么要捡拾残羹剩饭？不要做一个乞丐。要做一个接受者。做一名学生。</p>
<p>You will need instruction. You will need to accept that other people are more advanced than you are and, without glorifying them, deifying them or making them your sole focus, you can learn to receive from them and to support them. Learning from a teacher involves several things. It involves receiving, evaluation and application. It also involves supporting that individual, which is your form of giving to them. Particularly in The Way of Knowledge, real teachers of Knowledge rely upon this, for they are giving their life to this service and they are worthy of generous support. Do not bargain with your support, but give what you know you have to give. Then there will be no inequality and no uncertainty in the relationship.</p>
<p>你将需要指导。你将需要接受其他人比你更先进的事实，在不美化他们、神化他们或使他们成为你唯一的焦点的情况下，你可以学习从他们那里接受并支持他们。向老师学习涉及几件事。它包括接受、评估和应用。它还涉及到支持那个人，这是你对他们的一种给予。特别是在内识之路中，真正的内识老师依赖于此，因为他们为这项服务给予了生命，他们值得慷慨的支持。不要对你的支持讨价还价，而是给你知道你必须给予的东西。那么在这种关系中就不会有不平等和不确定性。</p>
<p>In order to learn, you must associate with those more advanced and with those less advanced than you. Certainly, this is a given fact in the world. Yet, many people are trying to have equal recognition, equal skills and equal opportunities, when in fact, they are in very different stages of development. When you have a specific focus in learning, this becomes very apparent. If you do not have a specific focus in learning, it is hard to tell. In this situation, people make ridiculous proclamations about their skills, their awareness and their abilities. And other people who are more skilled often deny their own abilities. So, it becomes very confusing, and there is a tremendous amount of self-deception. But when you are attempting something specific, such as becoming an athlete or a musician or a scientist or an engineer or a physician, you don’t simply wander about trying to pick up pieces of information. You commit yourself to a training and preparation. Because you have a specific focus here, you realize that you need this preparation. You realize that you do not have the skill, the experience or the understanding necessary to carry out this form of service or contribution.</p>
<p>为了学习，你必须与那些更先进的人和比你落后的人交往。当然，这是世界上的一个既定事实。然而，许多人都在试图拥有平等的认可、平等的技能和平等的机会，而事实上，他们处于非常不同的发展阶段。当你在学习上有一个特定的重点时，这就变得非常明显。如果你没有特定的学习重点，就很难分辨。在这种情况下，人们会对自己的技能、意识和能力做出荒谬的宣称。而其他技能更强的人往往否认自己的能力。所以，这就变得非常混乱，存在着大量的自欺欺人。但是，当你试图做一些特定的事情时，例如成为一名运动员、音乐家、科学家、工程师或医生，你不会简单地四处游荡，试图收集一些信息。你把自己投入到训练和准备中。因为你在这里有一个特定的重点，你意识到你需要这种准备。你意识到你不具备进行这种形式的服务或贡献所需的技能、经验或理解。</p>
<p>Therefore, accept that you are a student. Accept that you need instruction and accept that you must learn from others. You can accept all of these things because they are obvious. This holds true in learning The Way of Knowledge. Learning The Way of Knowledge is more difficult than becoming a physician or an engineer or an athlete. Why? Because it is more personally challenging. It requires more change and re-evaluation. Rather than simply adding something on to yourself, learning The Way of Knowledge will change your whole viewpoint of life. This requires greater courage. I do not demean these other pursuits, for they can indeed be very special. But The Way of Knowledge is greater and requires even a more focused studenthood with more openness and fewer assumptions.</p>
<p>因此，接受你是一名学生。接受你需要指导，接受你必须向他人学习。你可以接受所有这些事情，因为它们是显而易见的。这在学习内识之路时也是如此。学习内识之路比成为一名医生、工程师或运动员更难。为什么？因为它更具有个人挑战性。它需要更多的改变和重新评估。学习内识之路不是简单地在自己身上添加一些东西，而是要改变你的整个人生观。这需要更大的勇气。我并没有贬低这些其他的追求，因为它们的确可以很特别。但是内识之路更伟大，甚至需要更专注的学习，更开放，更少假设。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge is more difficult because you are not sure what the result will look like. If you go to medical school, you know that if you can pass the examinations, you will come out as a physician. You know that if you undertake preparation to become a musician, if you persist and pass your tests, you will at least be competent at your skill. Following The Way of Knowledge, however, you are not sure what you will look like. Obviously, you will not have a career and be a professional person of Knowledge. Therefore, it is more difficult here because you must proceed with greater uncertainty. Rather than being motivated by wealth, fame, recognition or achievement, you must be motivated by something deeper within you that says that you must do this. And you go forth not knowing what it means, what it will require or what advantages you will have.</p>
<p>内识之路更难，因为你不确定结果会是什么样子。如果你去读医学院，你知道如果你能通过考试，你就会成为一名医生。你知道，如果你为成为一名音乐家做准备，如果你坚持下去并通过考试，你至少会胜任你的技能。然而，遵循内识之路，你不确定自己会是什么样子。很明显，你不会有职业，也不会成为一个专业的知识分子。因此，这里更加困难，因为你必须在更大的不确定性中前进。与其被财富、名声、认可或成就所激励，你必须被你内心深处的内识所激励，说你必须这样做。而你去的时候，不知道这意味着什么，需要什么，或者你会有什么好处。</p>
<p>Being a student of Knowledge is a very focused form of studenthood. You will need instruction. You cannot learn The Way of Knowledge yourself. You cannot learn it from going to seminars or reading books or carrying on an eclectic approach. This keeps you on the outside where you cannot enter the inner courtyard. This keeps you as an observer. You can collect all kinds of examples of other people’s preparation and other people’s achievements. You can even become a scholar studying how others in various religious traditions have attained a greater understanding. But unless you can travel the way yourself, you are simply a fan up in the grandstand waving a flag—interested but not willing to take the journey yourself.</p>
<p>作为内识的学生是一种非常集中的学习形式。你将需要指导。你不能自己学习内识之路。你不能通过参加研讨会、阅读书籍或采取折衷办法来学习它。这使你处于外部，无法进入内院。这使你成为一个观察者。你可以收集别人的准备和别人的成就的各种例子。你甚至可以成为一个学者，研究各种宗教传统中的其他人是如何获得更大的理解。但是，除非你自己能走这条路，否则你只是一个在看台上摇旗呐喊的粉丝——有兴趣但不愿意自己走这条路。</p>
<p>Being a student of Knowledge is being a student of the Mystery, but this does not mean that all of the preparation is mysterious. Much of it is very tangible. Here you must become a person who is consistent, balanced, functional, responsible and very capable. This all requires a very practical form of development. You cannot be a dreamer and enter into The Way of Knowledge because, in fact, many of your dreams will prove to be ineffective and even unwanted as you proceed. What, then, will you have to turn to as your greater resource and motivation? You can’t follow The Way of Knowledge wanting to escape the vicissitudes of life. The Way of Knowledge will turn you to face them, to meet them and to understand them. You can’t follow The Way of Knowledge to fulfill your ideals because most of them will prove to be the real obstacles that are holding you back.</p>
<p>成为内识的学生就是成为神秘的学生，但这并不意味着所有的准备都是神秘的。它的大部分是非常具体的。在这里，你必须成为一个始终如一、平衡、实用、负责和非常有能力的人。这都需要一个非常实际的发展形式。你不能成为一个梦想家而进入内识之路，因为事实上，你的许多梦想将被证明是无效的，甚至在你前进的过程中是不需要的。那么，你将不得不求助于什么，作为你更大的资源和动力？你不能为了逃避生命的沧桑而遵循内识之路。内识之路会让你面对它们，迎接它们，理解它们。你不能为了实现你的理想而追随内识之路，因为大部分的理想会被证明是阻碍你前进的真正障碍。</p>
<p>Therefore, there must be a stronger motivation because there will be these disappointments. Rather than trying to have what you want from life, you are able to follow what you know and to give something of greater meaning. This will give you greater meaning, and you will see greater meaning in others. Here compassion is necessary. You will need it in your approach to yourself because you will go through periods of tremendous confusion and at some points disappointment.</p>
<p>因此，必须有更强的动力，因为会有这些失望。与其说你想从生命中得到什么，不如说你能够遵循你所知道的，并给予更有意义的东西。这将给你带来更大的意义，你也会在别人身上看到更大的意义。在这里，同情心是必要的。你在对待自己的时候需要它，因为你会经历巨大的困惑期，在某些时候会有失望。</p>
<p>As you learn to re-evaluate your motives and your current understanding, you will learn to recognize your limits. You will not progress unless these limits are identified. Many people do not want to have their limits pointed out to them. They feel this is an affront to their sense of pride and accomplishment. Yet, real learning requires that you discern where you are. And where you are at the outset is being a beginner who wants to learn but who doesn’t know much. How obvious this is in other forms of education that you are aware of, yet how difficult it is for people to accept that the same thing holds true in learning of the Mystery. Here many people become very proud of all that they have read in books and all of their little experiences. “Oh, yes, I know about this!” and “Oh, yes, I know about that!” and “Oh, I have read about this teacher” and “I know about this school.” They are beginners. But they cannot even be beginners because they won’t accept it.</p>
<p>当你学会重新评估你的动机和你目前的理解时，你将学会认识到你的限制。除非这些限制被识别出来，否则你不会有任何进展。许多人不希望有人向他们指出他们的极限。他们觉得这是对他们的自豪感和成就感的一种侮辱。然而，真正的学习需要你辨别自己的位置。而你一开始所处的位置就是一个想要学习但又不太懂的初学者。在你所知道的其他形式的教育中，这一点是多么明显，但人们却很难接受同样的事情在神秘学的学习中也是如此。在这里，许多人对他们在书中读到的所有内容和他们所有的小经验变得非常自豪。”哦，是的，我知道这个！””哦，是的，我知道那个！””哦，我读过这个老师””我知道这个学校”。他们是初学者。但他们甚至不能成为初学者，因为他们不愿意接受它。</p>
<p>Be a beginner. Not only be a student of Knowledge, but be a beginner! This gives you the greatest motivation, opportunity and ability to learn. This enables you to receive instruction and to give to others without self-glorification, for indeed your sense of pride will be humbled in contrast to the presence of Wisdom and Knowledge. In fact, in The Way of Knowledge, one of the first things that students learn is that they know very little and that they are basing their life on all kinds of assumptions, many of which are unquestioned. In fact, they generally are not even aware of many of their assumptions. They have just followed others and made this assumption and that assumption, and they have wondered why in life they have felt so insecure, so uncertain, so troubled and why their happiness and pleasure were so easily assaulted by changing circumstances and the opinions of others.</p>
<p>做一个初学者。不仅要做内识的学生，还要做一个初学者！这给了你最大的动力，也给了你最大的信心。这给了你最大的学习动力、机会和能力。这使你能够接受指导并给予他人，而不自我炫耀，因为与智慧和内识的存在相比，你的自豪感确实会变得谦逊。事实上，在内识之路中，学生们首先了解到的是，他们所知甚少，他们的生命建立在各种假设之上，其中许多假设是没有疑问的。事实上，他们通常甚至没有意识到自己的许多假设。他们只是跟着其他人做了这个假设和那个假设，他们一直在想，为什么在生活中他们会感到如此不安全，如此不确定，如此麻烦，为什么他们的幸福和快乐如此容易被不断变化的环境和别人的意见所攻击。</p>
<p>If you base your life on assumptions, if you base your identity and your meaning on assumptions, you will feel weak and vulnerable, easily assaulted, defensive, resentful, uncertain and angry. And you will fear dishonesty because you are being dishonest. This is the result of not having a foundation. Becoming a student of Knowledge is to build a real foundation, not an imaginary one, not a fanciful one, not one that you simply pick up inadvertently by growing up in the world, but one that you consciously forge that represents the truth of what you know and what you realize can be practically demonstrated in the world. For this, you must examine yourself and your own experience and learn to evaluate yourself objectively. This also requires learning from others.</p>
<p>如果你把你的生命建立在假设的基础上，如果你把你的身份和意义建立在假设的基础上，你会感到软弱和脆弱，容易受到攻击，防卫性强，怨恨，不确定和愤怒。而且你会害怕不诚实，因为你是不诚实的。这就是没有基础的结果。成为内识的学生，就是要建立一个真正的基础，不是想象中的，不是幻想中的，不是你在这个世界上成长过程中无意中捡到的，而是你有意识地铸造的，代表你所知道的真理和你意识到的可以在这个世界上实际证明的。为此，你必须审视自己和自己的经验，学会客观地评价自己。这也需要向他人学习。</p>
<p>People are teaching you everything not to do in life. Why condemn them? They are a necessary part of your education. They are saving you time. Why condemn them? Every form of self-violation, every expression of fantasy and every blind assumption being acted out are being presented to you if you can see them—not with criticism or condemnation, for criticism and condemnation are easy. They are for people who are protecting their pride and guarding their own assumptions. But if you are able to see with gratitude, compassion and understanding, you will be able to receive this part of your education, which is absolutely fundamental.</p>
<p>人们正在教你生命中不应该做的一切。为什么要谴责他们？他们是你教育的一个必要部分。他们正在为你节省时间。为什么要谴责他们？每一种形式的自我侵犯、每一种幻想的表达和每一种盲目的假设都在呈现给你，如果你能看到它们的话——不是批评或谴责，因为批评和谴责很容易。它们是为那些保护自己的骄傲和守护自己的假设的人准备的。但是，如果你能够以感恩、同情和理解的心态看待，你将能够接受这部分的教育，这绝对是最基础的。</p>
<p>Why spend your life making all of the common mistakes when you can accelerate your learning by observing others? You will still make some mistakes. You will still have to try some things out. And to some degree, you will still have to taste romance and personal power and all of these kinds of things that are so glorified in the world in order to find out how absolutely hollow and lacking they are.</p>
<p>如果你可以通过观察别人来加速你的学习，为什么要用你的生命来犯所有的常见错误？你仍然会犯一些错误。你仍将不得不尝试一些事情。而且在某种程度上，你仍将不得不品尝浪漫和个人权力以及所有这些在世界上被美化的东西，以便发现它们是多么的空洞和缺乏。</p>
<p>Do not simply rely upon your own incentives and values. Observe others. Do not think that you are so different from them. You could make the same mistakes they are making. Perhaps you will think, “Oh, that would never happen to me. I would never do that.” But given the same circumstances and the same inducements, yes, you probably would do that. Yet, why go through it all? Why reinvent what other people are demonstrating to you? You can only learn from them, however, if you observe them objectively, with compassion and without judgment. They are part of the hand that is feeding you, but only if you take a position as a real student can you benefit from their demonstration. Otherwise, you will say these people are good and those people are bad, these people are stupid and those people are smart. A person who is not committed to education will make these kinds of assumptions because they are easy to make and because they are self-congratulating. A student, however, will take a different approach and a far wiser one.</p>
<p>不要简单地依赖你自己的动机和价值观。观察他人。不要认为你和他们有多大区别。你可能会犯他们正在犯的同样的错误。也许你会想，”哦，这永远不会发生在我身上。我永远不会那样做。”但是如果有同样的环境和同样的诱因，是的，你可能会这么做。然而，为什么要经历这一切？为什么要重塑其他人向你展示的东西？然而，你只能从他们身上学习，如果你客观地观察他们，带着同情心，没有判断力。他们是喂养你的那只手的一部分，但只有当你以一个真正的学生的姿态，你才能从他们的示范中受益。否则，你会说这些人是好的，那些人是坏的，这些人是愚蠢的，那些人是聪明的。一个不致力于教育的人将会做出这类假设，因为它们很容易做出，也因为它们是自我陶醉。然而，一名学生会采取不同的方法，而且是更明智的方法。</p>
<p>Observing people is very important, but only with this approach. It is easy to condemn; it is difficult to discern. It is easy to categorize; it is more difficult to leave things unexplained. It is easy to assert your opinions; it is more difficult to alter them. People who do not want to learn choose what is easy; those who want to learn choose what is right, whether it is easy or not.</p>
<p>观察人是非常重要的，但只有采用这种方法。谴责很容易；辨别却很难。归类很容易；让事情不被解释则更难。主张自己的观点很容易；改变观点更难。不想学习的人选择容易的东西；想学习的人选择正确的东西，不管它是否容易。</p>
<p>How can you not have gratitude for the world when it is teaching you the results and the outcome of all of your dispositions that are not guided by Knowledge? Even when people are extreme in their expressions of self-violation, it is about you! This engenders compassion and gratitude, for they are teaching you. They are showing you the outcome of choosing this way over that way, the outcome of believing in this idea or following these compulsions or seeking this form of escape or trying to lose yourself in this interest. They are teaching you, if you can observe them, what it is like to be in this vocation, to assume this role, to have this job or to be in this relationship. If you can learn from life’s great bounty of demonstrations, it will refine your vision and your idea of yourself, leaving you to discover the essence of who you are and what you must do.</p>
<p>当世界在教你所有不受内识指导的处置方式的结果和成果时，你怎么能不对世界心存感激？即使人们在表达自我暴力时很极端，也是为了你！这就产生了同情和感激。这产生了同情心和感激，因为他们在教导你。他们在向你展示选择这种方式而不是那种方式的结果，展示相信这种想法或遵循这些强迫症或寻求这种形式的逃避或试图在这种兴趣中失去自我的结果。如果你能观察到它们，它们在教你从事这种职业、承担这种角色、拥有这种工作或处于这种关系是什么样子。如果你能从生活中大量的示范中学习，它将完善你的视野和你对自己的想法，让你发现你是谁和你必须做什么的本质。</p>
<p>Sometimes you will respond to others with revulsion, but this does not necessarily mean that you are condemning them. It might mean that at the level of Knowledge you are withdrawing from the situation. This does not mean that you have to be loving and happy and open and accepting of everything. It means that you let yourself respond, but you do not judge. There is a very great difference here. You can withdraw from something because you know it is very dangerous or harmful without condemning anyone that you are observing. Likewise, you can feel a natural inclination to move towards some people without glorifying them or placing a higher value upon them over others.</p>
<p>有时你会对他人做出反感的反应，但这不一定意味着你在谴责他们。它可能意味着在内识的层面上，你正在退出这种情况。这并不意味着你必须充满爱和快乐，开放和接受一切。它意味着你让自己做出反应，但你不做判断。这里有一个非常大的区别。你可以退出某件事情，因为你知道它非常危险或有害，而不谴责你所观察到的任何人。同样，你可以感受到一种自然的倾向，走向一些人，而不美化他们，也不把他们的价值看得比别人高。</p>
<p>This represents a natural attraction and resistance that you can feel. This gives you a sense of the instinct of Knowledge. There need not be any judgment or condemnation. It is yes or no, not right or wrong. Right or wrong is what people say when they cannot experience the reality of something or when they feel they must justify their own responses. Instead, just respond. Do not react. You will be motivated to go towards some things and away from others. Towards many other things you will just feel neutral. Stepping back and letting yourself feel this response is very important in learning how to discern others and in finding your way. This gives you an experience of what Knowledge is like.</p>
<p>这代表了你能感觉到的一种自然的吸引力和阻力。这让你感受到了内识的本能。不需要有任何判断或谴责。是或不是，不是对或错。对或错是人们在无法经历到某件事情的真实性时，或者当他们觉得必须为自己的反应辩护时说的。相反，只是回应。不要做出反应。你会被激励着走向一些事情，而远离其他事情。对于许多其他的事情，你将只是感到中立。退后一步，让自己感受到这种反应，对于学习如何辨别他人和寻找自己的道路非常重要。这让你经历到内识是什么样子的。</p>
<p>Give yourself this freedom. Become observant and objective and you will be able to feel your deeper inclinations. In time, you will be able to learn from these inclinations—what they mean, where they are trying to take you, and so forth. It is because you have come here for a purpose and are trying to reach something that you have the need for direction. Your engagement with life, if you are facing life, will teach you your inclinations and your direction. Yet, if you are standing by the side of the road saying, “Well, I do not know what I want. I do not know where to go. I do not know anything,” how can you have any direction? You must be moving to have some direction. If you are stalled by the side of the road, you are not going anywhere, so how can you experience direction? You must get up and do something and go somewhere and engage with life.</p>
<p>给自己这种自由。成为观察者和客观者，你将能够感受到你更深的倾向。随着时间的推移，你将能够从这些倾向中学习——它们意味着什么，它们试图把你带到哪里，等等。正是因为你为了一个目的来到这里，并试图达到某种目的，你才有了对方向的需求。你与生命的接触，如果你面对的是生命，将教会你的倾向和方向。然而，如果你站在路边说：”嗯，我不知道我想要什么。我不知道该去哪里。我什么都不知道，”你怎么能有任何方向呢？你必须移动，才能有一些方向。如果你在路边停滞不前，你哪里也去不了，那么你怎么能经历到方向？你必须站起来做一些事情，去某个地方，参与生命。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will feel foolish and stupid because you do not know what you are doing. Yet, anyone who is approaching Knowledge and has accepted his or her real studenthood must accept this experience. This will temper your pride and develop real openness of mind. If you are trying to be something, do something or have something and that is your overall focus, then how can you be discerning? Everything will be evaluated according to how it fits in with your idea and your image of what you must be, do and have.</p>
<p>也许你会觉得自己很傻很笨，因为你不知道自己在做什么。然而，任何接近内识、接受了自己真正的学生身份的人都必须接受这种经历。这将锤炼你的骄傲，培养真正的开放心态。如果你想成为什么，做什么或拥有什么，这就是你的整体焦点，那么你怎么会有识别能力？一切都将根据它如何符合你的想法和你必须成为、做什么和拥有什么的形象来进行评估。</p>
<p>Discernment requires objectivity. Objectivity requires openness. Openness requires an approach where you are focused on learning rather than acquiring. Here you are facing the world rather than simply trying to use it. Here you will need instruction, and you will need to recognize and profit from the demonstration of error.</p>
<p>辨别力需要客观性。客观性需要开放性。开放性需要一种方法，你专注于学习而不是获取。在这里，你是面对世界，而不是简单地试图利用它。在这里，你将需要指导，你将需要认识到错误的示范并从中获益。</p>
<p>You will also need some great companions. Here you will have to alter what you value in people because the wonderful, the beautiful, the charming, the exciting and the unusual are not what you will seek. Perhaps these represent your former interests in people and the criteria upon which you based your attractions. This will all have to change. Again, you will have to wait for a deeper response. You will have to evaluate people differently, which is different from judging them. You will want to learn what people are capable of and what their inclinations are if you are interested in being in relationship with them. Even with those with whom you feel a spiritual resonance, you must find out if they are able to participate with you and if you have a sufficient degree of compatibility. This requires objective observation. Remember, you are not here to condemn or to glorify them. You simply want to learn. You are going somewhere in life, and you want to know if they can go too. Potential is not enough here. Someone must actually be ready, willing and able to go with you. Trying to rehabilitate someone that you love in order for them to hopefully join you is fruitless. They must go on their own inner direction, not on your prompting. They must go because they realize they must go, not because they are doing it to stay with you.</p>
<p>你还将需要一些伟大的同伴。在这里，你将不得不改变你对人的评价，因为精彩的、美丽的、迷人的、令人兴奋的和不寻常的都不是你将寻求的。也许这些代表了你以前对人的兴趣和你的吸引力所依据的标准。这一切都将不得不改变。同样，你将不得不等待更深入的回应。你将不得不以不同的方式评估人们，这与评判他们是不同的。如果你有兴趣与他们建立关系，你将想了解人们的能力和他们的倾向。即使是与那些你觉得有精神共鸣的人，你也必须找出他们是否能够与你一起参与，以及你们是否有足够程度的兼容性。这需要客观的观察。记住，你在这里不是为了谴责或颂扬他们。你只是想学习。你在生命中要去某个地方，而你想知道他们是否也能去。潜力在这里是不够的。有人必须真正准备好，愿意并能够和你一起走。试图改造你所爱的人，以使他们有希望加入你，是没有结果的。他们必须按照自己内心的方向走，而不是在你的提示下。他们必须去，因为他们意识到他们必须去，而不是因为他们这样做是为了和你呆在一起。</p>
<p>Here, as in learning all things with Knowledge, there is a great process of re-evaluation and a new approach is developed. This is true in all education. All students must go through this. People begin their studenthood with grand expectations and all kinds of assumptions about what they can and cannot do and what it is like to learn and what they will learn and what it will look like. Much of this must be re-evaluated. Here, not only do you have to acquire new skills, you have to acquire a different state of mind.</p>
<p>在这里，就像用内识学习所有的东西一样，有一个极大的重新评估过程，并形成一个新的方法。这在所有的教育中都是如此。所有学生都必须经历这个过程。人们在开始学习的时候，对自己能做什么和不能做什么，学习是什么样子的，他们会学到什么，会是什么样子的，都有宏大的期望和各种假设。这其中的大部分必须重新评估。在这里，你不仅要获得新的技能，还必须获得不同的心智状态。</p>
<p>This is even more true in becoming a student of Knowledge. Do you think you know how it is going to be? Well, it will be different. So, do not try to base your sense of worth upon whether you are correct in your assumptions. Rather, be open and ask for the truth to reveal to you that which you need to learn, that which you need to do, and that which you need to re-evaluate. If you do this, then you can become a person that has real direction, and you will be able to have a meaningful foundation for relationships with others.</p>
<p>在成为内识的学生方面，这一点更是如此。你认为你知道会是怎样的吗？那么，它将是不同的。因此，不要试图将你的价值感建立在你的假设是否正确的基础上。相反，要敞开心扉，要求真理向你揭示你需要学习的东西，你需要做的事情，以及你需要重新评估的想法。如果你这样做，那么你就能成为一个有真正方向的人，你就能有一个有意义的基础与他人建立关系。</p>
<p>Being a real student requires that you not have all the things that you think you want right now. Many people say, “I would love to undertake the study of Knowledge, but I really want to be married. I want to have a partner. And I want to be financially secure.” They are not accepting their studenthood. You go on this journey whether you go alone or accompanied. You go with whatever financial resources you have. You begin where you are. If you add on demands and requirements, you will stop yourself. You go forth because you must go forth, whether or not you have marriage or financial security. Most people want these things, but you must go forth not knowing whether they will be for you or not. This requires courage. This is a demonstration of self-respect. This gives you real integrity. This opens up your ability to learn. If you have been listening and considering the many things that I am presenting in these discourses, you will recognize how important this is.</p>
<p>作为一名真正的学生，要求你不要拥有你认为你现在想要的所有东西。许多人说，”我很想进行内识的学习，但我真的想结婚。我想有一个伴侣。我还想在经济上有保障”。他们没有接受他们的学生身份。无论你是独自一人还是结伴而行，你都要踏上这段旅程。你带着你拥有的任何经济资源去。你从你的位置开始。如果你增加需求和要求，你会停止自己。你去是因为你必须去，无论你是否有婚姻或经济保障。大多数人都想要这些东西，但你必须走出去，不知道它们是否会适合你。这需要勇气。这是自尊的表现。这给了你真正的诚信。这开启了你的学习能力。如果你一直在听和考虑我在这些论述中提出的许多事情，你会认识到这是多么重要。</p>
<p>I am not saying that what you want is wrong. I am saying don’t be committed to getting it. Only be committed to learning Wisdom and reclaiming Knowledge. If you do that, then all that you need will be given to you—not necessarily all that you want, but all that you need. This is the basis for happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>我并不是说你想要的东西是错的。我是说不要致力于得到它。只有致力于学习智慧和重新获得内识。如果你这样做，那么你所需要的一切都会被给予你——不一定是你想要的一切，而是你所需要的一切。这就是幸福和满足的基础。</p>
<p>Look about you in the world. Some people are getting what they want, and many others are not getting what they want. For those who are getting what they want, their happiness and satisfaction are momentary and fleeting. Those who are not getting what they want are in constant complaint and turmoil. The winners and the losers here are not that different in that neither have satisfied their real needs and requirements in life. Those who are committed to getting the money, getting the relationship, getting the position, securing the pleasures—they are investing very poorly. They are everywhere. You can observe them. Are they demonstrating the qualities that you hold to be most valuable? Are they demonstrating a life that is inspiring, that is based upon contribution? Are they discovering their own worth through the contribution of their gifts?</p>
<p>看看你在这个世界上的情况。有些人正在得到他们想要的东西，而其他许多人没有得到他们想要的东西。对于那些得到他们想要的东西的人来说，他们的幸福和满足是短暂的，转瞬即逝的。那些没有得到他们想要的东西的人在不断抱怨和动荡。这里的赢家和输家并没有什么不同，都没有满足他们生命中的真正需要和要求。那些致力于获得金钱、获得关系、获得地位、确保快乐的人——他们的投资非常糟糕。他们无处不在。你可以观察他们。他们是否展示了你认为最有价值的品质？他们是否展示了一种鼓舞人心、基于贡献的生命？他们是否通过贡献自己的礼物发现自己的价值？</p>
<p>Do not condemn them; observe them. They are living in disappointment. They are having what other people are wanting and it is not enough. But it is difficult for them to break away because they have invested so much, and they are still hopeful that the next experience or the next acquisition will somehow relieve them of their disappointment and the sense that what they have given themselves to is without merit.</p>
<p>不要谴责他们；观察他们。他们正生活在失望中。他们拥有别人想要的东西，但这是不够的。但他们很难摆脱，因为他们已经投入了这么多，而且他们仍然希望下一次经历或下一次获得会以某种方式解除他们的失望，以及他们所付出的东西没有价值的感觉。</p>
<p>Students of Knowledge become attentive and observant within and without. They learn this because it is necessary. They seek a deeper direction, and they must patiently wait for this to emerge. In fact, it is often the waiting that is most important for their development. If you can learn to wait, you can learn to trust. If you can learn to trust, you can learn to observe. If you can learn to observe, you can learn to recognize things. This is a very important part of your education.</p>
<p>学习内识的学生会变得细心，对内部和外部进行观察。他们学习这些是因为这是必要的。他们寻求一个更深的方向，他们必须耐心地等待这个方向的出现。事实上，往往是等待对他们的发展最为重要。如果你能学会等待，你就能学会信任。如果你能学会信任，你就能学会观察。如果你能学会观察，你就能学会识别事物。这是你教育的一个非常重要的部分。</p>
<p>Much of what I am saying in these discourses is actually beyond your comprehension and your understanding. Do not try to merely understand it, for if you do that, you will think you understand it, but you will not. Or if you cannot understand it, you may tend to dismiss it or condemn it or condemn yourself. I am not asking you to understand what I mean when I say that the world is emerging into the Greater Community. I am not asking you to understand what I mean when I speak of the Forces of Dissonance and the Forces of Good, The Way of Knowledge or the development of discernment and discretion, courage and compassion. Given where you are, you cannot fully understand these things.</p>
<p>我在这些论述中所说的许多内容实际上超出了你的理解和你的认识。不要试图仅仅理解它，因为如果你那样做，你会认为你理解它，但你不会。或者如果你不能理解它，你可能倾向于否定它或谴责它或谴责你自己。当我说世界正在进入大社区时，我并不要求你理解我的意思。我并不要求你理解我所说的”不和谐的力量”和”善的力量”、”内识之路”或”辨别力和谨慎、勇气和同情心的发展”是什么意思。鉴于你所处的位置，你无法完全理解这些事情。</p>
<p>Accept this. If you do, you will have a real starting point in your learning. I am not asking you to understand. I am asking you to learn. Become a student. If you really want to learn what these things mean, for the world and for yourself, if you want to learn and discover who sent you here and what you were given to provide, if you want to learn to discern your nature and to learn to work with it wisely and effectively, then become a student. I offer a greater body of Wisdom and a greater challenge. An observer or a critic or a dabbler will not be able to benefit from this. But those who accept their studenthood in life and take this position constantly and maintain it will be the ones who will be able to achieve the state of mind where all of these things become obvious.</p>
<p>接受这一点。如果你这样做，你的学习就会有一个真正的起点。我不是要求你理解。我是要求你学习。成为一名学生。如果你真的想学习这些东西对世界和你自己意味着什么，如果你想学习并发现谁把你送到这里，以及你被赋予了什么，如果你想学习辨别你的本性并学习明智有效地与之合作，那么就成为一名学生。我提供了一个更大的智慧和更大的挑战。观察者、批评者或涉猎者将无法从中受益。但是那些在生命中接受自己的学生身份，不断采取这种立场并保持这种立场的人，将能够达到所有这些事情都变得明显的心智状态。</p>
<p>To see what I see and to know what I know you must have my vantage point, and you must have the clarity of mind that I have had to acquire. To do this you must become a student. Even I am a student. Mastery here is relative. Even the masters are students of greater mastery.</p>
<p>要看到我所看到的，要知道我所知道的，你必须拥有我的观测点，你必须拥有必须获得的清晰心智。要做到这一点，你必须成为一名学生。甚至我也是一名学生。这里的掌握是相对的。即使是大师也是更大的大师的学生。</p>
<p>Be a student and you will learn and you will know and you will be able to act. Anything less than this will leave you outside the realm of true discovery. Yet the opportunity is yours, an opportunity that you can now receive.</p>
<p>成为一个学生，你将学习，你将知道，你将能够行动。任何不如此的方式都会让你处于真正发现的领域之外。然而，这个机会是你的，是你现在可以获得的机会。</p>
