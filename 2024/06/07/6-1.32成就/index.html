<p>I would like to speak about achievement and relationship. Sometimes people are uncomfortable with the things I say. To a certain degree, this cannot be helped because not everyone likes everything. Sometimes I put a little pebble in your shoe, so to speak, because it is good to think about things. Often when you are engaged in discussing very important matters, it is very easy to maintain self-comforting ideas and to rely upon them to answer all the controversies that may arise. To penetrate the real truth within your life, however, sometimes you must let these controversies rage a little and see what happens. Sometimes you must think very carefully about your own assumptions and be able to distinguish your assumptions from those things you really know to be true. In other words, you must distinguish between belief and direct experience.</p>
<p>我想谈一谈成就和关系。有时人们会对我说的话语感到不舒服。在某种程度上，这是没办法的，因为不是每个人都喜欢所有的东西。有时我在你的鞋子里放一颗小石子，可以这么说，因为思考问题是件好事。通常当你从事讨论非常重要的事情时，很容易保持自我安慰的想法，并依靠它们来回答所有可能出现的争议。然而，为了深入了解你生命中的真正真相，有时你必须让这些争议肆虐一下，看看会发生什么。有时你必须非常仔细地思考你自己的假设，并能够将你的假设与那些你真正知道的真实知道区分开来。换句话说，你必须把信仰和直接经历区分开来。</p>
<p>Life is very intelligent. It is always conspiring to move you into a larger sphere of experience. A part of each person always wants to stay in a smaller sphere of experience, which is actually not experience at all. It is merely a realm of self-assuring ideas. Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to sort of break things up a little, to bring in some new ideas or say some things that are challenging. This is healthy. Here there must be trust that if something that is held very deeply is challenged, there is something else within you that is really sound, true and stable. You are all trying to get to that because that is where all true meaning and direction come from.</p>
<p>生命是非常聪明的。它总是在密谋让你进入一个更大的经历领域。每个人的一部分总是想停留在一个较小的经历范围内，这实际上根本不是经历。它只是一个自我保证的想法的领域。因此，有时候有必要打破一些东西，带来一些新的想法或说一些具有挑战性的事情。这是很健康的。这里必须有一种信任，即如果非常深刻地持有的东西受到挑战，在你里面还有一些真正健全、真实和稳定的东西。你们都在试图达到这一点，因为那是所有真实意义和方向的来源。</p>
<p>When you experience life, it is always interpretive. In other words, what you see is interpretive. What you hear is interpretive. What you feel from within yourself is interpretive. However, the Source of Knowledge within you is not interpretive and the more that you can set aside interpretation, the greater your direct experience of life will be. This will give you a vision of life that is quite profound and extremely useful. You will be able to perceive situations around you with greater clarity of mind. You will be able to see what is there rather than what you want to be there because your preferences are exerting less influence upon you. This makes your vision clearer and your presence more powerful.</p>
<p>当你经历生命时，它总是解释性的。换句话说，你看到的是解释性的。你听到的是解释性的。你从自己内心感受到的想法是解释性的。然而，你内心的内识之源不是解释性的，你越能抛开解释，你对生命的直接经历就越大。这将给你一个相当深刻的、极其有用的生活视野。你将能够以更清晰的心灵感知你周围的情况。你将能够看到存在的东西，而不是你希望存在的东西，因为你的偏好对你的影响较小。这使你的视野更清晰，你的存在更有力。</p>
<p>There are many popular spiritual ideas that are very deeply cherished, and people often think that these are not ideas but absolute truths themselves. But they are really ideas. Anything your mind settles on is an idea. What is most important is where true ideas come from. That is why we have often said, “Do not be content with ideas alone.” Whether they be comforting or not, find out where they come from. That is the great opportunity.</p>
<p>有许多流行的精神理念被人们深深珍视，人们常常认为这些不是理念，而是绝对真理本身。但它们确实是想法。你的心灵所确定的任何东西都是一种想法。最重要的是真实的想法来自哪里。这就是为什么我们经常说，”不要仅仅满足于想法”。无论它们是否令人欣慰，都要找出它们的来源。这就是伟大的机会。</p>
<p>You have all come here to achieve something. It is a possibility. There are no guarantees that you will do it in this life because that is up to you. You have all come to do something specific. By achieving that, you will be able to end separation within yourself and therefore be able to complete your work at this level. However, this thing you have come to do is not so obvious. Do not say, “I know what it is already. It is to do this!” That may be a very comforting idea, but not very helpful. If you sense that you have something in life that you must achieve, it is important that there is someone in your life who loves you enough to challenge you when that is necessary, to comfort you when that is necessary and to reassure you when that is necessary.</p>
<p>你来到这里都是为了取得一些成就。它是一种可能性。没有人保证你在这一生中会做到，因为这取决于你。你们都是来做一些特定的事情。通过实现这一点，你们将能够结束自己内心的分离，因此能够完成你们在这个层面的工作。然而，你们来做的这件事并不那么明显。不要说：”我已经知道它是什么了。就是要做这件事！”这可能是一个非常舒适的想法，但不是很有帮助。如果你感觉到你在生命中有一些必须实现的东西，那么在你的生命中必须有一个足够爱你的人，在必要时挑战你，在必要时安慰你，在必要时让你放心。</p>
<p>An achievement has two aspects: the first is realization, the second is accomplishment. You cannot separate them. They must happen together. Some people want the realization without the responsibility of the accomplishment. Many people want to experience accomplishment and just bypass the realization. “Just tell me what it is. I’ll go do it tomorrow. Or maybe I’ll do it tonight, if it is important. Just tell me what it is. Tell me what to do!” So, in my discourses I have given some very lofty goals to achieve. They are not so easy, but they are worthwhile. I want everyone here to aim very high in life, perhaps higher than you think you can go. That is good.</p>
<p>成就有两个方面：第一个是实现，第二个是成就。你不能把它们分开。它们必须同时发生。有些人希望实现但不想承担成就的责任。许多人希望体验成就，而只是绕过实现。“告诉我应该做什么，我明天就去做。或者如果很重要的话，也许今晚就去做。告诉我应该做什么！”。因此，在我的讲辞中，我提出了一些非常崇高的目标要实现。它们并不那么容易，但它们是值得的。我希望在座的每个人在生活中都能定得非常高的目标，也许比你认为自己能达到的还要高。那是很好的。</p>
<p>The realization is very important because it gives you the power of accomplishment. It also resolves many other issues that can be very substantial in themselves. The accomplishment is very important because here you leave your mark upon the world. Then you achieve a satisfaction that very few people will ever achieve. You have completed something that is absolutely fundamental to your being here. There is satisfaction even in approaching the accomplishment and in all the various stages of the accomplishment. Here you do not need to question your reality. You do not need to continually ask the same question, “What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?” You are able to give yourself increasingly to a primary focus in life, and that in itself ends conflict.</p>
<p>实现是非常重要的，因为它给了你成就感的力量。它还能解决许多其他问题，这些问题本身可能是非常实质性的。成就是非常重要的，因为在这里你会在世界上留下你的印记。然后你就获得了一种很少有人能达到的满足感。你已经完成了一些对你在这里的存在绝对重要的事情。甚至在接近成就的过程中，以及在成就的各个阶段都有满足感。在这里，你不需要质疑你的现实。你不需要不断地问同一个问题：”我在做什么？我正在做什么？我在做什么？”你能够把自己越来越多地交给生命中的一个主要焦点，这本身就结束了冲突。</p>
<p>There is something else very important about achievement. You must be extremely concentrated, not only concentrated in terms of your perspective, but concentrated in terms of your life force. You must have tremendous vitality to go in the direction that you must go. You will find this quality apparent in all individuals who are achieving something important in any area—a tremendous concentration of energy and focus.</p>
<p>关于完成成就，还有一些非常重要的品质。你必须非常集中，不仅是在你的观点方面集中，而且在你的生命力方面集中。你必须有巨大的生命力，才能朝着你必须去的方向前进。你会发现这种品质在所有在任何领域取得重要成就的人身上都很明显——能量的巨大集中和专注。</p>
<p>When you learn to concentrate, you find out it is not so easy to do if you are not used to it. At first, it can seem very self-limiting to concentrate like this, but as you proceed, it begins to generate spiritual power in your life and to harmonize your outer affairs. In fact, this concentration requires that other things be resolved. This begins to generate a tremendous build-up of power that is quite essential for your achievement.</p>
<p>当你学会集中能量时，你会发现，如果你不习惯，就不容易做到。起初，像这样集中能量似乎非常自我限制，但随着你的进行，它开始在你的生命中产生精神力量，并使你的外部事务和谐。事实上，这种专注需要解决其他事情。这开始产生一种巨大的力量积累，对你完成成就相当重要。</p>
<p>To achieve anything in this life, you must exert tremendous energy to do it, and yet the achievement that we are speaking of is not only an achievement based upon your own ability, but the achievement of carrying a Greater Power in your life that far exceeds anything that you individually can do alone. But the Greater Power cannot do this without your development as a vehicle and your development as a partner. This is very exciting!</p>
<p>要想在这一生中取得任何成就，你必须付出巨大的能量去做，然而我们所说的成就不仅是基于你自己能力的成就，而且是在你的生命中携带一种更大力量的成就，这种力量远远超过了你个人能够单独做到的事情。但是，如果没有你作为载体的发展和你作为伙伴的发展，更伟大的力量就无法做到这一点。这是非常令人激动的!</p>
<p>Very few will actually be the seed people for the accomplishment. They will require a community of people to help them do whatever it is given them to do, and everyone who can help them will be uplifted in doing that.</p>
<p>很少有人会真正成为成就的种子人。他们将需要一个群体来帮助他们做任何给他们做的事，而每个能帮助他们的人都会在做这件事时得到提升。</p>
<p>When you are concentrated, you will have power. Whether it be for good or for ill, you will have power. Those who are committed to destruction can be very concentrated. That is why they are so influential. If the general population is not concentrated, either individually or collectively, it can be easily manipulated. This is sad but true.</p>
<p>当你集中能量的时候，你就会有力量。无论是好事还是坏事，你都会有力量。那些致力于破坏的人可以非常集中。这就是为什么他们有如此大的影响力。如果普通民众不集中，无论是个人还是集体，都很容易被操纵。这很可悲，但却是事实。</p>
<p>Therefore, if you wish to make a contribution in life, it is very important to increase your concentration on your power and development. This means pulling yourself in and focusing your emphasis on only one or two areas. This magnifies your presence and power and brings about resolution to your conflicts. When you are truly engaged in achievement, you are concentrating on what is essential. What is essential is gaining your attention and involvement. This concentrates your life, and with concentration comes the resolution of conflict. More and more of yourself is aiming in one direction, and there is less and less division internally.</p>
<p>因此，如果你希望在生活中做出贡献，提高你对自己力量和发展的集中度是非常重要的。这意味着把自己拉进来，只把重点放在一个或两个领域。这可以放大你的存在和力量，并为你的冲突带来解决。当你真正参与到成就中时，你就会把注意力集中在至关重要的事情上。至关重要的东西正在获得你的关注和参与。这集中了你的生命，而随着集中，冲突的解决也随之而来。你自己越来越多地瞄准一个方向，内部的分裂也越来越少。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is for people who know they must carry on in achieving what they came here to achieve. Beyond their personal preferences or desire for comfort, there is something now that is driving them forward, and they must proceed. The Way of Knowledge is for these people.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路是为那些知道他们必须继续实现他们来到这里要实现的目标的人准备的。除了他们的个人喜好或对舒适的渴望，现在有一些东西在推动他们前进，他们必须继续前进。内识之路就是为这些人准备的。</p>
<p>We wish to give a very honest and clear picture of what true preparation is and what it requires. Then people can become more honest about the issue of achievement. Now, in normal conversation people talk about the great things that they want to achieve or intend to achieve or will achieve someday or should achieve, and so forth. The word “commitment” is used very lightly here, and the word “dedication” is used very lightly. These things deserve reverence. Indeed they do. When you have a taste of what it really means to be committed and devoted, to be inner-directed and to give yourself completely to something, then you will see the difference and how important it is.</p>
<p>我们希望给出一个非常诚实和清晰的画面，说明什么是真实的准备，以及它需要什么。然后人们就可以在完成成就的问题上变得更加诚实。现在，在正常的谈话中，人们会谈论他们想要实现或打算实现或有朝一日会实现或应该实现的伟大事情，等等。这里”承诺”一词用得很轻，”奉献”一词用得也很轻。这些事情值得敬重。的确，它们确实如此。当你尝到了承诺和奉献的真正含义，尝到了内心的指引，尝到了为某件事情完全奉献自己，那么你就会看到差别，看到它有多么重要。</p>
<p>Somehow you must find your place in life and you must find a way to gain access to that part of you that has come here to achieve something. It is not true that you are here merely to make up for past mistakes. It is not true that you are here merely to resolve personal dilemmas. That is not true! That is a very limited viewpoint. It does not hold respect for your origin, your Source or your true Community beyond this world.</p>
<p>你必须以某种方式找到你在生命中的位置，你必须找到一种方法来获得你的那一部分，它来到这里是为了实现一些东西。你在这里只是为了弥补过去的错误，这不是真的。你在这里只是为了解决个人的困境，这不是真的。它不是真的！这是很有限的观点。那是一个非常有限的观点。它不尊重你的起源、你的源头或你在这个世界之外的真实社区。</p>
<p>Often we have spoken of Spiritual Family, and we would like to say a few words about this because many people who have heard this are not yet certain what I mean. In life thus far, you have had a physical family, a family of the world that has made it possible for you to be born, to be raised and to be educated in the ways of the world. Likewise, you have a Spiritual Family that is waiting to prepare you, to activate your spiritual life and your Knowledge while you are here in the world. All sparks of achievement come from beyond the world. The achievement may have a very physical manifestation. It may have a very mundane application, but the inspiration for it has come from beyond the world—all achievements for good, that is.</p>
<p>我们经常谈到精神家庭，我们想就此说几句，因为许多人听到这句话后，还不确定我的意思。在迄今为止的生命中，你有一个物质的家庭，一个世界的家庭，它使你们有可能出生、长大，并以世界的方式接受教育。同样，你也有一个精神家庭，当你在这个世界上时，它正等待着为你做准备，激活你的精神生命和内识。所有成就的火花都来自于世界之外。成就可能有一个非常实际的表现形式。它可能有一个非常平凡的应用，但它的灵感来自于世界之外——所有的成就都是好的，也就是说。</p>
<p>Therefore, you have a physical family, a worldly family, that has raised you from birth and that has educated you to prepare you to be in life. Maybe they did not do such a good job, but that is beside the point. Then you have a Spiritual Family from which you are born into a new world. Here you develop and you become educated so that you can become a spiritual presence in life.</p>
<p>因此，你有一个有形的家庭，一个世俗的家庭，从出生开始就抚养你，教育你，为你的生命做准备。也许他们没有做得那么好，但这是题外话。然后你有一个精神家庭，你从那里出生到一个新的世界。在这里你得到发展，你得到教育，以便你能成为生命中的精神存在。</p>
<p>Now, when you first begin to realize this process, it is very important to know that you will be like a child in this new realm. Like all little children, you will want everything but will actually have the capacity for very little. Here it takes time to understand how your wants are relative and dependent upon your capacity. Even though a little child wants to have everything interesting for themselves, they must learn what things are and what things are for good and what things are not for good. They must develop a capacity for having things and for being responsible.</p>
<p>现在，当你第一次开始意识到这个过程时，非常重要的是要知道，你在这个新领域将像一个孩子。像所有的小孩子一样，你会想要一切，但实际上你的能力非常小。这里需要时间来理解你的愿望是如何相对的，并取决于你的能力。尽管一个小孩子想拥有一切有趣的东西，但他们必须学会什么是东西，什么东西是好的，什么东西是不好的。他们必须发展拥有东西和负责任的能力。</p>
<p>The same is true with your spiritual development. At the beginning you want it all. “I want it all!” But you cannot really receive very much yet because your capacity is quite limited and your education has not been brought about. So, you must be raised within your Spiritual Family and educated as well so that you can assume the responsibilities.</p>
<p>你的精神发展也是如此。开始时，你想要一切。”我想拥有一切！”但你还不能真正得到很多，因为你的能力相当有限，你的教育还没有带来。所以，你必须在你的精神家庭中得到提高，也要接受教育，以便你能承担起责任。</p>
<p>Therefore, we wish to talk about achievement in terms of your Spiritual Family and your Ancient Heritage, which you are privileged to bring into this world from beyond. We applaud all achievement for good in life. Yet our role is to cultivate a greater level of achievement. To prepare for this requires a great deal, yet whatever it requires is small compared to what it gives. It is an achievement that at the outset looks very intangible. You do not quite know what you are doing. It is not like building a better car or a business. That all seems very predictable. In these cases, many of the steps seem to be laid out in front of you. You merely need to follow them and be intelligent and committed to what you are doing.</p>
<p>因此，我们希望从你的精神家庭和你的古老遗产方面谈一谈成就，你有幸从外面带到这个世界。我们赞扬所有在生活中取得的良好成就。然而我们的作用是培养更高水平的成就。为这做准备需要很多东西，但无论需要什么，与它所给予的相比都是小事。这是一项在开始时看起来非常无形的成就。你不太知道你在做什么。它不像建造一辆更好的汽车或一个企业。那看起来都是非常可预测的。在这些情况下，许多步骤似乎已经摆在你面前了。你只需要遵循它们，并对你正在做的事情充满智慧和承诺。</p>
<p>In the reclamation of your true Spiritual Heritage, however, the process of achievement is much more mysterious. The steps are not so evident at the beginning. You enter because something inside of you is moving you to do that. To trust this requires that you learn to relinquish self-hatred and self-doubt and begin to honor the Spiritual Presence that is emerging inside of you. You are taken through various stages of initiation. Then, anything you do will have a lasting impact on the world, not only because of what you may do physically, but because of the state of mind that you are in.</p>
<p>然而，在开垦你真实的精神遗产方面，完成成就的过程要神秘得多。这些步骤在开始时并不明显。你进入的原因是你内心的某种东西在推动你这样做。要相信这一点，需要你学会放弃自我憎恨和自我怀疑，并开始尊重正在你体内出现的精神存在。你会被带去经历各种阶段的启动。然后，你所做的任何事情都会对世界产生持久的影响，不仅是因为你可能在身体上所做的事情，而且是因为你所处的心智状态。</p>
<p>Achieving this state of mind, in essence, is the greatest achievement, but it requires the greatest preparation as well. We don’t expect this achievement of all people. In fact, we only aim at a few people, but everyone who is closely aligned with these individuals will be raised as well. So, our job is to initiate these individuals, and for everyone else we offer important ideas.</p>
<p>实现这种心智状态，从本质上讲，是最大的成就，但也需要最大的准备。我们并不期望所有的人都能取得这种成就。事实上，我们只针对少数人，但与这些人密切相关的每个人也会得到提升。因此，我们的工作是启动这些人，而对于其他人，我们提供重要的想法。</p>
<p>In order to do something important in life, your life must become simplified, directed and more concentrated. If I say to someone, “Go become a surgeon,” well, becoming a surgeon requires a great deal. It is not something you can do in your spare time. That is achievement.</p>
<p>为了在生活中做一些重要的事情，你的生活必须变得简化，有方向，更集中。如果我对某人说，”去成为一名外科医生”，那么，成为一名外科医生需要很多技能。这不是你可以在业余时间做的事情。那是成就。</p>
<p>Therefore, with all the talk of achievement and people’s expectations of others for achievement and the expectations of the human race for achievement, it is very important to see what achievement really is and what it requires. That is why I want to talk now about relationships.</p>
<p>因此，在所有关于成就的讨论中，在人们对他人的成就和人类对成就的期望中，看到什么是真正的成就以及它需要什么是非常重要的。这就是为什么我现在想谈一谈关系。</p>
<p>There is something very important to see when you look at people who are involved in great achievements. Often they are not very well-rounded people. They are very advanced in one area and not so advanced in other areas. In terms of purely worldly achievement, this is always the case. But in terms of achievement at a higher level, this cannot be the case. Purely worldly achievement requires using relationships to bring about an intended result, but achievement at a higher level has an entirely different emphasis on relationship. Here relationship is the result. What you achieve, you achieve in relationship. If you happen to build a building, or bridge or hospital, that is secondary. In fact, people who are achieving this mysterious thing I am talking about rarely do anything! They don’t leave lasting things. They leave lasting relationships. Did Jesus Christ build anything? Did he carve his initials anywhere? Buddha, what did he do that is tangible? What is their achievement? They made it possible for many people to achieve. They ignited relationships at a very high level.</p>
<p>看待从事伟大成就的人时，有一点非常重要。通常他们并不是非常全面发展的人。他们在某个领域非常先进，但在其他领域可能并不那么出色。就纯粹世俗成就而言，情况总是如此。但在更高层次的成就方面，情况就不同了。纯粹的世俗成就需要利用关系来实现预期结果，但在更高层次的成就中，关系有着完全不同的重要性。在这里，关系本身就是成果。你取得的成就是在关系中取得的。如果你建造了一座建筑、桥梁或医院，那只是次要的。事实上，那些在实现我所谈论的神秘事物的人很少做任何事情！他们并没有留下持久的东西。他们留下了持久的关系。耶稣基督建造过什么吗？他在哪里刻过他的名字缩写？佛陀，他做过什么具体的事情？他们的成就是什么？他们让许多人有可能取得成就。他们在非常高层次上点燃了关系。</p>
<p>Of course, people do very stupid things too, but that must be expected. You cannot judge a teaching based upon what people do with it, and anyone who is giving the teaching must know this. They must know that it will be horribly disfigured by subsequent practitioners. This is a very important thing to think about.</p>
<p>当然，人们也做了非常愚蠢的事情，但这必须在意料之中。你不能根据人们对它的所作所为来判断一个教导，任何给予教导的人必须知道这一点。他们必须知道，它将被后来的实践者可怕地毁掉。这是一个需要思考且非常重要的事情。</p>
<p>So, a person who is involved in worldly achievement will use relationships to meet his or her aim. But for a higher level of achievement, relationships are the aim and those who achieve this level of relationship will leave the greatest imprint, the most lasting effect. They will produce a movement that will stay in motion for a very long time.</p>
<p>因此，一个追求世俗成就的人会利用关系来达到他或她的目标。但对于更高层次的成就，关系本身就是目标，那些达到这种关系层次的人将留下最深刻的印记，最持久的影响。他们将引发一个运动，这个运动将长时间持续下去。</p>
<p>All of this is very relevant to what you want to do with your life. Do you want to squander your life seeking little things which do not satisfy you, or do you want to concentrate on something very important? Many people seem to be happy with little things. That is okay. But these people usually don’t read books such as these. People respond to my words because they have a deeper hunger that has manifested itself, at least to some degree. Many people are merely curious. “I want to see what this is,” and then they laugh about it later. That is okay. People laugh all the time about the truth. I don’t mind. Then other people respond because something is stirring in their lives, and they must do something about it. They must give it recognition and validation, and that is good.</p>
<p>所有这些都与你想用你的生命做什么非常相关。你是想挥霍你的生命去追求那些不能满足你的小事，还是想集中能量做一些非常重要的事情？许多人似乎以小事为乐。那是可以的。但这些人通常不读像这样的书。人们对我的话作出反应，是因为他们有一个更深的饥饿感，至少在某种程度上表现出来。许多人只是好奇。”我想看看这是什么，”然后他们后来就笑了。这也没什么。人们一直在嘲笑真理。我并不介意。然后其他人作出反应，因为有东西在他们的生命中搅动，他们必须对它做些什么。他们必须给予它认可和验证，这很好。</p>
<p>If you want to achieve something tangible, then all you have to do is dedicate all your time and energy to doing that and use all of your talents and the talents of other people to help you, and you will make a strong impression in life. There are other factors involved in this, but generally that is it. It is not that difficult! But to achieve a greater achievement in the realm of relationship, well, that is something else. Here you cannot have part of you being an idiot and another little part of you being brilliant and be a brilliant idiot who can only do one thing very well and be handicapped in everything else.</p>
<p>如果你想要实现某种有形的成就，那么你只需要将所有的时间和能量都投入到这个目标中，并利用你自己和其他人的所有才能来帮助你，你将在生活中留下深刻的印记。当然，在这个过程中还有其他因素，但总的来说就是这样。这并不难！但要在关系领域取得更大的成就，那就是另一回事了。在这里，你不能让自己的一部分是愚蠢的，另一部分是聪明的，成为一个只擅长做一件事的聪明愚蠢者，而在其他方面又是个庸才。</p>
<p>Our emphasis, then, is on this greater achievement. Any step in this direction makes you more powerful, more generous, wiser and more efficacious in life. Here you must be concentrated, but your focus is much more mysterious. Your poor mind won’t have much to hold onto because your Spirit will be moving things. That is good. It is a different kind of training, a different preparation for a different goal. Here you will achieve something that affects the Mystery of life, where all meaning comes from. In tangible matters you are focusing on something physical that needs to happen. That is very commendable, and I do not want to belittle it. But these two levels of achievement are in different realms.</p>
<p>那么，我们的重点是在这个更大的成就上。在这个方向上的任何一步都会使你在生命中更有力量，更慷慨，更有智慧，更有效率。在这里，你必须集中能量，但你的注意力要神秘得多。你可怜的心灵不会有太多的牵挂，因为你的精神会推动成就。这很好。这是一种不同的训练，为一个不同的目标做不同的准备。在这里，你将实现一些影响生命之谜的东西，所有的意义来自于此。在实实在在的事情上，你关注的是需要发生的一些实际情况。这是非常值得赞扬的，我不想贬低它。但这两个层次的成就是在不同的领域。</p>
<p>To see where you are aiming yourself, you must become aware of your own nature. If you think that your life was to achieve something and it hasn’t happened so far, well, it’s a good chance that that is not your goal. People say, “Well, I would be so magnificent if only I had no barriers!” I cannot tell you what a ridiculous thing it is to think like that. This is not helpful. What this says is that your barriers have all the power, and who you are is something meek, only a potentiality. It belittles what is real and gives great weight and authority to what is not real. This is not helpful! You will always end up condemning yourself and justifying error, so please do not think like that.</p>
<p>要看清自己的目标，你必须意识到自己的本性。如果你认为你的生命是为了实现某事而存在，而目前还未实现，那么很可能这并不是你的目标。人们常说：“如果没有障碍，我将会变得如此伟大！”我无法告诉你这种想法有多么荒谬。这种想法并不有益。这意味着你的障碍拥有全部的力量，而你所是的只是温顺的潜能。这贬低了现实，赋予了虚幻重大的权威。这并不有益！你将一直在谴责自己，为错误辩护，请不要有这样的想法。</p>
<p>There are always barriers. You will always have limitations in this life. You will have psychological limitations and physical limitations. This ceases to be such a problem when you are involved in something greater, however. That is why, in the most practical sense, true healing deals with being involved in something greater. When you have nothing greater to be involved in, you fall back on your wants and your fears. That is the prison house because what you want in that little realm is hardly enough to satisfy you. And so there is a constant war within yourself to achieve little things which you do not really want anyway. True resolution comes when you are assuming something greater that pulls you out of this morass and allows you to concentrate, which you must do.</p>
<p>总是有障碍。你在这一生中总是会有限制。你将有心理上的限制和身体上的限制。然而，当你参与到更大的现实中时，这就不再是一个问题了。这就是为什么在最实际的意义上，真实的医治涉及到参与到更大的现实中。当你没有更大的现实可以参与时，你就会退回到你的愿望和恐惧中。这就是监狱，因为你在那个小领域里想要的东西几乎不足以满足你。因此，在你的内心深处有一场持续的战争，以实现那些你并不真正想要的小东西。当你假设有更大的东西把你从这个泥潭中拉出来，让你集中能量时，真正的解决才会出现，这是你必须做的。</p>
<p>I have often given the example of the house on fire because if the house were on fire, everyone would jump into high gear. Who cares if you wanted a soul mate? House on fire! Who cares if you wanted more pay for your job? House on fire! Who cares if you wanted a body that never aches? House on fire! Everyone goes into gear. Do you wonder why people let situations become intolerable? That is a very marked tendency in human beings, both individually and collectively. People wait until the situation is dire because then everyone must go into action. But you cannot thrive upon catastrophe alone. Emergency is not enough to give you a sense of real purpose in life. Desperation is not a good foundation to live upon.</p>
<p>我经常举出房子着火的例子，因为如果房子着火了，每个人都会跳到高位。谁在乎你是否想要一个灵魂伴侣？房子着火了!谁在乎你是否想在工作中获得更多报酬？房子着火了!谁在乎你是否想要一个永不疼痛的身体？房子着火了!每个人都进入了状态。你想知道为什么人们会让情况变得不可容忍吗？这是人类的一个非常明显的倾向，无论是个人还是集体。人们等到形势严峻的时候，因为那时每个人都必须投入行动。但是，你不能仅仅依靠灾难而兴旺发达。紧急情况不足以让你有真正的生命目的感。绝望不是赖以生存的良好基础。</p>
<p>You are remarkably free to consider what you really want to achieve in life. The Way of Knowledge gives you a perspective on the Greater Community of Worlds in order to illustrate your remarkable freedom in this world and how much we encourage you to take advantage of it. Most of the universe on the physical level is enslaved in contrast to your life, which is relatively free and casual. Often, teaching greater things works better with people who are enslaved because they take it more seriously, but it takes longer for them to move into a position where they can actually do something with it.</p>
<p>你可以非常自由地考虑你在生活中真正想要实现什么。内识之路给了你一个关于大社区的视角，以说明你在这个世界上的非凡自由，以及我们多么鼓励你利用它。宇宙在物理层面上的大部分都是被奴役的，与你的生活形成对比，你的生活是相对自由和随意的。通常情况下，教更伟大的东西对被奴役的人效果更好，因为他们更认真地对待它，但他们需要更长的时间来进入一个他们能真正用它做什么的位置。</p>
<p>You are very free. So what do you want to do? You can have little things, but they are not very satisfying. You live in a spiritual and a mental world as well as a physical one. To be fully responsible means that you are accountable in all three realms. Here you do not neglect the physical because you are only interested in spiritual matters. Likewise, you do not neglect the mental because you are only interested in physical things. Achievement, at the level that I am pointing to, requires accountability in all three realms. Achievement on a purely physical level, a manifest level, requires accountability only in the physical and the mental realms, though in the mental realm it may not require a great deal. If you are clever, rational and patient, you can do a great deal because there is not much competition.</p>
<p>你非常自由。那么你想做什么呢？你可以拥有一些微不足道的东西，但它们并不令人满足。你生活在一个精神、心理和物质世界中。要完全负责任意味着你在这三个领域都要承担责任。在这里，你不会因为只对精神事务感兴趣而忽视物质层面。同样，你也不会因为只对物质事物感兴趣而忽视心理层面。在我所指的层面上取得成就需要在这三个领域都负责。在纯粹物质层面上取得成就，即显现层面上，只需要在物质和心理领域负责，尽管在心理领域可能不需要太多责任。如果你聪明、理性和耐心，你可以做很多事情，因为竞争并不激烈。</p>
<p>Sometimes, people think that I am too hard on everyone, but I am not. I am too easy on everyone. The reason I seem too hard is that I know who you are. So, I offer great things. If I did not think you were great, I would offer little things. If I thought people were sort of stupid, I would offer things for stupid people. But because people are great, I offer things that are great. You must do something great to know you are great because this is a world where things are done. When things are done, they are demonstrated and that is the level of teaching here. When things are demonstrated, that is achievement!</p>
<p>有时候，人们认为我对每个人都太苛刻了，但事实并非如此。我对每个人都太宽容了。我看起来过于苛刻的原因是因为我知道你是谁。因此，我提供伟大的成就。如果我认为你不伟大，我会提供一些微不足道的成就。如果我认为人们有点愚蠢，我会提供愚蠢的东西。但因为人们是伟大的，我提供伟大的成就。你必须做一些伟大的事情才能知道自己是伟大的，因为这是一个需要行动的世界。当成就被完成时，它们就被展示出来，这就是这里的教学水平。当成果被展示出来时，那就是成就！</p>
<p>We teach about relationship. Anytime people come together based upon the deeper impulse of Knowledge, something remarkable happens. But because this does not happen very often, it seems to be too rare to rely upon. This requires that you re-evaluate relationships and what attracts people to each other. Here demonstration is very important. People come together for many reasons. Much of this is for unlearning things. It is for disillusionment. This is not easy, and though we wish to save people these pains, we can only do so much. When you become tired of little things that are temporary and that do not last, there is a good chance in a very sober moment you will say, “Oh, my God, this is my life! What am I doing with my life?” And then you will perhaps stumble across something that has been waiting for you all along. Disappointment always opens a door, and it can be a remarkably rewarding experience if you can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>我们教的是关系。任何时候人们基于内识的更深层的冲动走到一起，都会有非凡的事情发生。但由于这种情况并不经常发生，所以似乎太少了，无法依靠。这就要求你重新评估关系，以及是什么吸引了人们彼此之间的关系。在这里，示范是非常重要的。人们走到一起有很多原因。这其中大部分是为了解除对关系的学习。它是为了幻灭。这并不容易，尽管我们希望拯救人们的这些痛苦，但我们只能做这么多。当你对那些暂时的、不持久的小事感到厌倦时，很有可能在一个非常清醒的时刻你会说：”哦，我的上帝，这就是我的生命！”。我的生命在做什么？”然后你也许会偶然发现一直在等待你的东西。失望总是打开一扇门，如果你能利用它，它可以是一个非常有价值的经验。</p>
<p>Sometimes people only want temporary comfort in relationship. Sometimes people want an extended holiday. Sometimes people want something really lasting. It is very important to look and see what you want in this regard because relationships that are based upon Knowledge will be lasting. Their effects will be with you forever, even beyond this life. That is how permanent these relationships are. The discernment that you need to develop will give you a real sense of their contrast to everything else.</p>
<p>有时人们只想在关系中得到暂时的安慰。有时人们想要一个延长的假期。有时人们想要真正持久的关系。在这方面，看清楚你想要什么是非常重要的，因为基于内识的关系将是持久的。它们的影响将永远伴随着你，甚至超越这一生。这就是这些关系的永久性。你需要发展的辨别力将使你真正感受到它们与其他一切的对比。</p>
<p>Your purpose in life is waiting to be discovered once you have reached a state of maturity. One of the qualities of maturity is that you begin to value things that last. You want to invest in things that have promise not only for the present but for the future as well. You look for things that are more substantial, and you look for different qualities in people. In relationships, you look for compatibility now, not beauty, excitement, romance or infatuation. You look for compatibility, honesty, productivity, and so forth. These are different criteria. Unfortunately, these things are not highly valued in this world. Here in your world, romance is the ultimate expression of union—self abandonment in a profound love state where you forget all problems, past, present and future, in order to have a glorious moment with another person. For this moment, you will sacrifice a great deal and will expend your resources to a great extent.</p>
<p>一旦你达到成熟的状态，你的生命目的就等待着你去发现。成熟的特质之一是你开始重视持久的关系。你想投资于那些不仅对现在而且对未来都有希望的关系。你寻找更有价值的关系，你在人身上寻找不同的品质。在关系中，你现在寻找的是兼容性，而不是美丽、兴奋、浪漫或迷恋。你寻找的是兼容性、诚实、生产力，等等。这些都是不同的标准。不幸的是，这些关系在这个世界上没有得到高度重视。在你们的世界里，浪漫是结合的最终表现——在深刻的爱的状态下自我放弃，在那里你忘记了所有的问题，过去、现在和未来，以便与另一个人有一个光辉的时刻。为了这个时刻，你会做出很大的牺牲，并在很大程度上消耗你的资源。</p>
<p>When you reach maturity, you are not going for things that are momentary. You want things that last. You want to build something. You are thinking not only of immediate satisfaction. You are thinking of future providership. You are thinking of yourself in terms of making a contribution, not only for the present time but in times to come. Here your life becomes much bigger. You are living in a bigger world. You are seeing yourself participating in a larger time frame. This represents maturity. Out of this state comes a desire for achievement that is markedly different from your former state.</p>
<p>当你达到成熟的时候，你不会去追求那些一时的关系。你想要持久的关系。你想建立一些关系。你想的不仅仅是眼前的满足。你考虑的是未来的供应。你在考虑自己的贡献，不仅是为现在，而且是为未来的时代。在这里，你的生命变得更大了。你正生活在一个更大的世界里。你看到自己参与到一个更大的时间框架中。这代表着成熟。从这种状态中产生了一种对成就的渴望，这与你以前的状态明显不同。</p>
<p>At times we have been very hard on adolescent mentality, which is quite rampant here. It would be fun to have this mentality, if it were not so tragic. It is actually very silly, and it is unfortunate that so many resources are being spent for it when it provides so little.</p>
<p>有时我们对青春期的心态非常严厉，这种心态在这里相当猖獗。如果这种心态不是那么悲惨的话，那就很有趣了。它实际上是非常愚蠢的，而且不幸的是，在它提供的东西很少的情况下，却为它花费了那么多的资源。</p>
<p>As I have said, your worldly family initiates you into the world, but your Spiritual Family initiates you into the Mystery. You were born from the Mystery. You will die into the Mystery. Mystery is where you have come from. Everything that is lasting comes from the Mystery. Everything that is transitory comes from the manifestation.</p>
<p>正如我所说的，你的世俗家庭让你进入这个世界，但你的精神家庭让你进入神秘世界。你从神秘中诞生。你将死于神秘之中。神秘是你的来源。一切持久的关系都来自于神秘。一切短暂的关系都来自于显现。</p>
<p>There are two things that last in this world: There are tangible, physical manifestations and there is relationship. Of the two, relationship is far more lasting because it continues long after your death. After all, buildings fall down and societies change, but what you have begun continues to move.</p>
<p>在这个世界上有两样东西是持久的：一是有形的、物质的表现，另一样是关系。在这两者中，关系更加持久，因为它在你死后依然存在。毕竟，建筑会倒塌，社会会变迁，但你所开始的关系会持续发展。</p>
<p>When you begin to experience your Spiritual Family, you enter a whole new realm of relationship. There are many illusions that go along with the idea of spirituality, of course, and many things are hoped for. But when you begin your education with your Spiritual Family—those individuals both within and beyond the world who are working on your spiritual development directly—it will require that illusions be seen as such and be discerned from those things that are really true.</p>
<p>当你开始经历你的精神家庭时，你进入了一个全新的关系领域。当然，有许多幻想伴随着精神的想法，人们对许多幻想抱有希望。但是当你开始与你的精神家庭——那些在世界范围内和世界范围外直接为你的精神发展工作的个体——这将要求你将幻想视为幻想，并将其与那些真正的事实加以辨别。</p>
<p>There is kind of a romance about spirituality, too, and it is all right because it is predictable. Without direct experience, what can you have but assumptions? So, the sooner you can have the direct experience the better because assumptions become cherished, particularly if they have become the foundation of your identity. Then, even if they are not true, you will not want to admit it for fear that your life will be wasted. If an idea lasts too long and if an identity is built upon it, it will be very hard to relinquish that idea. That is why ideas need to stay in motion and not become solid. Your true identity is beyond all ideas. Ideas can either help or hinder you in your progress. They are temporary expedients.</p>
<p>关于精神，也有一种浪漫，它是正确的，因为它是可预测的。没有直接经历，除了假设，你还能有什么？所以，你越早有直接经历越好，因为假设会被珍惜，特别是如果它们已经成为你身份的基础。那么，即使它们不是真的，你也不会愿意承认，因为担心你的生命会被浪费掉。如果一个想法持续的时间太长，如果一个身份是建立在它之上的，那么要放弃这个想法将是非常困难的。这就是为什么想法需要保持在运动中，而不是成为固体。你的真实身份是超越所有想法的。想法可以帮助或阻碍你的进步。它们是暂时的权宜之计。</p>
<p>Now, the question of relationship is not really that complex. Everyone wants everything right away, but things that are important do not come immediately. They must come at the right time, and you must prepare for them. There are not many people who are prepared for successful marriage. That’s why there is so much divorce. It’s not hard to get married—not really—if you really want it. Just talk someone into loving you, find out what they want, try to be that, and for a period of time they will be convinced. Perhaps.</p>
<p>现在，关于关系的问题并不是那么复杂。每个人都希望立刻得到一切，但重要的事情并不会立即发生。它们必须在适当的时机出现，你必须为之做好准备。没有多少人为成功的婚姻做好了准备。这就是为什么有那么多离婚的原因。结婚并不难，如果你真的想要的话。只要说服某人爱上你，了解他们想要什么，尽力做到那样，一段时间他们会被说服。也许吧。</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a great deal of experimentation in relationships. This is necessary to a point, but again we are aiming for something substantial and lasting. When you begin to realize your true powers of discernment, it will become increasingly difficult to make mistakes in relationships. Ultimately, it will become very hard to make any mistake. At the beginning you have this resource to fall back on. We call it Knowledge and this is what we teach.</p>
<p>因此，在关系中存在着大量的试验。这在一定程度上是必要的，但我们的目标还是要有实质性的、持久的关系。当你开始意识到你真实的辨别能力时，在人际关系中犯错误将变得越来越困难。最终，要犯任何错误都会变得非常困难。在开始时，你有这个资源可以依靠。我们称它为内识，这就是我们所教的。</p>
<p>To reach a greater achievement, the whole question of relationship must be re-examined. If you want something lasting, it requires different criteria. It may seem great to fall in love, but it often does not lead anywhere, and it carries with it a very great price. Likewise, it may seem fun to have a party and make love and all that, but it all carries a price. As you get a little older, you begin to realize the price—what it has cost you to invest yourself so greatly in little things. Therefore, if you feel you have reached a place where you want something truly substantial and lasting, it will require a different set of criteria for relationships. This requires patience.</p>
<p>为了达到更大的成就，必须重新审视整个关系的问题。如果你想要持久的关系，就需要不同的标准。坠入爱河似乎很好，但它往往不会有任何结果，而且它带有非常大的代价。同样地，开派对和做爱等似乎很有趣，但这一切都有代价。随着你年龄的增长，你开始意识到代价——你在小事上如此大的投资所付出的代价。因此，如果你觉得你已经达到了一个地方，你想要真正实质性和持久的关系，这将需要一套不同的关系标准。这需要耐心。</p>
<p>There are only two things in life: There is relationship and there is ideas. As you abandon ideas, you become more available for relationship. So, don’t look for new ideas because you will have to abandon those too. When I say relationship, people always think of romance because at this level that is what most relationship seems to be. Romance is a very small part of life. Romance is simply enjoyment between people who are united. When did it become the sole object of life where people will spend all their money and all their time preparing themselves for this little romantic dance, which at best offers only a few glorious moments? It is very intoxicating, but not much real love comes out of it.</p>
<p>生活中只有两件事。一种是关系，另一种是想法。当你放弃想法时，你就会变得更有机会建立关系。因此，不要寻找新的想法，因为你也将不得不放弃这些想法。当我说到关系时，人们总是想到浪漫，因为在这个层面上，大多数关系似乎都是这样。浪漫是生活的一个非常小的部分。浪漫只是团结在一起的人之间的享受。什么时候它变成了生活的唯一目标，人们会花所有的钱和所有的时间为这支小小的浪漫之舞做准备，而这支舞最多只能提供几个光辉的时刻？它是非常令人陶醉的，但没有多少真正的爱从里面出来。</p>
<p>When I say relationship, people think, “Oh, boy meets girl. How wonderful!” I am not talking about that. I am talking about relationship in a bigger way, where you are really united with someone beyond your personal interests. As you let yourself follow what is being given to you, it will make you ever more reliant upon and ever more sensitive to the presence of your Spiritual Family. After all, to become truly united with someone, you must rely on them. This is hard to achieve in a society that places such a premium on individual self-reliance, where you try to be powerful and try not to need anyone. A true island! A fortress!</p>
<p>当我说到关系时，人们会想，”哦，男孩遇到女孩。多么美妙！”我不是在说这个。我说的是更大的关系，在那里你与某人真正团结在一起，超越你的个人利益。当你让自己追随给你的关系时，它将使你更加依赖你的精神家庭的存在，并对其更加敏感。毕竟，要与某人真正结合，你必须依赖他们。在一个如此重视个人自力更生的社会中，这是很难实现的，在那里你试图成为强大的人，并试图不需要任何人。一个真正的孤岛！一个堡垒！</p>
<p>This is not the way to undo pathetic needs. Great relationships are established because individuals can rely upon each other. This is not simply because they have seen each other and have felt a deep affinity. Affinity is not yet relationship. Emotional attraction is not yet relationship. It is only potential for relationship.</p>
<p>这不是消除可悲需求的方法。伟大的关系的建立是因为个人可以相互依赖。这不是简单地因为他们已经看到了对方，并且已经感到了深深的亲和力。亲和力还不是关系。情感上的吸引还不是关系。它只是关系的潜力。</p>
<p>When people do something in life together, it establishes relationship. When they carry weight together and when they rely upon each other, it establishes relationship. That is why we are interested in people doing things together, not simply being mesmerized by their recognition of one another. Recognition is important, but it is not the substance and foundation of relationship. You can experience great recognition with individuals that you will not be able to do anything with. You may experience a tremendous feeling of affinity with another, but in life you can do very little together. How often have people married because of an experience of affinity, only to find out that in real life they could do very little together? How often this has occurred.</p>
<p>当人们在生活中一起做一些事情时，就会建立起关系。当他们一起负重，当他们互相依赖，就建立了关系。这就是为什么我们对人们一起做事感兴趣，而不是简单地被他们对彼此的认可所吸引。认可很重要，但它不是关系的实质和基础。你可以经历到对个人的极大认可，但你却无法与之做任何事情。你可能会经历到与另一个人的巨大亲和感，但在生活中你们在一起能做的事情很少。有多少人因为亲和力的经历而结婚，但却发现在现实生活中他们在一起能做的事情很少？这种情况经常发生。</p>
<p>You cannot carry on substantial physical achievement and spiritual achievement simultaneously because they both require too much time. It is possible that someone who has achieved something that is very substantial in the physical world will have a real spiritual emergence. But you cannot succeed in the two realms simultaneously, though many people are currently trying. They are trying very hard to be magnificent in all aspects and do you know what? They don’t make much progress in any aspect. You see, you cannot trick the way things are and find a new way to slip through a loophole in life. Look back in history. You are not smarter than people used to be.</p>
<p>你不能同时进行实质性的物质成就和精神成就，因为它们都需要太多的时间。有可能有人在物质世界中取得了非常可观的成就，会有真正的精神出现。但你不可能同时在这两个领域取得成功，尽管目前很多人正在努力。他们非常努力地想在各方面都很宏伟，你知道吗？他们在任何方面都没有取得太大的进展。你看，你不能欺骗事物的方式，找到一个新的方法，从生命的漏洞中溜走。回顾一下历史。你并不比过去的人聪明。</p>
<p>If you really want to find out the Mystery of your life, if that is the direction you choose, then that will draw all of your primary energy. If you wish to be involved in manifest life, then that will draw all of your energy. People who want it all don’t go very far because you must make choices along the way. You must let go of that to have this or let go of this to have that. Why is this true? Because your Spiritual Family is extremely powerful and the attraction to your Spiritual Family is stronger than the world itself. Your attempt to maintain a precarious balance cannot last in the face of real forces. Likewise, the world is a real force and will captivate you completely, leaving little time or energy for other things.</p>
<p>如果你真的想找出你生命的奥秘，如果这是你选择的方向，那么这将吸引你所有的主要能量。如果你希望参与显现生命，那么这将吸引你所有的能量。想得到一切的人不会走得很远，因为你必须在这一路上做出选择。你必须放下那个才能拥有这个，或者放下这个才能拥有那个。为什么这是真的呢？因为你的精神家庭是非常强大的，对你的精神家庭的吸引力比世界本身还要强大。在真正的力量面前，你试图维持一种不稳定的平衡是无法持久的。同样，世界也是一种真实的力量，会完全吸引你，几乎没有时间或精力去做其他事情。</p>
<p>Do not think that your barriers can keep you from Knowledge. But your desire for Knowledge must be greater than your barriers. If desire is weak, barriers are great. If desire is strong, barriers are few. Therefore, we don’t look at barriers with a magnifying glass. We rekindle the desire for truth and Knowledge because these things give meaning everywhere and provide all good things in this world.</p>
<p>不要以为你的障碍可以使你远离内识。但你对内识的渴望必须大于你的障碍。如果渴望很弱，障碍就会很大。如果渴望很强，障碍就很小。因此，我们不要用放大镜去看障碍。我们重新点燃对真理和内识的渴望，因为真理与内识在任何地方都赋予意义，并提供这个世界上所有的美好事物。</p>
