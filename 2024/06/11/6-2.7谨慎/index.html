<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on March 23, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年3月23日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does discretion mean? It means the ability to know when to speak and when not to speak. Can you recall a time when you said something and then regretted saying it? Can you recall a time when you said something to someone and then realized that it was the wrong thing to say? Perhaps it was wrong for them, or perhaps it revealed too much about you. Can you recall a time when you revealed something to another, but it was not appropriate? Or perhaps it was a time when you said something and it fell into the wrong hands or was misinterpreted, and it came back to haunt you later?</p>
<p>谨慎是什么意思？它意味着有能力知道什么时候说话，什么时候不说话。你能想起什么时候你说了什么，然后又后悔说了什么吗？你能回忆起你对某人说了什么，然后意识到说错话的时候吗？也许是对他们来说是错误的，或者是它暴露了你太多的信息。你能回忆起你曾向另一个人透露过什么，但它是不恰当的吗？或者，也许有一次你说了一些话，但落入了错误的人手中，或者被误解了，后来又困扰着你？</p>
<p>If you think about these things, you will see that they present a great problem in communication. Generally, there are three different stages of development in communication. The first stage is the inability to express yourself. The second stage is when you feel you have to express yourself. And the third stage is when you do not need to express yourself except on rare occasions to certain people. These three stages represent the three stages of development in a human being: the stages of dependence, independence and interdependence.</p>
<p>如果你想一想这些事情，你会发现它们在沟通中带来了很大的问题。一般来说，沟通中存在三个不同的发展阶段。第一个阶段是无法表达自己。第二阶段是你觉得你必须要表达自己。而第三个阶段是你不需要表达自己，除非在极少数情况下对某些人表达。这三个阶段代表了人类发展的三个阶段：依赖、独立和相互依赖的阶段。</p>
<p>In the first stage, you are barely aware of what your own experience is, and you have great difficulty in expressing this to another. Either you do not have the skills to express this or you do not have the awareness of what you need to express, and you are so fearful that you cannot bridge the gap and pull it out of yourself. This first stage, then, is one of self-repression. It is not a stage where discernment and discretion are exercised much at all.</p>
<p>在第一个阶段，你几乎不知道自己的经历是什么，你很难向他人表达。要么你没有表达的技巧，要么你没有意识到你需要表达的东西，你非常害怕，以至于你无法弥合这个差距，无法把它从自己身上拉出来。那么，这个第一阶段是自我压抑的阶段。在这个阶段，你根本就没有行使辨别力和谨慎。</p>
<p>In the second stage, you are experiencing some freedom, which means you are experiencing your own ideas and are able to think more freely and independently. It is during this stage that you feel almost compelled to express yourself. You want to exercise your freedom. You do not want to restrain yourself, for you are trying to escape all of the self-restraint that had bound you previously.</p>
<p>在第二阶段，你正在经历一些自由，这意味着你正在经历自己的想法，能够更加自由和独立地思考。正是在这个阶段，你几乎感到不得不表达自己。你想行使你的自由。你不想约束自己，因为你正试图摆脱之前束缚你的所有自我约束。</p>
<p>Then we enter the third stage, which is a stage where you interact with others in a very responsible way. Here discretion becomes very important because you realize that everything you say has an impact on others, and in everything you say you declare yourself in a very permanent way. Certainly, anyone who has a position of responsibility or leadership realizes that everything they say will be taken to heart by someone. They must be much more judicious in what they say and in what they want to emphasize. Here communication carries with it great responsibility, not just responsibility to yourself and your desire to express yourself, but responsibility for what happens as a result of your self-expression.</p>
<p>然后我们进入第三个阶段，这是一个你以非常负责任的方式与他人互动的阶段。在这里，谨慎变得非常重要，因为你意识到你说的每一句话都会对他人产生影响，在你说的每一句话中，你都以一种非常持久的方式宣告自己。当然，任何有责任或领导地位的人都意识到，他们所说的一切都会被某人记在心里。他们必须对自己所说的话和想强调的事情更加谨慎。在这里，沟通带着巨大的责任，不仅仅是对自己和你表达自己的愿望负责，而是对你自我表达的结果负责。</p>
<p>Therefore, we have dependence, independence and interdependence—the three great stages of human development. Most people are in the first two stages. Actually, most people are in the first stage; many are working their way into the second stage, and very few have reached the third stage at all. In the first stage, people cannot speak. In the second stage, they must speak as an expression of their freedom and independence. In the third stage, they speak rarely to certain people for certain purposes, for they realize here the great responsibility that goes with self-expression. If you think about this, you will realize that within these three stages you are developing a thorough understanding of your own experience, and you are learning Wisdom and how it can be expressed most effectively in the world.</p>
<p>因此，我们有依赖性、独立性和相互依赖性——人类发展的三个巨大阶段。大多数人处于前两个阶段。事实上，大多数人处于第一阶段；许多人正在努力进入第二阶段，很少有人达到第三阶段。在第一个阶段，人们不能说话。在第二阶段，他们必须说话，以表达他们的自由和独立。在第三阶段，他们很少为了某些目的而对某些人说话，因为他们在这里意识到自我表达所带来的巨大责任。如果你想一想，你会意识到在这三个阶段中，你正在发展对自己经历的透彻理解，你正在学习智慧以及如何在世界中最有效地表达它。</p>
<p>In the first stage of dependence, you cannot express yourself because you are not aware of your own experience sufficiently and you do not have the skills or courage yet to break the bonds that hold you. In the second stage of independence, you are breaking the bonds, and your desire to communicate is more a desire to release energy and to unburden yourself than it is to effectively change or impact others. Here self-expression becomes very chaotic. You do not yet realize the consequences of what you say. You are enjoying the freedom of saying it instead.</p>
<p>在第一个依赖阶段，你无法表达自己，因为你没有充分意识到自己的经历，你还没有技能或勇气打破束缚你的束缚。在独立的第二阶段，你正在打破束缚，你的交流欲望更多的是释放能量和解除自己的负担，而不是有效地改变或影响他人。在这里，自我表达变得非常混乱。你还没有意识到你所说的话的后果。你反而在享受说出来的自由。</p>
<p>The third stage of interdependence, where you begin to interact in relationships from a position of responsibility and self-awareness, is the stage where your discretion becomes ever more important because without it you produce unwanted and often disastrous results, for yourself and other people. Here you must learn restraint. And here you must learn discernment in order to determine when and where you must express yourself. Restraint is important here because you must often withhold what you want to say. People who are involved in the second stage of independence often cannot tolerate withholding anything. They think withholding anything is a violation of their nature and their freedom. They think they have a right to express anything to anyone. Well, they will eventually find out that this produces unwanted results and conflict. It produces great trouble in the world. So if they are smart, they will begin to realize that they have to be more careful who they communicate to and what they say.</p>
<p>第三阶段是相互依存，你开始从一个负责任和自我意识的位置在关系中互动，在这个阶段，你的谨慎变得越来越重要，因为如果没有谨慎，你就会产生不想要的、往往是灾难性的结果，对你自己和其他人都是如此。在这里你必须学会克制。在这里，你必须学会辨别，以确定何时何地你必须表达自己。克制在这里很重要，因为你必须经常扣留你想说的话。处于独立第二阶段的人往往不能容忍扣留任何话语。他们认为扣留任何话语都是对他们本性和自由的侵犯。他们认为自己有权利向任何人表达任何事情。那么，他们最终会发现，这产生了不想要的结果和冲突。它在这个世界上产生了巨大的麻烦。因此，如果他们是聪明人，他们会开始意识到，他们必须更小心地与谁沟通，说什么。</p>
<p>Those individuals who have become wise have had to realize that they have to be careful of what they say to anyone, anywhere, at any time. They are careful because they realize that all self-expression affects relationships and generates a response in others. They want to cultivate genuine relationships, and they want to nurture a genuine response. They do not want the tribulation that goes with irresponsible self-expression. To the wise, then, this restraint is not seen as self-repression. They are able to fully express themselves. They are able to express their feelings, their anger, their sadness, their joy, their inspiration, their disappointment, and so forth. They have developed this skill. Now they know they must use it wisely.</p>
<p>那些已经变得明智的人不得不意识到，他们必须小心他们对任何人、任何地方、任何时间所说的话。他们很小心，因为他们意识到所有的自我表达都会影响到关系，并在他人身上产生反应。他们想培养真正的关系，他们想培养真正的回应。他们不希望不负责任的自我表达所带来的磨难。那么，对智者来说，这种克制并不被看作是自我压抑。他们能够充分表达自己。他们能够表达他们的感受，他们的愤怒，他们的悲伤，他们的快乐，他们的灵感，他们的失望，等等。他们已经发展了这种技能。现在他们知道他们必须明智地使用它。</p>
<p>People in the first stage of dependence cannot express their feelings effectively, for they cannot experience them fully. People in the second stage of independence are beginning to experience their own range of emotions and their own ideas, and their desire to express these is great. However, this desire is not yet born of Wisdom. The wise person must exercise discretion at all times. Here there will be feelings of loneliness and exclusion because the wise cannot express the depth of their experience effectively to many people. They must hold their experience within themselves and let it grow there. This generates focus and energy, which is power. It also develops respect for other people’s experience and position in life and respect for one’s own experience and position as well.</p>
<p>处于依赖性第一阶段的人不能有效地表达他们的感受，因为他们不能充分地经历这些感受。处于独立第二阶段的人开始经历自己的情感范围和自己的想法，他们表达这些的渴望是很大的。然而，这种渴望还不是由智慧产生的。智慧的人必须在任何时候都谨慎行事。这里会有孤独和排斥的感觉，因为智者无法向许多人有效地表达他们的经验深度。他们必须将自己的经验保存在自己体内，让它在那里成长。这产生了焦点和能量，这就是力量。它还能发展对其他人的经历和生命位置的尊重，以及对自己的经历和位置的尊重。</p>
<p>Responsibility must accompany power in order for power to be used wisely and to have a beneficial effect. How true this is in self-expression. Here Knowledge is your guide, for Knowledge will move you to speak to certain people and will remain silent with everyone else. As you progress towards Knowledge, and as you cultivate your relationship with Knowledge and learn to receive Knowledge, you too will express potent things to certain people and will be silent with everyone else. This will be done without judgment or condemnation. You will not judge one person as worthy and another as unworthy. It has nothing to do with that. It is just that you are called to express certain things to certain people whom you sense can understand and receive your self-expression in a constructive and beneficial way. With everyone else, you hold that self-expression within yourself and let its potency grow.</p>
<p>责任感必须伴随着力量，才能使力量得到明智的使用并产生有益的效果。这在自我表达中是多么真实。在这里，内识是你的向导，因为内识会让你对某些人说话，对其他人则保持沉默。随着你对内识的进步，随着你培养与内识的关系并学会接受内识，你也会对某些人表达有力的东西，对其他人则保持沉默。这将是在没有判断或谴责的情况下进行的。你不会判断一个人是值得的，另一个人是不值得的。这与此没有关系。只是你被要求向某些人表达某些东西，你觉得他们能理解并以建设性和有益的方式接受你的自我表达。对于其他人，你要在自己体内保持自我表达，并让它的效力增长。</p>
<p>It is interesting that people in the second stage of development, independence, who feel so powerful as they begin to spread their own wings to some degree, dissipate their power and focus all the time through irresponsible self-expression. For them, self-expression is more about unburdening themselves, getting their experience out of their system. They do not want to hold it. They think holding back is a form of self-repression. Because they are trying to escape from dependency, they are afraid of withholding anything and tend to feel very affronted when they have to. This is an adolescent stage of development. Adolescence is highlighted by new expressions and experiences of power, but without the Wisdom and responsibility to carry power or use it wisely.</p>
<p>有趣的是，处于发展第二阶段的人，即独立的人，当他们开始在某种程度上展开自己的翅膀时，感到非常强大，但他们的力量和注意力总是通过不负责任的自我表达而消散。对他们来说，自我表达更多的是为了解除自己的负担，把自己的经验从身体中释放出来。他们不想保留它。他们认为憋着是一种自我压抑。因为他们试图摆脱依赖，所以他们害怕扣留任何东西，当他们不得不扣留时，往往会感到非常被冒犯。这是一个青春期的发展阶段。青春期的特点是对力量的新表达和经历，但没有智慧和责任来承载力量或明智地使用它。</p>
<p>The second stage of development is like immature adulthood. Many people are trying to get into the second stage because you must go through it. Many people even teach it. They are very critical of anything that denies a person’s right to self-expression or a person’s right to have, to do and to be whatever they want. People teach this because they are trying to learn it, but they have not yet realized that there is a vast stage beyond this. In fact, the third stage, the stage of interdependence, is so much greater than the first two that there is no comparison between them. You will never graduate from the third stage of development, for there is so much growth and progress to be made here.</p>
<p>发展的第二阶段就像不成熟的成年期。许多人都想进入第二阶段，因为你必须经历这个阶段。许多人甚至教导人们要经历第二阶段。他们对任何剥夺一个人自我表达的权利或一个人拥有、做和成为自己想要的任何东西的权利的行为都持非常批判的态度。人们教这些，是因为他们正在努力学习，但他们还没有意识到，在这之外还有一个广阔的阶段。事实上，第三个阶段，即相互依存阶段，要比前两个阶段大得多，它们之间没有可比性。你将永远不会从第三个发展阶段毕业，因为这里有太多的成长和进步。</p>
<p>Many people want power and all that they associate with power, but few want the responsibility that must go with it. Responsibility requires discernment, discretion and restraint. Can people who are relishing their independence exercise this restraint without seeing it as a form of self-repression? They can only if they realize that their power carries a responsibility and that if they do not want to create chaos around them, they must use their abilities more carefully and more judiciously. This prepares them to have discretion.</p>
<p>许多人想要力量和所有与力量相关的东西，但很少有人想要必须与之相关的责任。责任需要辨别力、谨慎和克制。那些喜欢独立的人能够行使这种克制而不把它看作是一种自我压抑的形式吗？只有当他们意识到他们的力量带有责任，如果他们不想在周围制造混乱，他们就必须更谨慎、更明智地使用他们的能力。这使他们准备好拥有谨慎。</p>
<p>Now, many people think discretion is simply keeping your mouth shut. “Don’t say it. Don’t say that thing. Hold it back. Don’t say anything to anybody. You are safer when you keep your mouth shut.” That is how people think of discretion, but this is not discretion. Discretion is knowing when to speak and when not to speak and being able to follow this faithfully. That is discretion. It requires that you have power, ability and a high level of self-acceptance. If you have a contentious relationship with yourself, then you will not be able to approach anything with Wisdom. The man and woman of Knowledge can withhold their self-expression without any sense of self-violation, and they can take the risk of telling someone something important, perhaps something that is deemed risky, without any sense of self-violation. Indeed, the only real self-violation comes when you are going against Knowledge. Yet, you must have a sufficient experience of Knowledge to know when you are going towards it and when you are going away from it.</p>
<p>现在，许多人认为谨慎只是闭口不谈。”不要说了。不要说那件事。忍住不说。不要对任何人说什么。当你闭上你的嘴时，你会更安全。”这就是人们对谨慎的看法，但这不是谨慎。谨慎是知道什么时候说话，什么时候不说话，并且能够忠实地遵循这一点。这就是谨慎。它要求你有力量、能力和高度的自我接纳。如果你与自己有争执的关系，那么你将无法用智慧来处理任何事情。拥有内识的男人和女人可以扣留他们的自我表达，而没有任何自我侵犯的感觉，他们可以冒着风险告诉别人一些重要的事情，也许是被认为有风险的事情，而没有任何自我侵犯的感觉。事实上，唯一真正的自暴自弃是在你违背内识的时候。然而，你必须对内识有足够的经历，才能知道你何时走向它，何时远离它。</p>
<p>Discretion, then, is the ability to speak and to not speak. Now, many people cannot express themselves, while others talk incessantly, saying everything to whomever will listen and to whomever they feel comfortable with. This represents two early stages of development, but neither represents a stage of maturity. Neither of these approaches is effective in nurturing genuine relationship or in accomplishing things harmoniously in the world. So, you may ask, “How do I know when to speak and when not to speak?” You will know because Knowledge will motivate you. If you want to say something to someone and you feel restraint, don’t say it. If the feeling of restraint is deep within you, do not say anything. However, if the restraint is at the surface of your mind and deep within you, you know you must communicate something, then you have to take the risk and find the words, without apology.</p>
<p>那么，谨慎就是说话和不说话的能力。现在，许多人无法表达自己，而另一些人则滔滔不绝，对任何愿意听的人和他们觉得舒服的人说一切。这代表了两个早期的发展阶段，但都不代表成熟的阶段。这两种方法都不能有效地培养真正的关系或在世界范围内和谐地完成事情。因此，你可能会问，”我怎么知道什么时候说话，什么时候不说话？”你会知道，因为内识会激励你。如果你想对某人说些什么，而你感到克制，就不要说。如果克制的感觉在你内心深处，就不要说。但是，如果克制感在你的心灵表面和内心深处，你知道你必须传达一些东西，那么你就必须冒着风险，找到话语，而无需道歉。</p>
<p>How can you discern what is deep within you and what is at the surface? Without Knowledge you cannot do this. You can think any impulse is true or any impulse is to be feared. To become a student of Knowledge is to cultivate your relationship with Knowledge, which is your most primary relationship. This will teach you the real meaning of discretion, for you will find that Knowledge only speaks at certain times. It is waiting for the moments of readiness, when the conditions are right, the audience is right and the need is there.</p>
<p>你怎么能辨别什么是在你内心深处，什么是在表面？没有内识，你无法做到这一点。你可以认为任何冲动都是真实的，或者任何冲动都是值得恐惧的。成为内识的学生就是培养你与内识的关系，这是你最主要的关系。这将教会你谨慎的真正含义，因为你会发现，内识只在某些时候说话。它在等待准备就绪的时刻，当条件合适，听众合适，需求也在那里。</p>
<p>When people begin to study The Greater Community Way of Knowledge and to follow its practices according to the Ancient Tradition that is being given here, they are always asking Knowledge incessant questions: “Tell me my purpose. Tell me what I should do. Should I take this job or should I take that job? Should I go with this person or should I not go with this person? Should I open up or should I close down? How can I have peace? How can I have equanimity? How can I get out of this situation? How can I get into that situation?” There is this incessant questioning, and what do they experience receiving ninety percent of the time? They experience silence, or they just hear their own mind—their own preferences and their own confusion. They hear yes and no, do this or don’t do that—they hear all of these things. Yet, this is all at the surface of the mind. Down deep there is stillness.</p>
<p>当人们开始学习大社区内识之路，并根据这里提供的古老传统遵循其做法时，他们总是不停地问内识。”告诉我我的目的。告诉我我应该做什么。我应该做这个工作还是做那个工作？我应该跟这个人走还是不应该跟这个人走？我应该开放还是应该关闭？我怎样才能拥有平静？我怎样才能拥有平和的心态？我怎样才能摆脱这种情况？我怎样才能进入那个环境？”有这种不间断的提问，而他们在百分之九十的时间里经历到的是什么？他们经历到沉默，或者他们只是听到自己的心声——自己的喜好和自己的困惑。他们听到”是”和”不是”，做这个或不做那个——他们听到所有这些事情。然而，这都是在心灵的表面。在深处，有静止。</p>
<p>This points to Knowledge. Knowledge is fulfilled within itself, so it is able to restrain itself for a very long time. Indeed, there may be a very long time between the experience of knowing and the expression of knowing. Usually this is the case. You may know something, and yet it may take years for it to come about. You may know something about another, and yet it may take years for you to express it to them effectively, if you ever do. Is this self-repression? No. This is Knowledge.</p>
<p>这指的是内识。内识在其内部得到了满足，所以它能够在很长的时间内克制自己。事实上，在内识的经历和内识的表达之间可能有很长的时间。通常情况下是这样的。你可能知道一些事情，但可能要花很多年才能实现。你可能知道一些关于另一个人的事情，但你可能要花很多年才能有效地向他们表达，如果你曾经这样做的话。这是自我压抑吗？不，这就是内识。</p>
<p>Your relationship with Knowledge must be developed in order to function at this level. For the vast majority of people who are struggling with dependencies, this is not meaningful. They are not experiencing discretion to any great degree. They are experiencing self-repression. They cannot speak. They often do not know what they have to say, and if they do, often they cannot say it. Why? Because it would threaten their dependencies. If you begin to make claims of independence and to assert yourself, you begin to threaten your dependencies. If you are not ready to do that, then you will not do it. If you are ready to that, then you will begin to enter the second stage of development, which is independence, where you will begin to enjoy its freedoms and to experience its liabilities.</p>
<p>你与内识的关系必须得到发展，以便在这个层面上发挥作用。对于绝大多数在依赖中挣扎的人来说，这是没有意义的。他们没有在很大程度上经历到谨慎。他们正经历着自我压抑。他们不能说话。他们往往不知道自己要说什么，如果他们知道，也往往说不出来。为什么？因为这将威胁到他们的依赖性。如果你开始提出独立的要求，坚持自己的观点，你就开始威胁到你的依赖性。如果你没有准备好这样做，那么你就不会这样做。如果你准备好了，那么你将开始进入发展的第二个阶段，也就是独立，在那里你将开始享受它的自由并经历它的责任。</p>
<p>I am giving you the idea of discretion in a larger context here. It is tied to learning everything else in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. To be able to speak when it is appropriate and to not speak when it is not appropriate requires a greater development—a greater understanding of yourself, your nature, the dynamics of your relationships and a strong allegiance to your own inner life. All this represents the larger realm of your development.</p>
<p>我在这里给你的是在更大范围内的谨慎的想法。它与学习大社区内识之路中的其他一切内容息息相关。能够在适当的时候说话，在不适当的时候不说话，需要更大的发展——对你自己、你的自我性、你的关系的动态有更多的理解，并对你自己的内在生命有强烈的忠诚。所有这些都代表了你发展的更大领域。</p>
<p>Now you may ask, “How can I develop discretion? I realize that I need to use it.” I say, “Become a student of Knowledge.” If you experience an affinity with Knowledge and with the Greater Community, which represents life beyond this world, then The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is your way. How do you know it is your way? Because you know it. That is the only thing that will keep you with it and enable you to progress. After all, it is not promising you wealth, power, love, comfort, pleasures, glories, divine interventions, angelic contacts, and all this sort of thing. You follow The Greater Community Way of Knowledge because you know you must follow it. This is what carries you forth.</p>
<p>现在你可能会问，”我怎样才能发展谨慎？我意识到我需要使用它”。我说，”成为内识的学生”。如果你经历到与内识和代表超越这个世界的生命的大社区的亲和力，那么大社区的内识之路就是你的方式。你怎么知道它是你的方式？因为你知道它。这是唯一能让你与它保持一致并使你进步的东西。毕竟，它没有承诺给你财富、权力、爱情、舒适、快乐、荣耀、神圣的干预、天使的接触，以及所有这些东西。你遵循大社区内识之路，因为你知道你必须遵循它。这是推动你前进的原因。</p>
<p>All other ambitions and motivations fall away sooner or later. As they fall away, you realize that most conversation is unnecessary. Most of what you think of as your need to express yourself is to merely offset your insecurity. Here you realize that everything you say has value or should have value. Even when you are being light hearted, you want it to be a meaningful experience without trying to create the meaning. Here you become more natural. You become more like the natural world, which is silent and still except when things are happening. The person who is still and silent has great depth and often evokes respect from others, particularly if his or her silence is born of Wisdom.</p>
<p>所有其他的野心和动机迟早都会落空。随着它们的消失，你意识到大多数谈话是不必要的。你所认为的表达自己的需要，大部分只是为了抵消你的不安全感。在这里，你意识到你说的每句话都有价值，或者应该有价值。即使你是轻描淡写，你也希望它是一个有意义的经历，而不试图创造意义。在这里，你变得更加自然。你变得更像自然界，除了事情发生时，自然界是沉默的、静止的。寂静无声的人有很大的深度，往往能唤起他人的尊重，特别是如果他或她的沉默是出于智慧。</p>
<p>Individuals who are engaged in the reclamation of Knowledge are beginning to experience the Mystery of life and are experiencing carrying the Mystery within themselves. The presence of this Mystery affects others, even if nothing is said. The man and woman of Knowledge have a great impact upon others. They are not frittering away their energy with meaningless conversation, analysis or speculation. Because they are holding their communication within themselves, it is growing and becoming more potent. They are not constantly dissipating it by running off to their friends, telling everything that is going on with them and sharing all their deepest experiences in order to get it out of their system. No. The man and woman of Knowledge are holding it in their system so that it can grow in power and become more focused. They want to hold their energy now—to harness it and focus it—rather than expending it as soon as it is experienced.</p>
<p>从事内识开垦的人开始经历生命的神秘，并经历在自己体内携带的神秘。这种神秘的存在会影响他人，即使什么都不说。拥有内识的男人和女人对他人也有很大的影响。他们不会用无意义的谈话、分析或猜测来浪费自己的能量。因为他们在自己的内心深处保持着交流，所以它在成长，变得更有力量。他们不是通过跑去找朋友，告诉他们发生的一切，分享他们最深刻的经历，以便把它从他们的身体中释放出来，从而不断地耗散它。不，内识的男人和女人将它保留在他们的身体中，以便它能够增长力量，变得更加集中。他们现在想保持他们的能量——利用它并集中它——而不是一有经验就把它消耗掉。</p>
<p>People who are wise have experienced the need for discretion and are practicing it effectively. They practice it because they know it is essential. That is their motivation. They are not motivated by fear of reprisal, fear of repercussion or anxiety about the loss of love or money. That is not their motivation. Their motivation is realizing that their self-expression is valuable and must be given to the right people in order for it to be fulfilled. They realize that it is incumbent upon them to learn ways to express themselves effectively, using the right words and often using as few words as possible. For when you have something important to say, the more words you use, the weaker the communication is.</p>
<p>有智慧的人已经经历到了谨慎的需要，并有效地实践了这一点。他们练习它是因为他们知道它是必不可少的。这就是他们的动机。他们的动机不是因为害怕报复，害怕反击，或者对失去爱情或金钱感到焦虑。这不是他们的动机。他们的动机是意识到他们的自我表达是有价值的，必须交给正确的人，才能得到满足。他们意识到，他们有责任学习有效地表达自己的方法，使用正确的词语，并经常使用尽可能少的词语。因为当你有重要的事情要讲时，你用的字越多，沟通就越弱。</p>
<p>Their motivation is that they want success without betraying themselves. In fact, they want to honor themselves. So, they learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, which leads them to say certain things to certain people at the right time, and the rest of the time they maintain stillness and silence, carrying on conversations only to negotiate the necessities of life.</p>
<p>他们的动机是，他们希望在不背叛自己的情况下取得成功。事实上，他们想尊重自己。因此，他们学习大社区内识之路，这使他们在适当的时候对某些人说某些话，其余时间则保持静心和沉默，只进行谈话，以商讨生活的必要性。</p>
<p>Students of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge realize they need to practice stillness all the time. Perhaps stillness seems like self-restraint or self-repression to you, for you keep wanting to get away from all your thoughts—your fantasies, little dramas, speculations, analyses, past recollections and projections into the future. Practice stillness. Stillness is necessary if you are to have discretion. It is necessary if you are to experience discernment. It is necessary if you are to see what is really occurring and to know how to respond. Stillness is necessary if you are to choose the right relationships and proceed in the correct way where there is no self-violation. It is necessary if you wish to speak and act with Wisdom. Stillness is necessary.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路的学生意识到他们需要一直练习静心。也许静止对你来说似乎是自我约束或自我压抑，因为你一直想摆脱你所有的思维——你的幻想、小剧情、猜测、分析、过去的回忆和对未来的预测。练习静心。如果你要有谨慎，静心是必要的。如果你要经历辨别力，它是必要的。如果你要看到真正发生的事情，并知道如何回应，就必须静心。如果你要选择正确的关系，并以正确的方式进行，没有自我侵犯，静心是必要的。如果你想用智慧说话和行动，就必须静心。静心是必要的。</p>
<p>How do you develop real discretion? I will give you some guidelines now. First of all, begin as a student of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge if you have an affinity for the Greater Community. If not, choose another path, another form of development, but always choose a preparation that you did not make up for yourself. Do not take the eclectic approach, choosing a little of this and a little of that, the part of this you like, the part of that you like and add it all together. For you know what you will have? You will have just what you like, and what you like will not take you anywhere. It will just comfort you and affirm you where you are now. Indeed, in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge you learn to transcend your preferences rather than to live by them. The Way of Knowledge takes you beyond preferences to what is known. People who choose the eclectic approach to development only reinforce their preferences and never escape them. Their sense that they are unfree and unfulfilled will continue to haunt them, with little relief in sight.</p>
<p>你如何发展真正的谨慎？我现在将给你一些指导。首先，如果你对大社区有好感，就从大社区内识之路的学生开始。如果没有，就选择另一条道路，另一种发展形式，但一定要选择一个不是你自己编造的准备。不要采取折衷的方法，选择一点这个和一点那个，这个你喜欢的部分，那个你喜欢的部分，然后把它们加在一起。因为你知道你将拥有什么？你将拥有你喜欢的东西，而你喜欢的东西不会把你带到任何地方。它只会安慰你，肯定你现在的位置。事实上，在大社区内识之路中，你学会了超越你的偏好，而不是靠它们生活。内识之路带你超越偏好，去知道已知的偏好。选择折衷主义发展方式的人只会强化他们的偏好，而永远无法摆脱它们。他们对自己不自由和不满足的感觉将继续困扰着他们，几乎看不到任何缓解。</p>
<p>Therefore, choose a preparation not of your own making. Choose something that can take you beyond where you are now into new territory. This is education and this is development. Yes, there is some need for self-reinforcement, but you must still go beyond where you are now. If you choose an eclectic approach, you will not go beyond where you are now. You will only emphasize where you are now. You will invest yourself more in it. That is why it is the great path of going nowhere. If you are to be a real student of The Way, then you must choose a preparation that is correct for you but which is not governed by your preferences and your feelings moment to moment. Then you will practice on days when you feel like it and on days when you don’t feel like it. Then you will be able to entertain ideas when they please you and when they don’t please you. And you will be able to learn skills when they seem to meet your goals and when they don’t seem to meet your goals. This is what it means to be a student—to learn something new, to go where you have not gone before, to entertain ideas that are new, to rethink, to renew, to rejuvenate and to rediscover.</p>
<p>因此，选择一个不属于你自己的准备。选择一些能够超越你现在所处位置的准备，进入新的领域。这就是教育，这就是发展。是的，有一些自我强化的需要，但你仍然必须超越你现在的位置。如果你选择一种折衷的方法，你将不会超越你现在的位置。你只会强调你现在的位置。你会在其中投入更多。这就是为什么这是一条无路可走的大路。如果你想成为一名真正的道的学生，那么你必须选择一个对你来说正确的准备，但它不会被你的喜好和你一时的感觉所支配。然后你将在你喜欢的时候和不喜欢的时候进行练习。然后你将能够在你喜欢的时候和不喜欢的时候接受想法。你将能够在技能似乎符合你的目标和似乎不符合你的目标时学习这些技能。这就是作为一名学生的意义——学习新的东西，去你以前没有去过的地方，接受新的想法，重新思考，更新，恢复活力和重新发现。</p>
<p>If you feel that you are ready to undertake preparation, you should begin to prepare yourself in The Way of Knowledge. This will cultivate all aspects of you and will make true discretion possible. In the interim, I will give you a few guidelines. These are only guidelines, which means that you must learn to use them wisely in different ways and in different situations. They are not rules that never vary and that are the same in all situations. Indeed, the person who is wise is very mutable and can change and apply Wisdom in different situations and in different ways. This represents maturity and advancement.</p>
<p>如果你觉得你已经准备好进行准备，你应该开始在内识之路中准备自己。这将培养你的所有方面，并使真正的谨慎成为可能。在这期间，我将给你一些准则。这些只是准则，这意味着你必须学会以不同的方式和在不同的情况下明智地使用它们。它们不是永远不会变化的规则，在所有情况下都是一样的。事实上，有智慧的人是非常易变的，可以在不同的情况下，以不同的方式改变和应用智慧。这代表着成熟和进步。</p>
<p>The beginning student wants to know the black and white of everything, so when the preparation says, “Do this,” they try to do it in all circumstances without discerning how those circumstances vary or how the application must be different in different circumstances. So, given this propensity in most people, I say, “Say as little as possible.” Communicate to people whom you trust, whom you sense regard you highly and who have a respect for your spiritual life without trying to impose their vantage point upon you. When you do have to say something, say it simply. You do not need to explain everything, to give a myriad of examples and to talk until there is nothing left to say. Let people spend time with what you have said rather than trying to make it totally palatable to them. If you feel the need to express something, but the opportunity is not there or the right people are not there, then hold this within yourself. Let the fires burn hotter within you. It is all right to have this pressure. Hold this energy. It is like sex. Some people think that whenever they feel sexual, they must go out and have sex immediately to relieve themselves. This is madness. Think about this, and you will see that it is madness.</p>
<p>初学者想知道一切的黑与白，所以当准备工作说”这样做”时，他们试图在所有情况下都这样做，而不去辨别这些情况如何变化，或在不同情况下的应用必须不同。因此，鉴于大多数人的这种倾向，我说，”尽可能少说”。与你信任的人沟通，你感觉他们高度重视你，并尊重你的精神生活，但不要试图把他们的观点强加给你。当你不得不说些什么时，要简单地说出来。你不需要解释一切，举出无数的例子，讲到无话可说为止。让人们花点时间了解你所说的，而不是试图让他们完全接受。如果你觉得有必要表达一些事情，但机会不在那里，或者合适的人不在那里，那么就在自己的内心深处坚持下去。让火苗在你体内燃烧得更旺。有这种压力是正常的。保持这种能量。这就像性。有些人认为，每当他们感到有性欲时，他们必须立即出去做爱，以解脱自己。这是很疯狂的。想一想，你会发现这是疯狂的。</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have something you need to say to someone in particular or to everyone or to the universe and the opportunity is not there or the opportunity is not correct or the time is not right, hold it within yourself. Let it grow. This is how you develop depth, potency, insight and self-awareness within yourself. If there is pressure, let the pressure be there. Then, when there is an opportunity to express whatever that is, it will be expressed with tremendous power. Like pulling back the bow, that pressure is what projects the arrow forward into the world. That is what gives your self-expression power. People who talk, talk, talk all the time have no potency in their self-expression. Nothing has built up within them. The arrow just drops on the ground in front of them. It does not go anywhere. But if you let your communication grow within you, it has power, and when it is expressed, there is potency to it.</p>
<p>同样，如果你有一些话需要对某个人或每个人或宇宙说，而机会不在那里，或机会不对，或时机不对，就把它憋在自己心里。让它成长。这就是你如何在自己体内发展深度、效力、洞察力和自我意识。如果有压力，就让压力在那里。然后，当有机会表达任何东西的时候，它就会以巨大的力量表达出来。就像拉开弓一样，这种压力是把箭射向世界的原因。这就是赋予你自我表达的力量。那些一直在说、说、说的人，在他们的自我表达中没有力量。他们的内心没有任何积蓄。箭只是掉在他们面前的地上。它不会去任何地方。但是，如果你让你的交流在你内心成长，它就有力量，当它被表达出来时，就有效力。</p>
<p>So, feel the pressure. Let the fires grow. If you do this wisely, it will develop insight and the ability to restrain yourself, which you must do if you are to become a mature human being. Only adolescents are wild and extravagant, going around having to say anything to anyone whenever the feeling strikes them. And they do not understand why their life is so fraught with conflict and enmity.</p>
<p>所以，感受压力。让火势增长。如果你明智地这样做，会发展出洞察力和克制自己的能力，如果你要成为一个成熟的人，你必须这样做。只有青少年才是狂野的、奢侈的，只要有感觉，就会到处去对任何人说什么。而且他们不明白为什么他们的生命会充满冲突和敌意。</p>
<p>It is true that the Wise remain silent most of the time. Knowledge is like that. When Knowledge releases its arrow, however, it can change a life entirely. It can alter the course of the world. Yet, those who are struggling with dependencies cannot see this. This looks like a darkening and deepening of their dilemma, though it is entirely different. And to those who are enjoying the newfound freedom of independence in the second stage of development, these ideas may seem like they will take them backwards, back to a state of dependency. They don’t want anything curtailing their new freedoms. This is because independence is a very adolescent stage. Adolescents don’t want to be held back or limited by anything. That’s why in adolescence there is very little Wisdom—a great deal of exploration and experimentation and a lot of disasters, disappointments and terrible mistakes, but very little Wisdom.</p>
<p>的确，智者在大多数时候都保持沉默。内识也是如此。然而，当内识释放它的箭时，它可以完全改变一个人的生命。它可以改变世界的进程。然而，那些在依赖中挣扎的人无法看到这一点。这看起来像是他们困境的黑暗和加深，尽管它完全不同。而对于那些在发展的第二阶段正在享受新发现的独立自由的人来说，这些想法可能看起来会让他们倒退，回到依赖的状态。他们不希望有任何事情遏制他们的新自由。这是因为独立是一个非常青春期的阶段。青春期的孩子不希望被任何事情束缚或限制。这就是为什么在青春期很少有智慧——大量的探索和实验，以及大量的灾难、失望和可怕的错误，但很少有智慧。</p>
<p>If you seek Wisdom, then you must exercise discretion, and you must learn the ways of discretion. To learn the ways of discretion, you must learn The Way of Knowledge. That is why instead of learning one skill, you must learn them all. Instead of learning one virtue, you must become virtuous. Instead of learning to acquire one power, you must become powerful. To learn discretion in its true sense is to become a whole and united person, a person who feels the presence of Knowledge within, a presence which is self-generating.</p>
<p>如果你寻求智慧，那么你必须行使谨慎，而且你必须学习谨慎的方法。为了学习谨慎的方法，你必须学习内识之路。这就是为什么不是学习一种技能，而是必须学习所有技能。与其学习一种德行，你必须成为有德行的人。与其学习获得一种力量，你必须变得强大。学习真实意义上的谨慎是成为一个完整的、团结的人，一个能感受到内识在体内存在的人，一个能自我产生的存在。</p>
<p>Here you realize that your life and everything you do is intrinsically expressed through a network of relationships, which you will want to develop slowly with the right people and with the right purpose. You are an individual, but your individuality only has meaning within the context of relationships. It only has meaning in terms of what you can contribute.</p>
<p>在这里你会意识到，你的生命和你所做的一切是通过一个关系网内在地表达出来的，你会希望与正确的人和正确的目的慢慢发展。你是一个个体，但你的个体性只有在关系的背景下才有意义。它只有在你能贡献的方面才有意义。</p>
<p>Here I am describing the third stage of development, the stage of interdependence, where you re-enter relationship as a responsible individual. Here you are able to think for yourself. Here you can account for your own experience and realize that you must re-engage with life in a real and purposeful way in order to have any satisfaction. For indeed, independence, though thrilling and exciting in its newfound freedom, is essentially lonely and isolating. It is inefficient and incapable of producing great results. After all, you can only proclaim your independence for so long. Then you realize you have something to do in life, and you want to do it.</p>
<p>在这里，我描述的是发展的第三个阶段，即相互依存的阶段，在这个阶段，你作为一个负责任的个体重新进入关系。在这里，你能够为自己思考。在这里，你可以说明你自己的经历，并意识到你必须以一种真正的、有目的的方式重新参与生命，以便获得任何满足。因为事实上，独立，虽然在其新发现的自由中令人激动和兴奋，但本质上是孤独和孤立的。它是低效的，无法产生巨大的结果。毕竟，你只能宣称你的独立这么久。然后你意识到你在生命中有事情要做，而且你想去做。</p>
<p>To do something important in life, you must enter into relationship with other people and learn to work with them harmoniously. You must learn to share power. You must learn to restrain yourself. You must learn compromise when compromise is appropriate. You must learn discernment. You must learn all these things, and this prepares you for the third stage of your development, which is the stage of dynamic and genuine interaction with others. Here the need for discretion becomes greater as you realize the importance of your own life and your own self-expression. Here you realize that most conversation is unnecessary and is merely a way to offset insecurity for people. Here silence is preferred because in silence you begin to experience your presence, the presence of others and the meaning of your relationships.</p>
<p>要在生命中做一些重要的事情，你必须与其他人建立关系，并学会与他们和谐地合作。你必须学会分享力量。你必须学会克制自己。你必须学会在适当的时候做出妥协。你必须学会辨别。你必须学习所有这些东西，这为你发展的第三个阶段做好准备，也就是与他人动态和真正互动的阶段。在这里，对谨慎的需求变得更大，因为你意识到你自己的生命和你自己的自我表达的重要性。在这里，你意识到大多数谈话是不必要的，只是为人们抵消不安全感的一种方式。在这里，沉默是首选，因为在沉默中你开始经历你的存在、他人的存在和你的关系的意义。</p>
