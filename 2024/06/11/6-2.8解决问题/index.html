<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on April 4, 1992 in Boulder, CO<br>1992年4月4日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solving problems and learning to engage with Knowledge is a major component of learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge and realizing its total application in your life. So complete is Knowledge and its application that as you progress, you realize that Knowledge is with you at all times. It is just very still and you are very noisy. To experience this Spiritual Presence abiding with you in its stillness begins to give you confidence that if all is quiet with Knowledge, then it is time for you to be quiet too, while you take care of the mundane activities of your life and meet your normal range of responsibilities.</p>
<p>解决问题和学习与内识打交道是学习大社区内识之路和实现其在你生命中的全面应用的主要组成部分。内识和它的应用是如此完整，以至于随着你的进步，你会意识到内识一直与你在一起。它只是非常安静，而你却非常嘈杂。在静心中经历这种精神存在与你同在，开始让你相信，如果内识的一切都很安静，那么现在也是你安静的时候了，同时你要处理生活中的世俗活动，履行你的正常责任范围。</p>
<p>Problems large and small emerge, and here Knowledge plays a very important part. It is confusing to the recipient because Knowledge works very differently from the personal mind. It is quiet a good deal of the time. It must be activated by something beyond itself in order to fully reveal itself. How different this is from the way you think—always pondering, comparing, wondering, creating little scenarios, recalling former ones, working away at certain troublesome issues and reacting negatively against things that are taking your time and energy. Work, work, work. Busy, busy, busy. It is like a meeting that never ends.</p>
<p>大大小小的问题出现了，在这里，内识发挥了非常重要的作用。它让接受者感到困惑，因为内识的工作方式与个人的心智非常不同。它在很多时候都是安静的。它必须被超越自身的问题激活，才能完全显示出自己。这与你的思考方式有多大的不同——总是在思考、比较、猜测、创造小场景、回忆以前的场景、解决某些麻烦的问题，对占用你时间和精力的事情做出消极的反应。工作、劳动、职责。忙碌的，无暇的，熙熙攘攘的。这就像一场永不结束的会议。</p>
<p>Your personal mind always has the engine running. It is only when you go somewhere else while it’s running that you begin to realize that there is something else within you. There is a very different kind of mind there. This is an important discovery, and it will come slowly because to go from living in your personal mind to living in the mind of Knowledge is such a complete and total transition that it will require a completely different perspective and approach to life, a different sense of identity and a different foundation for relationships and activities in the world.</p>
<p>你的个人心智总是有发动机在运转。只有当你在它运转的时候去别的地方，你才开始意识到你内心有别的东西。那里有一个非常不同的心智。这是一个重要的发现，它将慢慢到来，因为从生活在你个人的心智中到生活在内识的心智中是这样一个完全彻底的转变，它将需要一个完全不同的视角和生活方式，一个不同的身份感，一个不同的关系和世界活动的基础。</p>
<p>So, how do you solve problems? To begin with, let’s talk about the kind of problems you are trying to solve. Now, there is the big problem, there are intermediate problems and there are little problems. Occasionally, Knowledge will help you with little problems, but often it won’t, so you must simply work them out. This is usually easier than people realize, but because they often don’t accept that the problem exists or they have some sort of complaint about its appearance, to them a little problem can seem very big. So, instead of simply fixing the situation or discerning how the situation can be improved, there is often confusion with a great deal of upset and lots of conversation with the personal mind charging along, working overtime. This is a big reaction to a little problem.</p>
<p>那么，你是如何解决问题的呢？首先，让我们谈谈你要解决的是什么样的问题。现在，有大问题，有中间问题，也有小问题。偶尔，内识会帮助你解决小问题，但往往不会，所以你必须简单地解决它们。这通常比人们意识到的要容易，但因为他们往往不接受问题的存在，或者对问题的出现有某种抱怨，对他们来说，一个小问题可能看起来非常大。因此，不是简单地解决这个问题，也不是辨别如何改善这个情况，而是经常出现混乱，有大量的不安和大量的谈话，个人的心智在冲锋陷阵，加班工作。这是对一个小问题的大反应。</p>
<p>Here is the problem with problems: little problem, big reaction; big problem, little reaction. This is the problem. This is the big problem. If you lose your car keys, or if your tires are flat, or if you made some kind of mistake or if you neglected something or if you forgot something or if some mechanical thing that you own breaks down, or if somebody else’s mechanical thing breaks down—all these are little problems, but often they incite big reactions. The fact that they incite a big reaction is part of the bigger problem. So, rather than just charging into solving problems, right and left, big and small, let us delineate the problems that Knowledge is working on and the different problems that you are working on.</p>
<p>这就是问题的症结所在：小问题，大反应；大问题，小反应。这就是问题所在。这是大问题。如果你的车钥匙丢了，或者你的轮胎没气了，或者你犯了某种错误，或者你忽视了什么，或者你忘记了什么，或者你自己的一些机械东西坏了，或者别人的机械东西坏了——所有这些都是小问题，但往往它们会引起大反应。它们引起大反应的事实是更大问题的一部分。因此，与其一味地冲锋陷阵，解决左右逢源、大大小小的问题，不如让我们划出内识正在努力解决的问题和你正在努力解决的不同问题。</p>
<p>Trying to make more money, whether it is a necessity or a preference, is always a little problem. Asking “How can I make more money?” might take ninety-eight percent of your energy, but it is still a little problem. Even if the solution requires time and effort, it is a little problem.</p>
<p>试图赚更多的钱，无论它是必需品还是偏好，总是一个小问题。问”我怎样才能赚更多的钱？”可能会花费你百分之九十八的精力，但它仍然是一个小问题。即使解决方案需要时间和精力，它也是一个小问题。</p>
<p>Little problems comprise most of the problems that people are engaged in trying to either solve or avoid. Actually, there are only three possible responses you can have to a problem, big or small. You can avoid it, and there are many avenues for doing that, for human beings are very clever at avoidance. You can complain about it, which means you cannot avoid it, but you are not yet committed to resolving it either, so you complain about it. Or, you can solve it. In the first two, there is a great deal of response to a little problem. There is a great deal of effort extended in avoiding problems and in complaining about them.</p>
<p>小问题构成了人们从事的大部分问题，他们试图解决或避免。实际上，对于一个问题，无论大小，你只能有三种可能的反应。你可以避免它，而且有很多途径可以做到这一点，因为人类在避免方面非常聪明。你可以抱怨它，这意味着你无法避免它，但你也还没有致力于解决它，所以你抱怨它。或者，你可以解决它。在前两种情况下，对一个小问题有大量的反应。在回避问题和抱怨问题时，有大量的努力延伸。</p>
<p>Now, a little problem becomes a bigger problem, or let us say it becomes an intermediate problem, if it is neglected. Then the consequences of avoiding it or not solving it become more troublesome, more difficult and perhaps more expensive. A little problem usually can only become an intermediate problem. A big problem is something else.</p>
<p>现在，一个小问题变成了一个大问题，或者让我们说它变成了一个中间问题，如果它被忽视了。然后，避免它或不解决它的后果会变得更麻烦，更困难，也许更昂贵。一个小问题通常只能成为一个中间问题。一个大问题则是另一回事。</p>
<p>If a problem is neglected for too long, it can become a bigger problem, but in and of itself, it is not a big problem. The bigger problem is that the little problem was not solved, or there was too much energy expended. That is a bigger problem. If a little problem over time becomes a bigger problem, it in itself is not a big problem. It is a problem, but the bigger problem is that it was not recognized in the first place.</p>
<p>如果一个问题被忽视的时间太长，它可能会成为一个更大的问题，但它本身并不是一个大问题。更大的问题是，这个小问题没有得到解决，或者花费了太多的精力。这就是一个更大的问题。如果一个小问题随着时间的推移成为一个更大的问题，它本身并不是一个大问题。它是一个问题，但更大的问题是，它首先没有被认识到。</p>
<p>The big problem is that people do not respond to Knowledge. Knowledge is waving flags, giving indicators, doing everything to warn the person, but the person is not aware or is avoiding something. That is the big problem. The way people respond to life—by not participating with life, by not being in relationship with life, by forging ahead for their own ambitions, trying to live out their own ideas and ideals—this is a big problem, and it gives birth to most little problems as well.</p>
<p>大问题是，人们对内识没有反应。内识在摇旗呐喊，给出指示，做一切事情来警告人们，但人们却没有意识到，或者在回避什么。这就是大问题。人们回应生命的方式——不参与生命，不与生命发生关系，为自己的野心而努力，试图实现自己的想法和理想——这是一个大问题，而且它还产生了大多数小问题。</p>
<p>So, let me talk about problems in general a little more, and then we shall explore solving little problems, intermediate problems and then the big problem. First of all, do not try to not have problems. That is not intelligent. Because you are dealing with the physical world, there are many practical problems to solve. Because you have a personal mind that is disassociated from life, it has lots of problems. Because you are not fully engaged with Knowledge, you have problems. So, we have lots of problems. Trying not to have problems or trying to have fun instead of solving problems creates bigger problems or, should I say, emphasizes the big problem. Knowledge is solving problems all the time, but it solves only intermediate problems and the big problem. Why? Because the other problems are meant to be solved with your personal mind.</p>
<p>因此，让我再谈一谈一般的问题，然后我们将探讨解决小问题、中间问题，然后是大问题。首先，不要试图不出现问题。那是不明智的。因为你在与物理世界打交道，有许多实际问题需要解决。因为你有一个与生命脱节的个人心智，所以它有很多问题。因为你没有完全与内识打交道，所以你有问题。所以，我们有很多问题。试图不出现问题或试图获得乐趣而不是解决问题，会产生更大的问题，或者应该说，强调了大问题。内识一直在解决问题，但它只解决了中间的问题和大问题。为什么？因为其他问题是要用你的个人心智来解决的。</p>
<p>Many people say, “I can solve this problem. I’ll use common sense.” For instance, if you don’t brush your teeth, they rot away and that becomes a big nuisance. This is common sense. Common sense is like kindergarten Knowledge. It is like Knowledge at a very rudimentary level. That’s when something is obvious and it keeps bumping into you. If you don’t pay your bills, you will lose things. If you lie to people, trouble will come after you. This is all common sense, or kindergarten Knowledge. In other words, most people know these things, but they choose not to pay attention because it is not expedient in the moment to do so, or perhaps it will cost some money, or they will have to deal with some kind of discomfort in regard to it, or it will just be more effort in the daily living of life.</p>
<p>许多人说，”我能解决这个问题。我会用常识”。例如，如果你不刷牙，牙齿就会烂掉，这就成为一个大麻烦。这就是常识。常识就像幼儿园的知识。它就像非常初级水平的知识。这就是当某件事情很明显时，它就会不断地撞上你。如果你不支付你的账单，你会失去东西。如果你对人撒谎，麻烦就会找上你。这都是常识，或者说是幼儿园的知识。换句话说，大多数人都知道这些事情，但他们选择不注意，因为在当下这样做是不合适的，或者也许会花费一些钱，或者他们将不得不处理与之相关的某种不适，或者这只是在日常生活中的更多努力。</p>
<p>So, you are going to have problems, and they are going to be at all three levels because they already exist at all three levels. Little problems are problematic because you live in a physical universe. Intermediate problems are little problems that are not taken care of. And the big problem is that you are disassociated from Knowledge and from other living things as a result. This is everyone’s condition, so obviously learning to solve problems is very important.</p>
<p>所以，你会有问题，而且这些问题会在所有三个层面上，因为它们已经存在于所有三个层面。小问题是有问题的，因为你生活在一个物理宇宙中。中级问题是没有被照顾到的小问题。而大问题是，你与内识和其他生活事物关系的脱离。这是每个人的状况，所以显然学习解决问题是非常重要的。</p>
<p>Most little problems can be solved with your personal mind. That doesn’t mean they are all simple. It just means they can be figured out. In other words, if you started to turn on your car and the motor wouldn’t start, that is not a big problem. It may be a big nuisance, but it is not a big problem. Very rarely is it life threatening. So, should you go meditate on what to do? Perhaps. But it is common sense that will help you. Sometimes if you lose your keys, it will come to you where they are, but other times you may have to search the whole house. It is a little problem. You become more effective, more competent and more able in the physical world by solving these little problems, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>大多数小问题都可以用你的个人心智来解决。这并不意味着它们都很简单。它只是意味着它们可以被算出来。换句话说，如果你开始打开你的车，但马达无法启动，这并不是一个大问题。它可能是一个大麻烦，但它不是一个大问题。很少会威胁到生命。那么，你应该去冥想一下该怎么做吗？也许吧。但这是常识，会帮助你。有时，如果你丢了钥匙，它会来找你的位置，但其他时候，你可能不得不搜索整个房子。这是个小问题。通过解决这些小问题，你在物理世界中变得更有效，更有能力，一次又一次。</p>
<p>Most education is learning how to solve problems. So, why are people trying to get rid of their problems in order to be comfortable? That is like saying you don’t want to be educated. Now, if little problems are attended to without so much avoidance, denial and complaint, they don’t take up much of your life, and they enable you to become more aware, more conscientious and more capable in practical ways. This frees you to take on the big problem of life.</p>
<p>大多数教育就是学习如何解决问题。那么，为什么人们要试图摆脱他们的问题，以获得舒适？这就像说你不想接受教育。现在，如果小问题得到关注，没有那么多的回避、否认和抱怨，它们就不会占据你生命的大部分时间，而且它们能使你在实际生活中变得更有意识、更自觉、更有能力。这就使你能腾出手来解决生命中的大问题。</p>
<p>The big problem poses these questions: Who are you? Why are you here? What are you here to accomplish? How do you re-engage yourself with your deeper mind? This requires asking the same questions in different ways. It requires examining the big problem from many different angles. In fact, the problem is so big that people observe it in different ways and have very different interpretations. It is like looking at a huge thing, but you can’t see all of it. You can only see part of it. So, someone over here is looking at this part, and someone over there is looking at that part. And if they happen to communicate, they have entirely different stories about what they are experiencing. In this case, you may say the big problem is trying to become spiritually aware or the big problem is trying to become really honest with yourself or the big problem is discernment in relationships. This is all the same problem, but you are experiencing and observing it from different vantage points. This is the big problem. Even if you solve all of the little ones and have made yourself very comfortable in life, if the big problem is not attended to, you will not feel any relief and the little ones will still preoccupy you.</p>
<p>这个大问题提出了这些问题。你是谁？你为什么在这里？你在这里要完成什么？你如何使自己与你的更深层心智重新接触？这需要以不同的方式问同样的问题。它需要从许多不同的角度来审视这个大问题。事实上，这个问题是如此之大，以至于人们以不同的方式观察它，有非常不同的解释。这就像看着一座巨大的山，但你不能看到它的全部。你只能看到它的一部分。所以，这边有人在看这部分，那边有人在看那部分。如果他们碰巧交流，他们对自己所经历的事情有完全不同的故事。在这种情况下，你可能会说，最大的问题是试图成为精神上的意识，或者最大的问题是试图对自己变得真正诚实，或者最大的问题是在关系中的辨别力。这都是同一个问题，但你是从不同的观测点来经历和观察的。这就是大问题。即使你解决了所有的小问题，并使自己在生活中非常舒适，如果大问题没有得到关注，你将不会感到任何缓解，小问题仍然会困扰着你。</p>
<p>In an ideal or pure state living in the world, there are no intermediate problems. There are only little problems and the big problem, and most little problems can be solved by common sense. If they are neglected or avoided or if you are not aware of them, they become intermediate problems, and then Knowledge will help you. For instance, if you feel the need to go to the doctor because you have an ache and you don’t get the message and say to yourself, “Oh, I can’t afford it. I will deal with it some other way,” or something like this, eventually it becomes an intermediate problem, and Knowledge will start to prompt you to do something. You will start to feel that you must do something. You will feel the inner prompting of Knowledge. Why isn’t Knowledge more concerned with day-to-day kinds of problems, even the aggravating ones? Why? Because Knowledge is engaged in solving the big problem. The big problem is very big and affects every aspect of your life. If you are moving towards a resolution there, you are entering a new life. Here little problems continue, but they stay little.</p>
<p>在一个理想的或纯粹的状态下生活在这个世界上，没有中间的问题。只有小问题和大问题，大多数小问题可以通过常识解决。如果它们被忽视或回避，或者你没有意识到它们，它们就会变成中间问题，然后内识会帮助你。例如，如果你觉得有必要去看医生，因为你有疼痛感，而你没有得到这个讯息，并对自己说：”哦，我负担不起。我会以其他方式处理它，”或类似的说法，最终它变成了一个中间问题，而内识将开始促使你做一些事情。你会开始感觉到你必须做一些事情。你会感觉到内识的内在提示。为什么内识没有更多关注日常的各种问题，甚至是那些令人讨厌的问题？为什么呢？因为内识从事的是解决大问题的工作。大问题是非常大的，影响到你生命的各个方面。如果你在那里走向解决，你就进入了一个新的生命。在这里，小问题继续存在，但它们仍然是小问题。</p>
<p>What takes the place of problems? Freedom. If your little problems remain large and contentious and absorb all of your energy, you cannot attain freedom. What is freedom? Freedom is responding to the truth within yourself and following it. Your freedom is to be able to do this. This solves the big problem and enables you to experience your worth and purpose in the world. When that is happening, self-love is natural. When self-love is happening, your relationships fall into the right order. This is freedom. People think freedom is being able to do anything they want with a minimum of hindrances or obstructions. That is not freedom. Lack of hindrance is necessary up to a point, but it is not freedom. Think of someone living in a country where there is very little political freedom and take someone living in a country where there is a great deal of political freedom. The person in the latter case would have more advantages and opportunities, but it does not mean that they are solving the big problem in life any more effectively than the other person. It just means that their little problems are different.</p>
<p>什么取代了问题的位置？自由。如果你的小问题仍然很大，而且有争议，吸收了你所有的能量，你就不能获得自由。自由是什么？自由是对自己内心的真理做出回应，并遵循它。你的自由就是能够做到这一点。这就解决了大问题，使你能够经历到你在这个世界上的价值和目的。当这一切发生时，自爱是自然的。当自爱发生时，你的关系就会落入正确的顺序。这就是自由。人们认为自由是能够做任何他们想做的事，而没有任何阻碍或阻挠。这不是自由。缺少阻碍在一定程度上是必要的，但它不是自由。想想一个生活在政治自由度很低的国家的人，和一个生活在政治自由度很高的国家的人。后一种情况下的人将有更多的优势和机会，但这并不意味着他们比另一个人更有效地解决生活中的大问题。这只是意味着他们的小问题是不同的。</p>
<p>Remember that Knowledge is involved in solving the big problem and in keeping little problems little by enabling you to solve them at the level at which they occur. Because everyone has the big problem, it generates a lot of little ones that wouldn’t be there otherwise. For example, consider the idea of solving problems at the level at which they happen. This makes sense, but very few people can do it. Let me give you an example. If you lose your keys and go searching all over the house madly and you think, “This must have some spiritual significance for me,” or “This must represent some aspect of my psychology,” and you start getting involved in various kinds of speculation, then your little problem begins to represent something much bigger, and you get all caught up in the significance of this. Meanwhile, your keys are not found. They are waiting there somewhere for you to find them, but you are off in your mind doing something else.</p>
<p>请记住，内识涉及到解决大问题和保持小问题，使你能够在它们发生的层面上解决它们。因为每个人都有大问题，所以会产生很多小问题，否则就不会出现。例如，考虑在问题发生的层面上解决问题的想法。这是有道理的，但很少有人能做到这一点。让我给你举个例子。如果你丢了钥匙，疯狂地满屋子找，你想：”这对我来说一定有某种精神意义，”或者”这一定代表我心理的某些方面，”你开始参与各种猜测，然后你的小问题开始代表更大的问题，你完全陷入了这种意义之中。同时，你的钥匙还没有找到。它们就在某个地方等着你去找，但你却在心里做着别的事情。</p>
<p>When people get involved in their own personal development in a conscious and active way, often they inflate things tremendously. Everything that happens is significant to them. Everything they feel must be significant. All of their problems represent greater truths or greater disabilities in life. Losing your keys is normal. It will happen to you regardless of who you are. Even the man and woman of Knowledge will lose their keys. The man and woman of Knowledge will get sick and die. The difference is in their experience of Knowledge and where they are devoting their energy. Most of the things in the world that are engaging people and overtaking them are little problems that have become bigger. Either they have been neglected or given too much significance.</p>
<p>当人们以有意识的、积极的方式参与到自己的个人发展中时，他们往往会把事情夸大。发生的每件事对他们来说都很重要。他们感到的一切都必须是重要的。他们所有的问题都代表着更伟大的真理或生命中更大的障碍。丢失钥匙是正常的。无论你是谁，它都会发生在你身上。即使是内识的男人和女人也会丢失他们的钥匙。内识的男人和女人会生病和死亡。区别在于他们对内识的经历，以及他们将能量投入到哪里。世界上大多数与人打交道并超越他们的事情都是一些已经变得更大的小问题。它们要么被忽视了，要么被赋予了太多的意义。</p>
<p>Knowledge is engaged in the big things, but it keeps track of everything else. So, you lose your keys and you go to Knowledge and you say, “Where are my keys? I will meditate.” Sometimes it comes to you to look in a certain place, and you say, “Ah, wonderful! Knowledge is so good!” Other times you try to focus and there is nothing there and you end up having to look all over the house anyway. And then you think, “Well, maybe Knowledge doesn’t work.” Knowledge is involved in something much bigger than these kinds of things.</p>
<p>内识从事的是大事，但它保持着对其他一切的跟踪。所以，你丢了钥匙，你去找内识，你说：”我的钥匙在哪里？我将冥想。”有时，它来找你在某个地方，你说：”啊，太好了！”。内识是如此之好！”其他时候，你试图集中注意力，但那里什么也没有，最后你不得不在房子里到处找。然后你会想，”好吧，也许内识不起作用”。内识所涉及的事情要比这些事情大得多。</p>
<p>Often when people are beginning to learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, they pester themselves incessantly with questions about what they should do about this and what they should do about that and how they can earn more money and how they can find true love and how they can get rid of aches and pains and on and on and on. There is no inner response and they say, “Either I am too stupid to get Knowledge, or maybe Knowledge doesn’t exist.” Knowledge is involved in something much bigger than these questions. It is like a scientist working on an important discovery.</p>
<p>通常，当人们开始学习大社区内识之路时，他们会不停地纠缠自己，问自己应该怎么做这个，应该怎么做那个，如何才能赚更多的钱，如何才能找到真爱，如何才能摆脱疼痛，等等，不一而足。内心没有回应，他们说：”要么是我太笨了，无法得到内识，要么是内识不存在”。内识所涉及的问题比这些问题大得多。它就像一个科学家在研究一个重要的发现。</p>
<p>You must solve ninety percent of your problems. Be resourceful. Seek help. Learn things. This is your education in being a human being. This is how you mature as a human being: by accepting these problems, by learning to become resourceful and by solving them. But you do not want intermediate problems, for they will rob you of your time, energy and focus in life.</p>
<p>你必须解决百分之九十的问题。要足智多谋。寻求帮助。学习事物。这是你作为一个人的教育。这就是你作为一个人成熟的方式：通过接受这些问题，通过学习变得足智多谋，通过解决这些问题。但你不想要中间问题，因为它们会夺走你的时间、能量和生命重心。</p>
<p>Now let us talk about the big problem. The big problem is so big that you can’t put it all into a single definition. If you have learned to solve little problems sufficiently or can keep track of them as they arise, then perhaps you will cross another threshold and enter a greater dimension of your life. Here there is a greater problem, and here there are rewards that wouldn’t be available to you unless you had sought this greater resolution in your life. Not only is there resolution, there is accomplishment and with it all of the things that you have come into the world to serve. Knowledge is here. Meaning is here—the underlying meaning of how you do things and who you are. Here the emphasis is not so much on little problems but on the whole environment in which they exist. Alter this environment, and everything changes with it. Problems don’t go away. They are just minimized and become more interesting. Very few people enter this level of problem solving. This is advancement.</p>
<p>现在让我们来谈谈大问题。大问题是如此之大，以至于你不能把它全部归入一个单一的定义。如果你已经学会了充分解决小问题，或者能够在小问题出现时跟踪它们，那么也许你将跨过另一道门槛，进入你生命的更大层面。这里有一个更大的问题，这里有奖励，如果你没有在你的生命中寻求这个更大的解决方法，就不会有奖励。不仅有决议，还有成就，以及随之而来的你来到世界上要服务的所有事件。内识在这里。意义就在这里——你如何做事和你是谁的根本意义。在这里，重点不在于小问题，而在于他们存在的整个环境。改变这个环境，一切都会随之改变。问题并没有消失。它们只是被最小化，变得更加有趣。很少有人进入这个解决问题的层次。这就是进步。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, much of the competition is for intelligence. Intelligence is developed both within the context of an individual’s life and over the span of generations in his or her particular race by solving problems—little ones and in some cases, the big one itself. Knowledge is there. Knowledge is working on the big problem. Knowledge is guiding you to solve the intermediate ones. And for the little ones Knowledge is saying to you, “Work it out. Work it out. Work it out.” You can see here why people cannot comprehend Knowledge—its presence, its reality or its Wisdom. They have little problems which have become big to them. They are asking Knowledge to solve them and Knowledge is saying, “Work it out. Work it out.” They say, “I can’t work it out! It is too big! It is too difficult!” Knowledge says, “Work it out.” Knowledge is not understood here because people think little problems are enormously huge.</p>
<p>在大社区里，大部分的竞争都是针对智力与能力的。智能是在一个人的生命范围内，以及在其特定种族的几代人中，通过解决问题——小问题，以及在某些情况下，大问题本身来发展。内识就在那里。内识正在为大问题而努力。内识正在指导你解决中间的问题。对于小问题，内识在对你说：”解决它。解决它。解决它。”你可以在这里看到为什么人们不能理解内识——它的存在、它的现实或它的智慧。他们有一些小问题，但对他们来说已经变成了大问题。他们要求内识来解决这些问题，而内识则说：”解决它。解决它。”他们说：”我不能解决它！它太大了！”。它太大了！它太难了！它太难了！”内识说，”解决它”。内识在这里不被理解，因为人们认为小问题是非常巨大的。</p>
<p>When you solve problems and you get most of them out of the way, what do you have left? You have emptiness. This is the invitation to go into the mystery of your life, but many people do not realize this. With no problems to solve, they become frustrated, anxiety sets in and then emptiness.</p>
<p>当你解决了问题，你把大部分问题都解决了，你还剩下什么？你有空虚。这是进入你生命之谜的邀请，但许多人没有意识到这一点。由于没有问题需要解决，他们变得沮丧，焦虑不安，然后是空虚。</p>
<p>In the realm of the big problem, you work with Knowledge, you follow Knowledge and Knowledge teaches you how to address all the practical dilemmas involved. It teaches you how to address the adjustments you need to make in your own thinking and in your emotional life. When you work with Knowledge, you receive the greatness of Knowledge, the silence of Knowledge, the mystery of Knowledge, the discernment of Knowledge and the peace of Knowledge.</p>
<p>在大问题的领域里，你与内识一起工作，你遵循内识，内识教你如何解决所有涉及的实际困境。它教你如何解决你在自己的思维和情感生活中需要做出的调整。当你与内识一起工作时，你会得到内识的伟大、内识的沉默、内识的神秘、内识的辨别力和内识的和平。</p>
<p>It is true that the wiser a person becomes, the fewer little problems they have and the more they treasure emptiness so that they can engage with Knowledge in a big way. At the outset, a person is overtaken by little problems and intermediate problems, so often the first thing that happens in following The Way of Knowledge is learning how to resolve these things so that you are free to go on to something greater. And the funny thing is, you have to do it yourself. You can get help, but you have to do it. It is when you cross that threshold and you enter the mystery of your life and you take on bigger problems without neglecting the little ones that you enter the realm of the big problem. That is when Knowledge becomes something very real. Over time, if you persist, you will feel its greatness, and you will begin to understand its intention. Before this, Knowledge is just a strange and intriguing idea but hardly useful in solving little problems, which are usually thought to be big problems.</p>
<p>诚然，一个人变得越明智，他们的小问题就越少，他们就越珍惜空虚，这样他们就能与内识打交道。一开始，一个人就会被一些小问题和中间问题所困扰，所以在遵循内识之路的过程中，首先要做的就是学习如何解决这些问题，这样你就可以自由地去做更大的事情。有趣的是，你必须自己去做。你可以得到帮助，但你必须这样做。当你跨过那道门槛，进入你生命的神秘，你承担更大的问题而不忽视小问题时，你才进入了大问题的领域。这就是内识成为非常真实的时期。随着时间的推移，如果你坚持下去，你会感到它的伟大，你会开始理解它的意图。在此之前，内识只是一个奇怪的、耐人寻味的想法，但在解决小问题时几乎没有用处，而这些问题通常被认为是大问题。</p>
<p>Another way of saying this is when you learn to solve little problems efficiently so that you have very few of them with you at any given time, and you are able to deal with them as expediently as possible, then you graduate into a different kind of problem solving in life and a different kind of life altogether. Here you can begin to see the problem for beginning students of Knowledge. This includes almost everyone in the world, since advanced students of Knowledge generally are not even on the physical plane here. So, be happy to be a beginner. You can see the problem for beginning students of Knowledge. They think their little problems are big; they think their big problem is little or they don’t think of it at all. And they seek divine intervention or divine counsel on their behalf. They seek Wisdom, but their whole approach is wrong. Their whole evaluation is incorrect. So, what happens? Misunderstanding, confusion, anxiety and resentment. They don’t understand. Knowledge was supposed to come and help them out and reveal itself! Often even common sense is beyond the reach of people. They can’t even engage with that, so what is the point of seeking something greater?</p>
<p>另一种说法是，当你学会有效地解决小问题，使你在任何时候都只有很少的问题，而且你能够尽可能迅速地处理这些问题，那么你就毕业了，你就进入了生命中另一种层次的解决问题方式和完全不同的生活。在这里，你可以开始看到初学内识的学生所面临的问题。这几乎包括世界上的每一个人，因为内识的高级学生一般都不在这里的物质层面上。所以，要高兴地做一名初学者。你可以看到内识的初级学生的问题。他们认为他们的小问题是大问题；他们认为他们的大问题是小问题，或者他们根本就没有想到这个问题。而且他们为自己寻求上帝的干预或上帝的建议。他们寻求智慧，但他们的整个方法是错误的。他们的整个评估是不正确的。那么，会发生什么？误解、困惑、焦虑和怨恨。他们不明白。内识本来是要来帮助他们的，并揭示它自己的！但他们却不知道。通常，即使是常识也是人们无法企及的。他们甚至不能参与其中，那么寻求更大的问题有什么意义呢？</p>
<p>There are many issues here. For instance, when people are getting engaged in exploring the possibility that they have a spiritual life, they often think that if they are doing the right thing, everything works out great. Doors open for you. Nothing is that difficult. If something is difficult, well, then something must be wrong in your approach, or something like this. This is completely wrong! When you are doing the right thing, sometimes things happen very easily and wonderfully. Sometimes when you are doing the right thing, things are very difficult with lots of obstacles and you have to work very hard to overcome them. Sometimes when you are doing the wrong thing, everything seems to work out and is easy until you realize how wrong it is. Sometimes when you are doing the wrong thing, it is very difficult and there are tons of obstacles to overcome, except that here you cannot overcome them. So, do not be fooled by the appearance of things. Because something is hard or problematic doesn’t necessarily mean it is incorrect for you to be engaged with it. The true way in life for you will be wonderfully easy at times, and at other times it will be very difficult. The wrong way will sometimes look easy but will always be difficult.</p>
<p>这里有很多问题。例如，当人们开始参与探索他们有精神生活的可能性时，他们往往认为如果他们做的是正确的事，一切都会很顺利。门会为你打开。没有什么是那么困难的。如果有什么困难，那么你的方法一定有问题，或者类似这样的问题。这是完全错误的!当你在做正确的事情时，有时事情会非常容易和美妙地发生。有时当你做正确的事情时，事情会非常困难，有很多障碍，你必须非常努力地工作才能克服它们。有时当你做错事时，一切似乎都很顺利，很容易，直到你意识到它是多么错误。有时当你在做错事时，是非常困难的，有大量的障碍需要克服，只是在这里你无法克服。所以，不要被事物的表象所迷惑。因为某些事情很难或有问题，并不一定意味着你参与其中是不正确的。对你来说，真实的生活方式有时会非常容易，有时则会非常困难。错误的方法有时看起来很容易，但总是很困难。</p>
<p>Therefore, the approach to building Wisdom is to learn to solve little problems at the level at which they occur and to keep them from becoming intermediate problems or chronic problems. Keep them small, but don’t neglect them, and then begin to engage with the real problem in your life, which is following a path towards realization and contribution. Both are necessary, not one without the other. If you go off towards a spiritual life and you forget about paying your bills or keeping track of your keys or maintaining your physical health, you will be in for many kinds of difficulties and you will not go very far. So, you must do both. Your little problems will lessen as you learn not to avoid them but to attend to them as soon as you are aware of them. Then you are free to save part of your time, focus and concentration for the big problem.</p>
<p>因此，建立智慧的方法是学会在发生小问题时就解决它们，并使它们不成为中间问题或慢性问题。保持小问题，但不要忽视它们，然后开始处理你生命中的真正问题，也就是走一条通往实现和贡献的道路。两者都是必要的，不能缺一不可。如果你走向精神生活，而忘记了支付账单或记录你的钥匙或保持你的身体健康，你将会遇到许多种困难，你将不会走得很远。所以，你必须两者都做。你的小问题会减少，因为你学会了不回避它们，而是一旦意识到它们，就立即去处理它们。然后你就可以自由地把你的部分时间、注意力和集中力留给大问题。</p>
<p>As you approach the big problem, you will realize that you cannot define it and your definitions will have to change. This will lead you to adhere to a Greater Power within you and within the world. You are called on to be cooperative with the Greater Power rather than be a recipient of it only. The big problem is not something you just solve and it’s over with. It is something you live with, and as you learn to live with the problem in a conscious and effective way, you learn to live the resolution. You cannot escape the big problem. You either live it in its unsolved state or you live the resolution, but you are always with it. It is always there for you.</p>
<p>当你接近大问题时，你会意识到你无法定义它，你的定义将不得不改变。这将导致你坚持在你和世界中的一个更伟大的力量。你被要求与伟大的力量合作，而不是只做它的接受者。大问题不是你解决了就完事了。它是你生命的一部分，当你学会以一种有意识的、有效的方式与问题相处时，你就学会了如何解决。你无法逃避这个大问题。你要么在未解决的状态下生活，要么在解决的状态下生活，但你总是和它在一起。它总是在你身边。</p>
<p>As you proceed along the way, many of your former conclusions, assumptions and beliefs fall away, and what takes their place is openness. Real openness, not a pretend openness. Real openness. This means you can be empty and open to a situation, carefully observant of it and responsible to what you know. Problems can be avoided if this is your approach. You will want to minimize your complaints about life because complaints disable you from resolving things that are within your grasp to resolve. What you can resolve alone are the little problems. What you cannot resolve alone is the big problem. For the little problems you need help from Knowledge periodically. For the big problem you will need Knowledge completely. Not only will you need Knowledge, you must join with Knowledge. You must unite with Knowledge. You must let Knowledge overtake you, teach you and prepare you. This is where your mental life and your spiritual life become joined, married and united. This completely transforms you as a person so that you can begin to live the big problem and to live its resolution.</p>
<p>当你沿着这条路前进时，你以前的许多结论、假设和信念都会消失，取而代之的是开放。真正的开放，而不是假装的开放。真正的开放。这意味着你可以对一个情况空虚和开放，仔细观察它，对你所知道的负责。如果这是你的方法，问题是可以避免的。你要尽量减少对生活的抱怨，因为抱怨使你无法解决那些在你能力范围内可以解决的事情。你能独自解决的是小问题。你不能单独解决的是大问题。对于小问题，你需要定期得到内识的帮助。对于大问题，你将完全需要内识。你不仅需要内识，你还必须与内识结合。你必须与内识联合起来。你必须让内识超越你，教导你，为你准备。这就是你的心理生活和你的精神生活的结合，婚姻和联合。这完全改变了你作为一个人的身份，使你可以开始生活在大问题中，并生活在其解决方案中。</p>
<p>To a casual observer perhaps you will not look any different. You will still have to find your keys; you will still have to fix your car; you will still have to get your physical aches attended to, and you will still have to make enough money to live. But here the similarities end, for we are dealing with a person living in a different universe, a different life with a different mind—so different that there is no comparison.</p>
<p>对一个不经意的观察者来说，也许你看起来没有任何不同。你仍然必须找到你的钥匙；你仍然必须修理你的汽车；你仍然必须让你的身体疼痛得到解决，你仍然必须赚到足够的钱来生活。但相似之处到此为止，因为我们面对的是一个生活在不同宇宙中的人，一个有着不同心智的生命——如此不同，没有可比性。</p>
<p>This is possible for you. Begin today to accept the presence of all the little problems in your life and accept that it is given to you, with the assistance of others, to resolve them and to minimize them so that you can take on the big problem that is calling for you, that is awaiting you, whose resolution is awaiting you with rewards that are beyond human estimation. Here you learn to support yourself. You learn about your nature, which is how you do things, your thinking and behavior. You learn about the nature of others and their similarities and differences from your own nature. You realize your inner strength. Your priorities begin to change and you seek greater things. To reach these greater things you will seek a Greater Power, for greater things can only be acquired or received with a Greater Power. Take on the big problem of your life, do not neglect the little ones and you will open doors that are waiting for you, for they are open already.</p>
<p>这对你来说是可能的。今天开始接受你生命中所有小问题的存在，并接受在别人的帮助下，把它们解决掉，把它们降到最低，这样你就可以处理大问题，这个问题正在呼唤你，正在等待你，它的解决正以超出人类估计的回报等待你。在这里，你学会了支持自己。你学习你的本性，也就是你做事的方式，你的思维和行为。你学习他人的天性，以及他们与你自己的本性的相似和不同。你意识到自己的内在力量。你的优先事项开始改变，你寻求更大的事情。为了达到这些更大的事情，你将寻求一种更伟大的力量，因为更伟大的事情只有在更伟大的力量下才能获得或接受。着手解决你生命中的大问题，不要忽视小问题，你会打开那些等待你的门，因为它们已经打开了。</p>
