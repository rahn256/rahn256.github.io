<p>As revealed to God’s Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on October 22, 1993 in Boulder, CO<br>1993年10月22日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, CO)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Education in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is quite unique. It calls upon a different kind of intelligence within you and creates a pathway to this intelligence that is quite distinct from your normal forms of education. Here you do not set about to remember facts and figures, equations and details. Here you seek to wed your intellect with your deeper mind, the mind we call Knowledge. Here the emphasis is on developing stillness and the ability to focus on things objectively—two very high functions of the mind.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路的教育是相当独特的。它唤起了你内在不同的智能，并创造了一条通向这种智能的途径，与你的正常教育形式截然不同。在这里，你不是为了记住事实、数字、公式和细节。在这里，你寻求将你的智力与你更深层的心智结合起来，也就是我们称之为内识的心智。这里的重点是发展静止和客观地关注事物的能力——这是心智的两个非常高的功能。</p>
<p>Because Knowledge does not think like your personal mind, there has to be a bridge built between them. Building this bridge enables Knowledge to communicate to you and enables you to receive its guidance, its blessings and its protection. Without this bridge, you will feel like you are split between your personal mind, which thinks one way and wants certain things, and Knowledge, which thinks in a different way and has a greater purpose than the personal mind. Building this bridge represents the purpose of education in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因为内识的思考方式与你的个人心智不同，所以必须在它们之间建立一座桥梁。建立这座桥梁使内识能够与你沟通，使你能够收到它的指导、它的祝福和它的保护。如果没有这座桥梁，你会觉得自己被分裂在个人心智和内识之间，前者以一种方式思考，想要某些东西，而后者则以另一种方式思考，并且比个人心智有更大的目的。建立这座桥代表了大社区内识之路的教育目的。</p>
<p>To prepare, you will need several significant things. First, you will need the correct preparation. You cannot use human spirituality, human philosophy, human idealism and human motivations to attain a Greater Community understanding of Knowledge. Instead, you will need a unique form of education, which we are providing for you here. Human wisdom and human understanding will only take you so far. This is a greater mountain to climb. You will need a special focus, a map and a pathway in order to undertake the great preparation in The Way of Knowledge. In addition, you will need the correct curriculum, instruction, attitude, companions and way of evaluating your progress.</p>
<p>为了准备，你将需要几个重要的东西。首先，你将需要正确的准备。你不能用人类的精神、人类的哲学、人类的理想主义和人类的动机来达到大社区对内识的理解。相反，你将需要一种独特的教育形式，我们在这里为你提供这种教育。人类的智慧和人类的理解只能带你到这里。这是一座需要攀登的更大的山。你将需要一个特别的焦点，一个地图和一条路径，以便进行内识之路的伟大准备。此外，你还需要正确的课程、指导、态度、同伴和评估进展的方式。</p>
<p>As we have mentioned, the curriculum is vital. You must take the correct way up the mountain or you will lose your way; you will come to a dead end and find yourself meandering about, not certain where you are going. The curriculum that we are providing is designed specifically to enable men and women to gain a greater understanding of life—a Greater Community understanding and perspective, which establish a greater vantage point from which to see yourself and others with compassion and understanding.</p>
<p>正如我们所提到的，课程是至关重要的。你必须采取正确的方式上山，否则你会迷失方向；你会走到死胡同，发现自己四处游荡，不确定自己要去哪里。我们提供的课程是专门为使男人和女人获得对生命的更大理解而设计的——一种大社区理解和视角，这建立了一个更大的观测点，从那里以同情和理解来看待自己和他人。</p>
<p>If you alter the curriculum or try to marry it to other things you are accustomed to or to things that you appreciate, you will not find the correct way, and you will not progress. You must follow the way as it is given—without altering it, without deleting anything and without adding on things that you learned before. In fact, here you must really begin as a beginner. Forget what you have learned. Leave aside your ideas and your philosophy. Do not try to make this new education the same as something else. Do not try to make it continuous with something else. You cannot learn a Greater Community Way of Knowledge based upon a previous education. You must start from the beginning and be a beginner. This approach is the wisest one, for this enables you to proceed with an open mind and to escape the limitations that your assumptions, beliefs and attitudes will certainly place upon you.</p>
<p>如果你改变课程，或试图将其与你习惯的或你欣赏的事物结合起来，你将找不到正确的方法，你也不会进步。你必须按照原样进行学习——不做任何修改，不删减任何内容，也不添加你以前学到的东西。事实上，在这里你必须真正从初学者开始。忘记你所学到的，放下你的想法和哲学。不要试图让这门新教育与其他教育相同，不要试图让它与其他教育相连续。你不能在以前的教育基础上学习大社区的内识方式。你必须从头开始，做一个初学者。这种方法是最明智的，因为这能使你以开放的心态进行，摆脱你的假设、信仰和态度必然给你带来的限制。</p>
<p>The correct curriculum requires the correct attitude. The correct attitude is one of a beginner. If you have a beginner’s mind, you will have an open mind. Here you will be able to see things as they are and not as you think they must be or prefer them to be. Here there is a great distinction between an education in Knowledge and the education that you have found in the world. In the world, you always build upon what you have learned in the past, adding new things as you go along. As you advance, you become more selective in what you learn because you want to validate what you have learned already. Thus, the intent of education, which is to learn something new, to experience something new and to be able to do something new, becomes lost because increasingly you will attempt to validate the past. Here you will become more fearful and anxious about the future, less willing to see things as they really are and less open to new ideas, new experiences and new capabilities. Here the mind closes down upon itself. It often does this with the belief that it is open and accessible when in fact it has become such a filtering mechanism that very little new information can come to it, either from within or from without.</p>
<p>正确的课程需要有正确的态度。正确的态度是一个初学者的态度。如果你有一个初学者的心态，你就会有一个开放的心灵。在这里，你将能够看到课程的本来面目，而不是你认为它们必须是或希望它们是的样子。在这里，内识的教育和你在世界中找到的教育之间有很大的区别。在这个世界上，你总是建立在你过去所学的基础之上，在你前进的过程中增加新的知识。随着你的进步，你对你所学的知识变得更加有选择性，因为你想验证你已经学到的知识。因此，教育的本意，即学习新的知识，体验新的事物，能够做新的事情，变得迷失了，因为你越来越试图验证过去。在这里，你会变得对未来更加恐惧和焦虑，不愿意看到学习的真实情况，不愿意对新的想法、新的经验和新的能力进行开放。在这里，心灵会自我封闭。它经常这样做，认为自己是开放的，可以进入的，但事实上心灵已经成为一个过滤机制，很少有新的信息可以进入它，无论是来自内部还是外部。</p>
<p>How different is The Way of Knowledge. How different is the preparation in learning Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Here you must start from the beginning and constantly set aside things you think you understand, things that you believe in, things that you believe have to be in the world and things you hold true about yourself, others and life in general. You must keep opening yourself to something new. What you will experience will confirm Knowledge within you and open new arenas of experience to you. Here you will find yourself venturing into the unknown with only Knowledge and the strength of your companions to assure you. This open attitude is essential throughout your preparation. As soon as you think you fully understand the curriculum and can define it for yourself and others, your progress will stop. Here you can make some very dangerous and unhappy conclusions.</p>
<p>内识之路是多么不同。学习大社区内识和智慧的准备是多么不同。在这里，你必须从头开始，不断地把你认为自己理解的想法、你相信的想法、你认为必须存在于这个世界上以及你认为对自己、对他人和对整个生命都是真实的想法放在一边。你必须不断向新的智慧开放自己。你将体验的智慧将证实你内心的内识，并向你打开新的经验领域。在这里，你会发现自己在未知的环境中冒险，只有内识和同伴的力量可以保证你。在整个准备过程中，这种开放的态度是必不可少的。一旦你认为你完全理解了课程，并能为自己和他人定义它，你的进展就会停止。在这里，你可以做出一些非常危险和不愉快的结论。</p>
<p>Learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge is a great undertaking and preparation. You cannot study it for a few weeks or a few months or a few years and master it. That is why we say there are no masters in the world. There are only proficient students. Therefore, seek to become a proficient student, which will indeed make you seem masterful to others. However, as soon as you think that you have arrived and that your education is complete, your studenthood will come to an end, and your mind will begin to close in upon itself. You will stop where you are and begin to slide backwards.</p>
<p>学习大社区的内识方式是一项伟大的事业和准备。你不可能学习几个星期或几个月或几年就掌握它。这就是为什么我们说世界上没有大师。有的只是熟练的学生。因此，要设法成为一个熟练的学生，这确实会使你在别人看来是个大师。然而，一旦你认为你已经到达，你的教育已经完成，你的学生身份就会结束，你的心灵会开始自我封闭。你会停在原地，开始向后滑动。</p>
<p>You can see the evidence of this in the self-proclaimed leadership of many people who profess to know great things and have great methodologies. However, unless their minds are fresh and open, unless they are pliable and can adapt to new experiences, these people become increasingly fixated upon the past and increasingly defensive about their own position and understanding. As a result, they become increasingly selective about what they will experience and less and less open to life, to relationship, to Knowledge and to real Wisdom.</p>
<p>你可以从许多人自称的领导力中看到这个证据，他们自称知道伟大的使命，拥有伟大的方法论。然而，除非他们的心灵是新鲜和开放的，除非他们是柔韧的，能够适应新的经验，否则这些人变得越来越固执于过去，对自己的立场和理解越来越防备。结果，他们对自己将经历的事情越来越有选择性，对生命、对关系、对内识和对真正的智慧越来越不开放。</p>
<p>The correct attitude must also include the willingness to correct anything that obstructs the reclamation of Knowledge—those beliefs, those attitudes, those ambitions, those cherished needs and those personal demands that infringe on and limit your ability to experience life as it is, as it will be the next moment and as it is destined to be in the future. This takes great courage and a desire for honesty. Indeed, this far exceeds most people’s definition of and boundaries for honesty. Here you must continue to push the boundary of honesty and come back to what you know, which is distinct from what you want or believe. This is an act of personal integrity and a statement of real honesty.</p>
<p>正确的态度还必须包括愿意纠正任何阻碍内识开垦的东西——那些信仰、那些态度、那些野心、那些珍视的需求和那些个人要求，它们侵犯和限制了你体验生命的能力，因为它是现在的，它将是下一刻的，它注定将是未来的。这需要极大的勇气和对诚实的渴望。事实上，这远远超过了大多数人对诚实的定义和界限。在这里，你必须继续推动诚实的界限，回到你所知道的，这与你想要的或相信的东西不同。这是一种个人诚信的行为，也是真正诚实的声明。</p>
<p>You must love the truth more than anything else, and your love of the truth must grow. You must be able to feel the truth as distinct from other forms of stimulation—self-validation, pleasure, fulfillment or anything else—for the truth has its own experience, which is unique. As you are able to identify it, value it and experience it again and again, you will want to return to it. Here you learn to make your own wise decisions, and as you learn to make your own wise decisions, you will be able to help others to make wise decisions for themselves.</p>
<p>你必须爱真理胜过一切，而且你对真理的爱必须增长。你必须能够感觉到真理有别于其他形式的刺激——自我肯定、快乐、满足或其他任何刺激——因为真理有它自己的经历，是独一无二的。当你能够识别它、重视它并反复体验它时，你就会想回到它身边。在这里，你学会了做出自己明智的决定，当你学会做出自己明智的决定时，你将能够帮助别人为自己做出明智的决定。</p>
<p>Because the preparation is so great and requires so much time and patience, we encourage you to go slowly and consistently. We encourage you to practice daily but without a sense of urgency or impatience. There are many things you must learn the first year. There are many things you must learn the next year, the year after and the year after that. You cannot see what is up ahead for you to learn.</p>
<p>由于准备工作是如此之大，需要如此多的时间和耐心，我们鼓励你缓慢而持续地进行。我们鼓励你每天练习，但不要有紧迫感或不耐烦。有许多准备你必须在第一年学会。明年、后年和大后年你必须学习许多准备。你看不到前面有什么需要你学习的。</p>
<p>Beginning students always think that they are on the verge of accomplishment. Intermediate students think they are on the verge of mastery. Advanced students realize they are on the verge of simply learning the next step. This represents a mature attitude, an attitude that recognizes the challenge, the difficulty, the need and the reward. You must advance far enough to gain this mature approach. Advanced age in life does not guarantee this mature approach. Advancement in The Way of Knowledge and advancement in true preparation are the only things that can assure this. This will show you the true lessons in life and how difficult they are to learn, how necessary they are to learn and what the results of learning them are. Your experience will confirm this.</p>
<p>初学者总是认为他们处于成就的边缘。中级学生认为他们正处于掌握的边缘。高级学生意识到他们正处在简单地学习下一步的边缘。这代表了一种成熟的态度，一种认识到挑战、困难、需要和回报的态度。你必须前进得足够远才能获得这种成熟的方法。生命中的高龄并不能保证这种成熟的方法。在内识之路上的进步和在真正准备上的进步是唯一能保证这一点的方法。这将向你展示生命中真实的课程，以及它们有多难学，它们有多需要学，学了它们的结果是什么。你的经历将证实这一点。</p>
<p>This will put you in a position to wisely counsel others. This is why only an advanced student in The Way of Knowledge can teach The Way of Knowledge. Many people want to pass on everything they are learning as soon as possible, and this is understandable. However, do not claim real comprehension, for the Mystery will exceed your understanding, always. When you can be immersed in the Mystery, you can represent the Mystery. Then you can teach in a whole new way. Then you will understand why the preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is unique among all other forms of education. Yet even in the uniqueness of this education—its unique goal and the greater dimensions of reality that it will expose you to—it holds in common many things that you have learned already in the world. Let us illustrate this now.</p>
<p>这将使你处于明智地劝告他人的位置。这就是为什么只有内识之路的高级学生才能教授内识之路。许多人想尽快传授他们所学的一切，这是可以理解的。但是，不要声称自己真正理解了，因为神秘的内识将永远超过你的理解。当你能沉浸在神秘之中时，你就能代表神秘。然后你就能以一种全新的方式进行教学。然后你就会明白为什么大社区内识之路的准备工作在所有其他形式的教育中是独一无二的。然而，即使在这种教育的独特性中——它的独特目标和它将使你接触到的现实的更大层面——它也拥有你在这个世界上已经学到的许多准备。现在让我们来说明这一点。</p>
<p>Education requires a wise instructor, someone who is competent and who understands the learning process at hand. You can only take yourself so far. Even when you try to teach yourself simple and mechanical things, you make yourself vulnerable to grave error, and it takes much more time and energy to advance. It is better to assign yourself to a capable and competent instructor. If you attempt to learn the way yourself, you will take a very slow and difficult path. In fact, many people choose to do this because they are too afraid to work with an instructor, or because they have grandiose ideas about themselves and think that an instructor is not necessary and that they can learn on their own. Some people do not want to commit the time and resources to their education substantially enough to engage with an instructor, when a true instructor will in fact save them time and energy and preserve their resources for the future. You have learned this already. To learn an athletic sport, to learn an art, to learn any kind of skill requires wise instruction. Someone must show you, and someone must correct you as you proceed and try things out for yourself.</p>
<p>教育需要一位明智的指导者，一个有能力并且理解学习过程的人。你只能把自己带到这么远。即使你尝试教自己简单和机械的事物，你也会使自己容易出现严重的错误，并且需要花费更多的时间和精力才能取得进步。更好的方法是找到一位有能力和胜任的导师。如果你尝试自己学习这条道路，你将走上一条非常缓慢和困难的道路。事实上，许多人选择这样做是因为他们太害怕与导师合作，或者因为他们对自己有夸大的想法，认为导师是不必要的，他们可以自己学习。有些人不想把时间和资源实质性地投入到他们的教育中去，不想与指导者打交道，而事实上，真实的导师会节省他们的时间和能量，为他们的未来保留资源。你已经学到了这一点。学习一项运动，学习一门艺术，学习任何技能都需要明智的指导。必须有人向你展示，在你进行和自己尝试的过程中必须有人纠正你。</p>
<p>Your education has also taught you that you must practice what you seek to learn. How obvious this is and yet how much it escapes so many people who attempt to find a quick and easy way to bypass the years of work that are required to build an awareness and to lay a foundation for Wisdom. People say, “Give me the answer. Show me the method. Give me the secret. I can use it. I understand it. I will not fail with it.” how foolish this is and how unwise.</p>
<p>你的教育也告诉你，你必须实践你所寻求的学习。这一点是多么明显，但许多人却忽略了这一点，他们试图找到一种快速和简单的方法来绕过多年的工作，而这些工作是建立意识和为智慧打下基础所必需的。人们说，”给我答案。告诉我方法。给我这个秘密。我可以使用它。我理解它。我不会失败。”这是多么愚蠢，多么不明智。</p>
<p>For example, if you want to learn a technical skill, you must practice and study. You must have a good instructor. You must have your direction and purpose clarified as you go along. You must take a path where you can mature in your skill and understanding. Reading a book or going to a class can only introduce you to the preparation. They are not the preparation itself. Only a book that contains the actual practices can take you into the preparation and further you and advance you there. Yet you will still need instruction. You will still need to associate with those who are wiser and more advanced than you are. And you will need to associate with those who are less advanced than you are. Those more advanced can pass on their Wisdom and help save you time and energy. Those less advanced can benefit from the results of your accomplishments and thus validate and verify the importance of your endeavor.</p>
<p>例如，如果你想学习一项技术技能，你必须练习和学习。你必须有一个好的指导者。你必须在前进的过程中明确你的方向和目的。你必须走一条可以使你的技能和理解成熟的道路。阅读一本书或去上课只能向你介绍准备工作。它们不是准备工作本身。只有包含实际做法的书才能带你进入准备阶段，使你更进一步，并在那里推进你。然而你仍然需要指导。你仍然需要与那些比你更聪明、更先进的人交往。你也需要与那些比你落后的人交往。那些更先进的人可以传授他们的智慧，帮助你节省时间和能量。那些不太先进的人可以从你的成就中受益，从而验证和确认你的努力的重要性。</p>
<p>Your education has already taught you, then, that you need wise instruction and that you need to practice. Your practice must be consistent, diligent, patient and effective. Do not think that you can master things that are important in a short period of time. If you do, you will end up taking the long and difficult road. Do not look at the mountain and say, “I know a better way up this mountain!” You have never been on this mountain before. You do not know what it is like at its higher altitude. You do not know what the requirements are. You do not know what impact the environment will have on you. You do not know the way. And yet how many people scramble feverishly, trying to carve their own way and end up getting stuck, unable to proceed.</p>
<p>那么，你的教育已经告诉你，你需要明智的指导，你需要实践。你的实践必须是一致的、勤奋的、耐心的和有效的。不要以为你可以在短时间内掌握重要的技能。如果你这样做，你最终会走上漫长而艰难的道路。不要看着山说：”我知道有更好的方法上这座山！”你以前从未上过这座山。你不知道它的高海拔是什么样子。你不知道有什么要求。你不知道环境会对你产生什么影响。你不知道路怎么走。然而，有多少人狂热地争夺，试图开辟自己的道路，最后却被卡住，无法继续前进。</p>
<p>Your education in the world has shown you another truth that is applicable here. You must immerse yourself in your preparation in order to advance, to comprehend and to learn the application of whatever skill you are attempting to understand and to become competent at. You cannot dabble with this and dabble with that and do a little of this and do a little of that. If you are to become a student of a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, it will require all of your attention. Not only will you have to master and understand human Wisdom, you will have to learn Greater Community Wisdom. However, every little bit that you advance towards a Greater Community understanding will make you more effective, more capable, more gracious and more compassionate as a person. You will be more able to help others with the simple problems in life and with the greater problems in life.</p>
<p>你在世界范围内的教育已经向你展示了另一个适用于此的真理。你必须沉浸在你的准备工作中，以推进、理解和学习应用你试图理解和成为合格的任何技能。你不能掺杂这个，掺杂那个，做一点这个，做一点那个。如果你要成为一个大社区内识之路的学生，它需要你的全部注意力。你不仅要掌握和理解人类的智慧，你还必须学习大社区的智慧。然而，你对大社区理解的每一点进步都会使你作为一个人更有效、更有能力、更亲切、更有同情心。你将更有能力帮助他人解决生活中的简单问题和生活中的更大问题。</p>
<p>You need this immersion. You cannot study and engage in this preparation while trying to learn three or four other things that you also think are very important and then try to bring them all together. Paths go off in different directions. You cannot follow them all at once. There are many ways up the mountain, but you must follow one and stay with it. If you get onto another track, well, you don’t know where that one goes.</p>
<p>你需要这种沉浸式的学习。你不能一边学习和从事这种准备工作，一边试图学习其他三、四件你也认为非常重要的事情，然后试图把它们全部结合起来。路径会向不同的方向发展。你不能同时遵循它们。上山的路有很多条，但你必须遵循其中一条，并坚持下去。如果你上了另一条路，那么，你不知道那条路通往哪里。</p>
<p>You do not know where you are going in life, but Knowledge within you knows. Knowledge will engage you with those who are wiser and those who are less wise. And when you are ready, Knowledge will bring you to the preparation and the curriculum of study that you will need in order to advance.</p>
<p>你不知道你在生命中要去哪里，但你内心的内识知道。内识会让你与那些更聪明的人和那些不太聪明的人接触。当你准备好的时候，内识会把你带到你所需要的准备和学习课程中去，以使你进步。</p>
<p>Knowledge will lead you to those individuals who can become the real companions in your life, companions in a greater endeavor in life. These relationships transcend the personal emphasis that people give in their relationships. These are greater relationships where devotion and commitment, deeper understanding and greater validation can be found. You will need these companions because you cannot learn The Greater Community Way of Knowledge alone, for the truth is you are not alone. You must learn this truth, and it must be demonstrated to you in the most tangible ways possible.</p>
<p>内识将引导你找到那些能够成为你生命中真正的伙伴的人，在生命中更大努力中的伙伴。这些关系超越了人们在其关系中所强调的个人。这些是更大的关系，在那里可以找到奉献和承诺、更深的理解和更大的验证。你将需要这些同伴，因为你无法独自学习大社区内识之路，因为事实是你并不孤单。你必须学习这个真理，而且必须以最具体的方式向你展示。</p>
<p>Many people, however, still want to go alone. They do not want to become involved with others because they are afraid to join anything. They do not want to be around anyone who is more advanced because they do not want their limitations, their weaknesses and their false assumptions to be revealed to them. They would rather go alone, making their own decisions and having their own conclusions. How hopeless this is.</p>
<p>然而，许多人仍然想独自前进。他们不想与他人交往，因为他们害怕加入任何关系。他们不想和更高级的人在一起，因为他们不想让自己的局限性、弱点和错误的假设暴露在他们面前。他们宁愿独自行动，自己做决定，有自己的结论。这是多么无望的局面。</p>
<p>Life is bringing you back into relationship with yourself, with others, with the world and with God. How can you advance if you refuse to enter relationship, to share your understanding, to have your errors corrected and to enter into a different and greater venture that far exceeds what you alone can know and understand as an individual?</p>
<p>生命正在把你带回与自己、与他人、与世界和与上帝的关系中。如果你拒绝进入关系，拒绝分享你的理解，拒绝让你的错误得到纠正，拒绝进入一个不同的、更大的、远远超过你一个人所能知道和理解的冒险，你怎么能进步？</p>
<p>Knowledge within you requires Knowledge within others to bring about any kind of positive results in the world because Knowledge is fully revealed within the context of relationship. This is where things are known and verified. This is where things are acted upon and given meaning in the world. This is an expression of Wisdom. To think that you can learn and accomplish things on your own is not wise. You as an individual can do very little, but the truth is you are not alone, and you must learn this truth.</p>
<p>你内在的内识需要他人内在的内识，才能给世界带来任何积极的结果，因为内识是在关系的背景下充分揭示的。这就是内识被知道和验证的地方。这是关系被采取行动并在世界中被赋予意义的地方。这是智慧的一种表达。认为你可以靠自己学习和完成准备是不明智的。你作为一个人可以做的很少，但事实是你并不孤单，你必须学习这个真理。</p>
<p>Knowledge will engage you with those whom you need to be engaged with. It will bring into your life those that you need to meet. Some of them will demonstrate error to you, to help clarify things for you and to sober your mind. Others will come with the capacity to join you in your journey. There will be a greater dimension of relationship here, something you could never have found before—something that gives permanence, meaning, a deeper resonance, a greater capability and a joining of two resources of mind into the meaningful direction of relationship.</p>
<p>内识将使你与那些你需要接触的人接触。它将把那些你需要见的人带入你的生命。他们中的一些人会向你展示错误，帮助你澄清关系，使你心灵清醒。其他人会带着能力来加入你的旅程。这里将有一个更大的关系维度，是你以前从未发现的——一些赋予持久性、意义、更深的共鸣、更大的能力和两个心灵资源的结合，进入关系的有意义的方向。</p>
<p>Both in learning things in the world and in learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, you need the ability to evaluate things correctly. This must come from maturity. For example, if you are learning to play the piano, in order to evaluate yourself correctly, you must become fairly advanced in your study. You must be able to see clearly what is correct and what is not correct. This will be based largely upon your experience with an instructor who has taught you these evaluative skills. This will be based upon your own failures in performance and in practice, which have shown you where you need to improve. Eventually, you will be able to hear the errors yourself and see where the improvement needs to be made.</p>
<p>无论是在学习世界上的事物，还是在学习大社区内识之路，你都需要有正确评价事物的能力。这必须来自于成熟。例如，如果你正在学习弹钢琴，为了正确评价自己，你必须在学习中变得相当先进。你必须能够清楚地看到什么是正确的，什么是不正确的。这将主要基于你与教你这些评价技巧的老师的经历。这将基于你自己在表演和实践中的失败，这些失败让你看到你需要改进的地方。最终，你将能够自己听到错误，看到需要改进的地方。</p>
<p>Only an advancing student can develop these kinds of skills. A beginner cannot. How can beginners fully evaluate what needs to be improved in their development? They may realize that they are not doing very well. They may know that they are not very accomplished, for they are constantly coming up against their disabilities and making many gross errors. However, to refine and perfect their study requires a mature approach. Gaining a mature approach requires time and energy and will be the result of their sharing themselves with those who are more advanced who can teach them these evaluative skills and give them a greater sensitivity.</p>
<p>只有进步的学生才能发展这种技能。初学者则不能。初学者如何全面评估自己发展中需要改进的地方？他们可能意识到自己做得不是很好。他们可能知道自己的成就不高，因为他们不断地遇到自己的障碍，犯了许多严重的错误。然而，要改进和完善他们的学习，需要一个成熟的方法。获得成熟的方法需要时间和能量，这将是他们与那些更先进的人分享自己的结果，这些人可以教给他们这些评估技能，让他们有更大的敏感性。</p>
<p>Developing these skills also depends upon whom you share your study with. They will demonstrate both error and accomplishment to you in ways that you can see and understand. For example, a student of piano must listen to many other students’ attempts to play in order to gain a more critical ear and a deeper sensitivity to what is harmonious and to what is not, to what is effective and to what is not. This refines their awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>发展这些技能也取决于你与谁分享你的研究。他们会以你能看到和理解的方式向你展示错误和成就。例如，一个学钢琴的学生必须倾听许多其他学生的演奏尝试，以便获得更多的批判性的耳朵和对什么是和谐的、什么是不和谐的、什么是有效的、什么是不有效的更深的敏感性。这就提高了他们的意识和敏感性。</p>
<p>How true this is in learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. In the Greater Community, advanced races have recognized that no individual can have complete Knowledge or Wisdom. Everyone needs what is called Verication, which is a process of reviewing decisions and conclusions with Knowledge. Verication is necessary because everyone is capable of making terrible mistakes. Everyone in physical life needs this. Anyone who attempts to claim ultimate Wisdom or who thinks that they can correct themselves effectively on a consistent basis is making a grave and serious error and is demonstrating that they have not yet gained true maturity in their understanding and studenthood.</p>
<p>这在学习大社区内识之路中是多么真实。在大社区，先进的种族已经认识到，没有一个人可以拥有完整的内识或智慧。每个人都需要所谓的验证，这是一个用内识审查决定和结论的过程。验证是必要的，因为每个人都有可能犯可怕的错误。物理生活中的每个人都需要这个。任何试图宣称自己拥有终极智慧的人，或者认为自己能够持续有效地纠正自己的人，都是在犯严重的错误，表明他们在理解和学习方面还没有获得真正的成熟。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, Verication is essential for success. It both requires and develops relationships of real meaning and value. It requires that you be committed to the people who are committed to you. It requires that you be committed to Knowledge together, that you serve a greater purpose together and that you have a greater enterprise, a greater goal, together.</p>
<p>在大社区里，验证是成功的关键。它既需要也发展具有真正意义和价值的关系。它要求你对那些对你有承诺的人作出承诺。它要求你们一起致力于内识，你们一起为一个更伟大的目的服务，你们一起有一个更大的事业，一个更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>We teach this and we emphasize this because nothing great can be done alone and all errors occur because someone is acting without Knowledge. Here the quality of your companionship and your desire for truth are fundamental for your success. One bad advisor can damage or obstruct your progress and lead you astray. Choose well here. How can you choose well? Those who advance in The Way of Knowledge must be advancing in their maturity and understanding. Yet those who cannot or will not advance are doing so for personal reasons. Be aware and be careful with them.</p>
<p>我们教这个，我们强调这个，因为没有什么伟大的目的可以单独完成，所有错误的发生都是因为有人在没有内识的情况下行事。在这里，你同伴的质量和你对真理的渴望是你成功的根本。一个不好的顾问会损害或阻碍你的进步，并把你引入歧途。在这里要好好选择。如何才能选择好呢？那些在内识之路上前进的人，必须在他们的成熟度和理解力上有所进步。然而，那些不能或不愿意进步的人是出于个人原因而这样做。要注意并小心对待他们。</p>
<p>As you become more skillful, you will need a higher and higher quality of Verication. You will need stronger and stronger companions. You can give to those who are less developed than you are, but you cannot rely upon their Wisdom. Here your relationships become more and more important. That is why we say there is no mastery in the world, because when people think of mastery, they think that they can reach an end point in education where they become infallible. Here demagoguery, totalitarianism and fanaticism of all kinds bring unhappiness and misery upon people in the world.</p>
<p>随着你的技能越来越娴熟，你需要越来越高质量的验证。你需要越来越强大的同伴。你可以给予那些不如你发达的人，但你不能依赖他们的智慧。在这里，你的关系变得越来越重要。这就是为什么我们说世界上没有真正的掌握，因为当人们想到掌握时，他们认为可以在教育上达到一个终点，变得万无一失。在这里，各种形式的煽动、极权主义和狂热主义会给世界上的人们带来不幸和痛苦。</p>
<p>Your errors become more costly as you become more advanced, and you will need to be more guarded against them. Here is where you will need a community of Knowledge—a network of relationships that are able to vericate for you and bring you back to Knowledge to offset your personal conflicts, which will still be plaguing you as you advance. Here your interdependence with others will become the foundation of your relationships, and here interdependence will become fully established.</p>
<p>你的错误随着你变得更先进而变得更有代价，你将需要更多的防备它们。在这里，你将需要一个内识社区——一个能够为你验证并将你带回内识的关系网络，以抵消你的个人冲突，这些冲突将在你进步时仍然困扰着你。在这里，你与他人的相互依存将成为你关系的基础，在这里，相互依存将完全建立。</p>
<p>As a master musician needs to associate with other master musicians, you must seek to associate with those who are advanced in Knowledge, for they can vericate for you. They will be able to understand your nature and your purpose, your difficulties and your challenges, things which others will not be able to see and fully comprehend.</p>
<p>就像一个音乐大师需要与其他音乐大师交往一样，你必须寻求与那些内识先进的人交往，因为他们可以为你验证。他们将能够理解你的本性和目的，你的困难和挑战，其他人无法看到和完全理解的事情。</p>
<p>These are some things that you have already seen in your own education. Perhaps you have not fully experienced them, but if you look and see, you will understand that the correct curriculum, the correct attitude, the right instructor, the right companions and the ability to evaluate your own progress are all essential. If you have ever gone beyond a beginning level in learning anything, you have seen that there are new thresholds in learning and new requirements for learning. We call upon your experience and recognition here, but we don’t expect you to fully understand the meaning of this within the context of learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Remember, if you think that you can learn this great preparation without wise guidance, without the correct curriculum, without the right attitude, without good companions and without evaluative skills, you will be deceiving yourself.</p>
<p>这些是你在自己的教育中已经看到的一些事情。也许你还没有完全经历到它们，但如果你看一看，你就会明白，正确的课程、正确的态度、正确的导师、正确的同伴和评估自己进步的能力都是必不可少的。如果你在学习任何东西时曾经超过初级水平，你就会看到，学习中有新的门槛，对学习有新的要求。我们在这里呼吁你的经验和认识，但我们并不期望你在学习大社区内识之路的背景下完全理解其中的含义。请记住，如果你认为没有明智的指导，没有正确的课程，没有正确的态度，没有好的同伴，没有评估技能，你就可以学习这个伟大的准备，你将欺骗自己。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is not something that you learn in a weekend, or a week or a month or a year. It is not something that you can fully comprehend in a book. It is far greater. It is so much greater, and yet its greatness is what returns greatness to you. Seek to do what is easy, comfortable and familiar and you will stay right where you are, bound to the past and bound to all the deceptions that have plagued you in the past, unable to proceed, unable to advance, unable to learn and unable to accomplish what you came here to accomplish.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路不是你在一个周末，或一个星期或一个月或一年内就能学会的。它不是你在书中可以完全理解的知识。它要大得多。它是如此之大，然而它的伟大是对你的伟大的回报。寻求做容易的、舒适的和熟悉的工作，你就会停留在原地，被过去所束缚，被过去困扰你的所有欺骗所束缚，无法前进，无法进步，无法学习，无法完成你来这里要完成的工作。</p>
<p>Your calling is great because your purpose is great. Your purpose is great because your nature is great. Your nature is great because your Creator is great. Do not be discouraged, then, but allow yourself to be challenged and challenge yourself. You came here to learn. You came here to accomplish something. Why take the easy and comfortable way? That only leads to a great failure at the end of your life, a failure that will cause you much distress and unhappiness throughout your life. There is no comfort in comfort. There is no escape in escape. There is no relief in passivity. There is no luxury in luxury. Unless you can fulfill your mission and purpose here, a misery will attend you that no amount of pleasure, luxury, avoidance, comfort or passivity can allay.</p>
<p>你的召唤是伟大的，因为你的目的是伟大的。你的目的是伟大的，因为你的本性是伟大的。你的本性是伟大的，因为你的创造者是伟大的。那么，不要灰心，要允许自己受到挑战，挑战自己。你来到这里是为了学习。你来这里是为了完成一些事情。为什么要走容易和舒适的路？那只会在你生命的最后阶段导致巨大的失败，这种失败将使你在一生中遭受许多痛苦和不快。安逸中没有舒适。逃避中没有逃脱。被动中没有解脱。奢华中没有奢侈。除非你能完成你在这里的使命和目的，否则痛苦将伴随着你，无论多少快乐、奢侈、逃避、舒适或被动都无法缓解。</p>
<p>Prepare, then, with the right curriculum, the right attitude, the right instructor, the right companions and the right evaluative skills. The correct attitude is based upon your feeling your deeper need, which is necessary even at the outset. You need to learn, and your learning must take you beyond the conventions of human education, which are limited and specific. To learn something greater about life and to do something greater in life require a different kind of preparation.</p>
<p>那么，请准备好正确的课程、正确的态度、正确的指导者、正确的同伴和正确的评估技能。正确的态度是基于你对自己更深层次需求的感受，这甚至在一开始就有必要。你需要学习，而你的学习必须使你超越人类教育的惯例，这些惯例是有限的和具体的。要学习关于生命的更伟大的内识，并在生命中做更大的工作，需要一种不同的准备。</p>
<p>We have mentioned some of the things that are similar between learning things in the world and learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. How about those things that are different? The difference here is that you will enter Mystery. Here you cannot take your prior learning with you. Only a little bit of your prior experience can help you now. Here you cannot rely upon your philosophy. You cannot rely upon your sense of who you are. And you cannot rely upon your ideas or your ideals. All that you can rely upon is the remembrance of how things are learned and what is needed in learning. Here you shift your reliance from your ideas to reliance upon Knowledge itself. Ideas seem tangible. You can control them. However, Knowledge is not tangible. You cannot control it.</p>
<p>我们已经提到了学习世界上的技能和学习大社区内识之路之间的一些相似之处。那么，那些不同的事情呢？这里的区别是，你将进入神秘的世界。在这里，你不能带着你之前的学习。现在只有你以前的一点点经验可以帮助你。在这里，你不能依靠你的哲学。你不能依靠你对自己是谁的感觉。你也不能依靠你的想法或理想。你所能依赖的是对事物如何被学习以及学习中需要什么的回忆。在这里，你把你的依赖从你的想法转向对内识本身的依赖。想法似乎是有形的。你可以控制它们。然而，内识不是有形的。你无法控制它。</p>
<p>Entering the Mystery takes great faith—faith in yourself, faith in Knowledge and faith in the Greater Power of the universe that has sent you here. This faith is necessary at the outset. It is the thing that you need before real certainty can be developed and relied upon on a consistent basis. Here you learn to rely upon the Mystery and not upon tangible things. Here you ask the Mystery to give you that which you need in the tangible world rather than asking the tangible world to give you what you need to function in the world of Mystery. Here your education is very different, and your experience is very different. Instead of adding on and adding on more information, more ideas, more experiences, more methods and more conclusions, you keep opening yourself to the unknown. You keep asking Knowledge to take you into new arenas, and you do not attempt to govern or control the process.</p>
<p>进入神秘需要极大的信仰——对自己的信仰，对内识的信仰，对把你送到这里宇宙更伟大力量的信仰。这种信仰在开始时是必要的。它是你在真正的确定性能够得到发展并持续依赖之前所需要的信念。在这里，你要学会依靠神秘，而不是依靠有形的世界。在这里，你要求神秘给予你在有形世界中所需要的关系，而不是要求有形世界给予你在神秘世界中运作所需要的关系。在这里，你的教育是非常不同的，你的经历也是非常不同的。你不是不断增加更多的信息、更多的想法、更多的经历、更多的方法和更多的结论，而是不断向未知世界开放自己。你不断要求内识带你进入新的领域，而你并不试图管理或控制这个过程。</p>
<p>Your discipline here needs to be in learning to discern the way—discerning the lessons that have to be learned, discerning the relationships that you come in contact with, and discerning your own motivations as you proceed. This is a great enough requirement in and of itself. How few have been successful here. So do not ask for more, and do not expect more. When we give you a challenge, it will be quite sufficient in terms of engaging your time and energy. It will be quite sufficient in relieving you of the burdens, complaints and confusion that belittle you and keep you bound to old ideas and old ways of doing things.</p>
<p>你在这里的纪律需要学习辨别方向——辨别必须学习的课程，辨别你接触到的关系，以及辨别你前进过程中自己的动机。这本身就是一个很好的要求。在这里，有多少人成功了。所以不要要求更多，也不要期望更多。当我们给你一个挑战时，它在吸引你的时间和能量方面将是相当充分的。它将非常充分地解除你的负担、抱怨和困惑，这些负担、抱怨和困惑贬低了你，使你被旧的想法和旧的做事方式所束缚。</p>
<p>Learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge takes you to a greater certainty within you. You cannot rely upon your ideas or your conclusions, for they may be true in this moment but not true in the next. They may be applicable in this situation but not applicable in that situation. They may have served you well before, but they may be ineffective in what you are facing now. Therefore, in learning, do not rely upon previous conclusions.</p>
<p>学习大社区内识之路会使你的内心更加笃定。你不能依赖你的想法或结论，因为它们在这一刻可能是真的，但在下一刻就不会是真的了。它们可能在这种情况下适用，但在那种情况下并不适用。它们以前可能对你有好处，但对你现在面临的情况可能无效。因此，在学习中，不要依赖以前的结论。</p>
<p>Become a beginning student. Open yourself. Assume nothing. This makes you really available. This makes it possible to give you instruction. This makes it possible for you to learn from instruction. This teaches you what you must learn in order to help others in life. And you will see from your own experience as you progress that those who are full of presumptions, ideas and beliefs about themselves and life are inaccessible and ineffective in learning new things.</p>
<p>成为一名初级的学生。开放自己。什么都不假设。这使你真正可用。这使我们有可能给你指导。这使你有可能从指导中学习。这教会了你为了在生命中帮助他人而必须学习的力量。随着你的进步，你会从自己的经历中看到，那些对自己和生命充满预设、想法和信仰的人是无法接触到的，在学习新事物方面也是无效的。</p>
<p>Therefore, learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge requires courage because you must risk your ideas. You must risk your conclusions. And you must be willing to proceed even at times when you feel very uncertain about yourself or what you are doing. The Way of Knowledge takes you from one stage of certainty to a greater certainty and then on to an even greater certainty. These are all thresholds of experience. As you pass through one, you go through a period where you feel like you do not know anything. This is where new experiences and new understanding can emerge, but you must allow this to happen.</p>
<p>因此，学习大社区的内识方式需要勇气，因为你必须冒着你的想法。你必须冒着你的结论的风险。即使在你对自己或你正在做的事情感到非常不确定的时候，你也必须愿意继续前进。内识之路把你从一个确定的阶段带到一个更大的确定阶段，然后再到一个更大的确定阶段。这些都是经历的门槛。当你通过一个时，你会经历一个你觉得自己什么都不知道的时期。这时，新的经验和新的理解就会出现，但你必须允许这种情况发生。</p>
<p>It is like the farmer planting the fields. After each harvest, the field must be plowed under, and everything looks bleak and empty. There is no produce. There is no harvest. There is no evidence of any bounty. Everything must be replanted and started all over again so that next year there may be new and different harvests, and life may continue.</p>
<p>这就像农民种田一样。每次收获之后，田地必须重新翻耕，一切看起来荒凉而空旷。没有农作物，没有收获，没有任何丰收的迹象。一切必须重新播种和开始，这样明年才能有新的和不同的收成，生活才能继续。</p>
<p>This is how it will be in your education in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Instead of accumulation, there will be release and freedom. Education that only accumulates ideas, beliefs and experiences gluts the mind and prevents it from learning new things. An education in Knowledge, however, keeps opening your mind. It is as if you were going from a smaller room of understanding into a greater room of understanding, and from that great room of understanding into an even greater room of understanding. As you pass from the familiar environment of your current understanding into a greater context, you will feel like you do not know anything. You have not yet defined yourself within this greater context. You do not yet understand its dimensions. And you do not know what awaits you there.</p>
<p>这就是你在大社区内识之路中的教育方式。与其说是积累，不如说是释放和自由。只积累想法、信仰和经验的教育使人头脑发热，无法学习新东西。然而，内识的教育会不断地打开你的心灵。就好像你从一个较小的理解室进入一个更大的理解室，又从这个大的理解室进入一个更大的理解室。当你从你目前理解的熟悉环境进入一个更大的环境时，你会觉得你什么都不知道。你还没有在这个更大的背景下定义自己。你还不知道它的尺寸。你也不知道那里有什么在等着你。</p>
<p>It is openness, courage and greater motivation in learning that will carry you through. Here you will find a great truth in life: Only Knowledge can take you to Knowledge, and only Wisdom can take you to Wisdom. Your personal reasons for following The Greater Community Way of Knowledge will run out when you see that it will not give you more money, more love or greater advantages in life—advantages that you define in terms of your own personal goals. Here you will have to choose again, and what will enable you to keep going is Knowledge itself. Then you will see that your former goals were small and selfish and could never satisfy you. Yet you can only see this as you advance and become mature in your evaluative abilities. When you have become honest and objective with yourself, then you will have reached a state of maturity in your evaluation. This is a great accomplishment in and of itself and will take a long time to achieve. However, its rewards are so great, so valuable and so lasting that there is nothing else in the world that can compare with it.</p>
<p>是开放、勇气和更大的学习动力将带你度过难关。在这里，你会发现生命中的一个伟大真理。只有内识能带你走向内识，只有智慧能带你走向智慧。当你发现遵循大社区内识之路不会给你带来更多的钱、更多的爱或更大的生活优势时，你的个人理由就会用完，这些优势是你根据自己的个人目标定义的。在这里，你将不得不重新选择，而能让你继续前进的是内识本身。然后你会看到，你以前的目标是小而自私的，永远无法满足你。然而，你只有在你进步并在评估能力方面变得成熟时才能看到这一点。当你对自己变得诚实和客观时，你的评价就会达到一个成熟的状态。这本身就是一项伟大的成就，需要很长的时间来实现。然而，它的回报是如此之大，如此有价值，如此持久，世界上没有任何东西可以与之相比。</p>
<p>You have before you a mysterious preparation. However, like all forms of education, it requires certain fundamental things. Here you can call upon your previous experience to remind yourself of what is essential, what you must choose and what you must accept as a student. Beyond this, however, you are entering into a new realm. Only a Greater Community Way of Knowledge can teach you Greater Community Spirituality. Here you must be willing to go beyond the boundaries of human thinking, human beliefs and human assumptions. Here you will enter into a new and greater arena of learning in life where your previous assumptions and beliefs do not hold and do not fit. You must leave them at the door before entering a greater room, a greater context and a greater experience.</p>
<p>你面前有一个神秘的准备。然而，像所有形式的教育一样，它需要某些基本的东西。在这里，你可以调用你以前的经历来提醒自己什么是基本的，什么是你必须选择的，什么是你作为一个学生必须接受的。然而，除此之外，你将进入一个新的领域。只有大社区内识之路才能教你大社区精神性。在这里，你必须愿意超越人类思维、人类信仰和人类假设的界限。在这里，你将进入一个新的、更大的生命学习领域，你以前的假设和信仰不成立，不适合。在进入一个更大的房间、更大的背景和更大的经历之前，你必须把它们留在门口。</p>
<p>It is the ability to be empty and open and to cast away ideas that you have relied upon that will enable you to truly advance and become a light in the world, a light that can shine ever more brightly. What are ideas but expedient things that have temporary value? What are beliefs but things that can help you see and function better in life as it is occurring now? Yet these things must be changeable, or they will prevent you from being open to life and will work against you once their usefulness is over. Like a set of clothes, they wear out and you must have new garments, and these garments must be appropriate for the conditions that you are facing and for your experience of yourself. Do not look at your garments and say, “This is who I am. I am how I dress.” Do not do that. Likewise, do not look at your ideas and beliefs and say, “This is who I am because this is what I believe. This is who I am because this is what I think.” Your thoughts will change and will need to change. Allow them to change. They are temporary expedients. They are like prescription glasses that help you see, yet as your vision changes, you will need to get a new prescription. If you don’t, your ability to see will decline, and you will become ever more blind to the world.</p>
<p>正是空无和开放的能力，以及抛弃你所依赖的想法的能力，将使你能够真正进步，成为世界上的一盏灯，一盏能够更加闪亮的灯。想法是什么，不过是有暂时价值的权宜之计？信仰是什么，不过是帮助你在当下的生命中更好地看清和运作的工具？然而，这些想法必须是可以改变的，否则它们会妨碍你对生命的开放，一旦它们的作用结束，就会对你不利。就像一套衣服，它们磨损了，你必须有新的衣服，而这些衣服必须适合你所面临的条件和你对自己的经历。不要看着你的衣服，说：”这就是我是谁。我就是我的穿着”。不要那样做。同样地，不要看你的想法和信仰，说：”这就是我，因为这是我的信仰。这就是我，因为这是我的想法”。你的想法会改变，需要改变。允许它们改变。它们是暂时的权宜之计。它们就像帮助你看清世界的眼镜，然而随着你的视力变化，你将需要得到一个新的处方。如果你不这样做，你的视力将下降，你将变得对世界越来越盲目。</p>
<p>What is permanent within you is Knowledge. Your intellect is a vehicle for Knowledge. It is temporary. Knowledge is the permanent and the immortal part of you. To find a permanent life, you must venture beyond your temporary life. To find a permanent intelligence, you must be willing to pass through your temporary intelligence. Accept what is permanent and what is temporary here. This will give you great freedom and flexibility in life. It will enable greater things to be learned because your mind will be growing in its scope and capacity, your desire for education will be growing, and you will be a person who is fresh and young at heart instead of old and defensive.</p>
<p>你内在的永恒之物是内识。你的智力是内识的载体，它是暂时的。内识是你永恒和不朽的部分。要找到一个永恒的生命，你必须冒险超越你暂时的生命。要找到永恒的智能，你必须愿意穿过你暂时的智能。接受这里什么是永恒的，什么是暂时的。这将在生命中给你极大的自由和灵活性。它将使你能够学习更伟大的内识，因为你的心智将在其范围和能力上不断增长，你对教育的渴望将不断增强，你将成为一个内心新鲜和年轻的人，而不是一个老旧和防御性强的人。</p>
<p>All these things are part of your preparation. Use what you have learned, but let your ideas and conclusions be flexible. Let your understanding of yourself be flexible, for it will most assuredly change and expand as you advance in learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Your sense of yourself will go from being a member of your family to being a member of your community or network of friends to being a member of the world and finally to being a member of the Greater Community. What a tremendous expansion this is and what a greater vantage point in life this will give you. How far you will be able to see then. How much you will be able to know. And how great will be your assistance to others who seek to learn and to know. You cannot fulfill your purpose as you are now. You cannot understand your nature as you are now. You cannot see the world as you are now. And you cannot discern your relationships as you are now. To do these you need a greater vantage point. You need to be far above where you are now so that you can look down and really see the lay of the land.</p>
<p>所有这些事情都是你准备的一部分。使用你所学到的准备，但让你的想法和结论具有灵活性。让你对自己的理解具有灵活性，因为随着你在学习大社区内识方式方面的进展，它肯定会改变和扩大。你对自己的认识将从家庭的成员变成社区或朋友网络的成员，变成世界的成员，最后变成大社区的成员。这是一个多么巨大的扩展，这将给你带来多么大的生活优势。那时你将能看到多远。你将能知道多少。你对其他寻求学习和了解的人的帮助将是多么巨大。你不能像现在这样实现你的目的。你不能像现在这样理解你的本性。你不能像现在这样看到这个世界。你也不能像现在这样辨别你的关系。要做到这些，你需要一个更大的观测点。你需要远远高于你现在所处的位置，这样你才能向下看，真正看到土地的布局。</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer to your desire for truth, honesty, resolution, peace and accomplishment—however you may wish to express and define it—must be a means for you to reach a greater vantage point in life. You cannot stay where you are and simply have answers or good ideas. You must move to a different position in life. You must have a greater intelligence within you. You must have a deeper point of reference, a deeper awareness within yourself. Using the analogy of the mountain, you must climb above where you are now to look and see where you are and to understand your situation. Then you will be able to move forward.</p>
<p>因此，你对真理、诚实、决心、和平和成就的渴望的答案——无论你想如何表达和定义它——必须是你在生命中达到更大有利位置的一种手段。你不能停留在你所处的位置，只是拥有答案或好主意。你必须移动到生命中的不同位置。你必须在你的内心有更大的智能。你必须有一个更深的参照点，在你的内心有一个更深的意识。用山的比喻，你必须爬到你现在所在的地方之上，看一看，看看你在哪里，了解你的情况。然后你将能够向前迈进。</p>
<p>To advance, you cannot stay at the bottom of the mountain and fantasize how it will be and imagine yourself going up and being at the top. The experience will always be different from imagination. The experience will be its own initiation. Stay at the bottom of the mountain and you will never know the mountain. Stay in your thoughts and your ideas, and you will never understand what real purpose, meaning and direction in life are. Protect your ideas, and they will hold you where you are, but Knowledge will take you beyond your ideas to a greater understanding, a greater vantage point and into a greater arena of life.</p>
<p>要想前进，你不能停留在山脚下，幻想它将是怎样的，并想象自己已经上山，站在山顶。体验将总是与想象不同。体验将是它自己的开始。呆在山脚下，你就永远不会知道山的存在。留在你的思想和想法中，你将永远不明白什么是真正的目的、意义和人生方向。保护你的想法，它们会让你停留在原地，但内识会带你超越你的想法，进入一个更大的理解，一个更大的观测位置，进入一个更大的生命舞台。</p>
<p>We offer the path to the Greater Community. You are able to learn this, and you can understand this even being a citizen of your world. You do not need to travel about the universe, for there are indeed many races who do travel about the universe, but they have not learned The Way of Knowledge. They see, but they do not know. And they are prone to the same errors as you are, even though their comprehension of the universe is greater and their technology and methods of transport are more advanced. We are speaking of something that will give you an advantage in your life in the world and an advantage even in the Greater Community. In the Greater Community technology is not the prize. Power is not the prize. Advantage is not the prize. Domination is not the prize. The prize is Knowledge and Wisdom. This is fulfillment. And this is what you need in the world right now.</p>
<p>我们提供通向大社区的道路。你能够学习这一点，即使是作为你们世界的公民，你也能理解这一点。你不需要在宇宙中旅行，因为确实有许多种族在宇宙中旅行，但他们没有学会内识之路。他们看到了，但他们不知道。他们很容易犯和你们一样的错误，尽管他们对宇宙的理解力更强，他们的技术和运输方法更先进。我们所说的内识将使你在世界的生命中具有优势，甚至在大社区中也具有优势。在大社区，技术不是奖品。力量不是奖品。优势不是奖赏。主宰不是奖赏。奖品是内识和智慧。这就是成就。这就是你现在在这个世界上所需要的。</p>
