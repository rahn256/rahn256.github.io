<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 31, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年1月31日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In life, people see what they can see based upon their vantage point and based upon what colors their perception. Clearly, if you reach a higher vantage point on the mountain of life, you are able to see more. You are able to see things you simply could not see before because you did not have the position from which to look. Previously, you could believe anything, but you could not see.</p>
<p>在生命中，人们看到的事情取决于他们所处的观测位置，取决于他们感知到的事情。显然，如果你站在生命之山的更高处，你就能看到更多。你能看到以前根本看不见的事情，因为你没有合适的位置去观察。之前，你或许可以相信任何事情，但你却无法看见。</p>
<p>The important thing here is to reach the vantage point where you can see for yourself. You can see and know clearly. Using the analogy of the mountain, you could stay down below in the woods and cultivate any point of view you want, but you cannot yet see where you stand. You cannot see your position on the mountain. You cannot see what surrounds the mountain. You cannot see how great the mountain is. And you cannot see how far along you are.</p>
<p>这里最重要的是要达到一个你可以亲眼看见的观测位置。你可以看得清清楚楚，知道得清清楚楚。用山来比喻，你可以待在山下的树林里，培养任何你想要的观点，但你还看不到你站在哪里。你看不到你在山上的位置。你看不到山的周围。你看不到山有多大。你也看不到你走了多远。</p>
<p>This is why the idea of mastery is so relative. You may say, “Well, I am a master! I am so far beyond, so far above where I was before!” But then finally you turn and look, and you see that the path keeps going, and you have to move along, for your journey is not done yet. So each thing you master sets a new beginning. Each thing you complete establishes a new beginning.</p>
<p>这就是为什么大师这个概念是如此相对。你可能会说：“好吧，我是一个大师！我远远超越了，远远超过了我以前所处的位置！”但最后你转过身来，你发现这条道路还在继续，你必须继续前行，因为你的旅程还没有结束。所以你掌握的每件事都是一个新的开始。你完成的每件事都建立了一个新的开始。</p>
<p>It would not be enough for Us to provide all of the insight, perspective and information that We are presenting in this book if We were not prepared to take you to that vantage point from which you could see. Our intention is not simply to give you a wonderful and grand perception of life, a grand idea, a bigger belief system, a whole new set of ideas to adhere to and to identify with. That would only compound your problem and increase your burden.</p>
<p>如果我们不准备带你到你能看到的观测位置，那么我们在这本书中提供的所有见解、观点和信息都是不够的。我们的目的不仅仅是给你一个美好而伟大的人生观、一个伟大的想法、一个更大的信仰体系、一整套值得你坚持和认同的新想法。那只会使你的问题复杂化并增加你的负担。</p>
<p>Instead, We are telling you that you can see and know what must be seen and known if you reach the vantage point from which you can see and thus know. From a higher vantage point, things are simply obvious, but until you reach this vantage point, you must consider them as possibilities.</p>
<p>相反，我们告诉你，如果你达到了能够看见并因此知道的观测点，你就能够看见和知道必须看见和知道的事情。从更高的观测点来看，事情是显而易见的，但在你达到这个观测点之前，你必须将它们视为可能性。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you knows what it knows already. The closer you become to Knowledge, the more you will know what Knowledge knows. But you still must make the journey to see with your own eyes the real circumstances of your life and the greater circumstances that are affecting the course and destiny of humanity.</p>
<p>你内在的内识知道它已经知道的事情。你越接近内识，你就越知道内识知道的事情。但你仍必须踏上旅程，用你自己的眼睛看清你生命的真实境况以及影响人类进程和天命的更大境况。</p>
<p>This brings Us now to discuss developing a Greater Community perspective and understanding. Here We are not advocating that you have an alien point of view, but simply that your eyes can learn to see in a larger way and that you can learn to think in a larger way and that your perception and experience can be more encompassing and more authentic.</p>
<p>这就引出了我们现在要讨论的发展大社区的视角和理解。我们在此并非主张你拥有一种外来的观点，而只是主张你的眼睛能够学会以更广阔的方式去看，你能够学会以更广阔的方式去思考，你的感知和体验能够更加包罗万象、更加真实。</p>
<p>An alien viewpoint may be just as jaded as a human viewpoint. In fact, human beings at present are actually more free to form their own personal opinions than most advanced technological races in the Greater Community are today. Shocking but true. This offers humanity one of its few but important advantages.</p>
<p>一种外星的观点可能和人类的观点一样陈腐。事实上，与当今大社区中大多数先进技术种族相比，当今人类实际上更自由地形成了人类自己的个人观点。令人震惊但却是事实。这为人类提供了少数但重要的优势之一。</p>
<p>Developing a Greater Community perspective and understanding is the result of being able to see beyond your cultural and religious conditioning, to see beyond the prevailing attitudes and beliefs that have shaped your approach to life and your perspective, to rise beyond these, to see things in a bigger way from a higher vantage point.</p>
<p>发展一种大社区的视角和理解，是能够超越你的文化和宗教条件的结果，是能够超越塑造你的生命方式和观点的主流态度和信仰的结果，是能够超越这些的结果，是能够从更高的视角以更广阔的视角看待事物的结果。</p>
<p>You are still seeing with your own eyes. You are still relying upon your great human endowments. You have not become something else. You have become more of what you really are.</p>
<p>你仍在用你自己的眼睛观察。你仍在依靠你自己伟大的人类禀赋。你并没有变成其他人。你只是变得更像真正的自己了。</p>
<p>So what is developing a Greater Community perspective and understanding? First, it is the ability to look beyond the mass of conditioning that clouds your vision and that creates a wall around your experience. The ability to do this is the result of preparing in The Way of Knowledge. It is not something that you simply can will for yourself or hope to happen or expect to be given you by a Divine messenger. It is something you must build and cultivate within yourself, day in and day out, every day. This is how you build the foundation.</p>
<p>因此，什么是发展大社区视角和理解呢？首先，它是超越遮蔽你的视野、在你的体验周围筑起一道墙的大量制约的能力。做到这一点的能力是在内识之路上做好准备的结果。它不是你能简单地为你自己意愿、希望发生或期待神圣信使赐予你的东西。它是你必须在你自己内心日复一日、日复一日地构建和培育的事情。这就是你构建基础的方式。</p>
<p>This is how you get up the mountain. You do not get up the mountain by sitting by the side of the road and dreaming and pondering how it must be and may be and could be for you. You pick yourself up and you start moving. You take the journey step by step. And you deal with everything you encounter along the way, which teaches you how to travel, teaches you what to take with you and helps refine your perception and your ability to move forward.</p>
<p>这就是你如何攀登这座山。你不是坐在路边梦想和思考对你来说应该如何、可能如何和可以如何，这样你才能爬上山顶。你要振作起来，开始行动。你一步一步地踏上旅程。你要处理沿途遇到的一切，这会教会你如何旅行，教会你该带些什么，并帮助你完善你的感知力和前进的能力。</p>
<p>Here it is not simply that you have gotten to a higher vantage point and you can see more. You have actually gone through a real transformation in the journey itself.</p>
<p>在这里，你不仅仅是站在了一个更高的制高点，看到了更多。实际上，你在旅程中经历了真正的转变。</p>
<p>So by the time that you reach the vantage point on the mountain from which you can see, your perception is refined, and your values are now more in harmony with your true nature. You have been able to let go of things that only burdened and confused you before. You are traveling light. You are swift of foot. You know now how to negotiate the difficult changes in the path itself. You know how to deal with danger and adversity and opposition, both within yourself and outside of you.</p>
<p>因此，当你到达山上可以俯瞰的观测位置时，你的感知力已经得到提升，你的价值观也与你的自然更加和谐。你已经能够放下以前只会给你带来负担和困惑的事物。你轻装上阵。你的脚步轻快。你现在知道如何应对道路上的艰难变化。你知道如何应对危险、逆境和反对，无论是在你自己的内在还是外部。</p>
<p>Then when you are finally in the clear and can see beyond the treetops from a higher vantage point, your vision has been refined, your abilities have been heightened, and your life has become light and focused. It is the journey, then, that prepares you for what you will see when you reach the vantage point.</p>
<p>然后，当你最终清醒过来，可以从更高的观测位置看到树梢之外的风景时，你的视野就会更加开阔，你的能力也得到了提升，你的生命也变得轻松而专注。正是这段旅程让你为到达观测位置时将要看到的一切做好准备。</p>
<p>Having a Greater Community perspective in many ways is like being able to stand outside your world and look in. It is being able to stand outside yourself and look in—not with alien eyes but with your own eyes.</p>
<p>在许多方面，拥有大社区视角就像能够站在你的世界之外向内看。它是能够站在你自己之外并向内看——不是用外星的眼光，而是用你自己的眼光。</p>
<p>As it stands now, people are within the world looking out. They are inside themselves looking out, looking through all the filters that have been created through their years and years of social conditioning. And they only see very little of what is happening. They see what they prefer to see or what they have been taught to see. And often they do not even see with their own eyes, but with the eyes that have been given to them.</p>
<p>就目前情况而言，人们在世界之内向外看。他们在他们自己的内在向外看，透过他们多年社会条件所创造的所有过滤器看。他们只看到很少正在发生的事情。他们看到他们喜欢看的事情或他们被教导要看到的事情。而且他们往往甚至不是用他们自己的眼睛去看，而是用被赋予的眼睛去看。</p>
<p>If you could be outside your world looking in from a Greater Community perspective, you would see things now that are so obvious that you could not see before. You would see how small and fragile your world is, how vulnerable it is to outside intervention. You would see humanity living on the surface, visible to the discerning eye. You would see how humanity’s endeavors, priorities and conflicts are all in full display for the discreet observer. You would see that your mind is unprotected from unwarranted intervention. You would see that humanity is swayed like the wind sways the grass by forces that humanity is not even aware of.</p>
<p>如果你能站在世界之外，以大社区的视角来观察，你现在就会看到以前无法看到的显而易见的事情。你会看到你的世界是多么渺小和脆弱，它是多么容易受到外界干预的伤害。你会看到人类生活在表面，为敏锐的眼光所见。你会看到人类的事业、优先事项和冲突如何全都展现在谨慎的观察者面前。你会看到你们的心灵没有受到保护，无法免受不必要的干预。你会看到人类被人类甚至没有察觉到的力量所左右，就像风吹草动一样。</p>
<p>You would look into the world and you would see such tremendous promise in humanity and yet such grave vulnerability and irresponsibility. And you would see that humanity’s future cannot simply be based upon the saintly endeavors of a few inspired individuals, but must rely upon a greater education being furthered here and preparation for a new life and a new existence.</p>
<p>放眼世界，你会看到人类有着如此巨大的承诺，但同时也存在着如此严重的脆弱性和不负责任。你会看到，人类的未来不能仅仅依靠少数受到启发的人的圣人之举，而必须依靠一种更伟大的教育，为新的生命和新的生存做好准备。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside your world looking in, you would see how fragile the environment is, and you would see the enormous effects of its degradation. And you would see that there is very little left for humanity to exploit. You would see the enormity of the problem in all of its manifestations.</p>
<p>如果你能站在外面看一看，你就会发现环境是多么脆弱，你会看到环境恶化带来的巨大影响。你会看到人类所能利用的资源已经所剩无几。你会看到问题在所有表现形式中的严重性。</p>
<p>But from the inside looking out, do you see these things? You do not see these things. From the inside looking out, you do not know these things. You only hear and see what is told to you or what you might find yourself firsthand. You cannot see the bigger picture until you have the eyes to see and the heart to feel them.</p>
<p>但从内向外看，你能看到这些事情吗？你看不到这些事情。从内部向外看，你不知道这些事情。你只能听到和看到他人告诉你的事情，或者你自己可能亲身发现的事情。除非你有眼睛去看，有心去感受，否则你无法看到更大的全景。</p>
<p>Remember, you are not here for yourself alone. You are here for all of life. And for this, you must have an experience of this—an experience that you can relate to and that you can utilize to give yourself greater strength and motivation.</p>
<p>记住，你来到这里不只是为了你自己。你来到这里是为了所有生命。为此，你必须拥有这样的经验——一种你可以理解并可以善用的经验，来给予你自己更伟大的力量和动力。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside your world looking in, you would see that you are being scrutinized by several different groups of visitors and that many establishments have been made in the world already and that humanity, as it goes about its daily affairs, is unaware of these greater events, is day by day losing ground and losing its own influence and self-determination. Subtle yet pervasive is this influence.</p>
<p>如果你能站在世界之外往里看，你就会看到你们正受到几组不同的来访者的审视，世界上已经建立起了许多机构，而人类在处理日常事务时，并没有意识到这些更大的事件，正在一天天地失去立足之地，失去它自己的影响力和自决权。这种影响是微妙而普遍的。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside your world looking in, you would see that it is a tiny place within a far greater community, a Greater Community where life exists and has evolved and represents life in all of its manifestations. You would see that your planet is a garden planet, a relative paradise compared to other inhabited worlds. And you would see that you are living with riches beyond compare but without any real appreciation of how valuable they really are.</p>
<p>如果你能站在世界之外往里看，你会看到，这是一个更大的社区中的一个小地方，这个更大的社区里有生命存在、进化，并代表着生命的所有表现形式。你会看到，你的星球是一个花园星球，与其他有种族居住的世界相比，它是一个相对的天堂。你会看到，你们生活在无与伦比的财富中，但却没有真正意识到它们到底有多么宝贵。</p>
<p>If you could travel to other worlds that are inhabited, you would see how desolate many of them are, and you would see how many of their natural environments have been destroyed. For most worlds in the Greater Community that are inhabited have been colonized.</p>
<p>如果你能前往其他种族居住的世界，你会看到其中许多世界有多么荒凉，你会看到它们有多少自然环境已被破坏。因为大社区中大多数有生命居住的世界都已被殖民。</p>
<p>Then you would return to your world, and you would see it is a gem in the universe. You would say, “My God! What a precious place! We must care for this. Others in the Greater Community will want this for themselves. And if they see that we are neglecting its preservation, they will feel emboldened and privileged to take it for themselves.”</p>
<p>然后你就会回到你的世界，你会看到它是宇宙中的一颗宝石。你会说：“我的天哪！多么珍贵的地方！我们必须照顾它。大社区里的其他种族也会想拥有它。如果他们看到我们忽视了对它的保护，他们会感到有勇气和荣幸去把它据为己有。”</p>
<p>If you could stand outside your world looking in, you would see that life is very different from what people believe in. You would see that the Creator is at work everywhere in the universe and is not preoccupied with human affairs and aspirations. You would see that your world is but another of many, many evolving worlds. It is in fact one of many worlds that are now in the process of emerging into the Greater Community. You would see the greater risks involved, and you would see that the human population is ignorant of its condition. And you would feel compelled to act, to educate people and to provide the perception that you have and the understanding that you have gained.</p>
<p>如果你能站在世界之外往里看，你会看到生命与人们所相信的截然不同。你会看到造物主在宇宙的每一个角落工作，并不专注于人类的事务和抱负。你会看到你的世界不过是许许多多不断发展的世界中的一个。它实际上只是现在正在迈入大社区的众多世界中的一个。你会看到其中涉及的更大风险，你会看到人类民众对其状况一无所知。你会感到被迫采取行动，教育人们并提供你所拥有的感知和你所获得的理解。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside yourself and look in, you would be able to take an honest and fair appraisal of your strengths and weaknesses. And you would see how much you need to become strong with Knowledge, how much you need to find Knowledge and discern it from the other prevailing motivations in your mind. You would see how you would need to define and develop your own mental environment and clarify your relationships with others and devote yourself only to those people with whom you share a greater purpose and meaning in life.</p>
<p>如果你能够站在你自己之外，向内看，你将能够诚实、公正地评估你的优势和弱点。你将看到你多么需要拥有强大的内识，你多么需要发现内识，并辨别它与你心灵中其他主流动机的区别。你将看到你如何需要定义和发展你自己的心理环境，澄清你与他人的关系，并只把你自己奉献给那些与你共享更伟大生命目的和意义的人。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside yourself, you would see that Knowledge lives within you and is waiting to emerge and that you are struggling to allow this emergence to occur.</p>
<p>如果你能跳出你自己，你就会看到，内识生活在你的内心，等待着浮现，而你正在努力让这种浮现发生。</p>
<p>If you could stand outside yourself looking in, really, not as you look as another person, but as you yourself from the outside looking at you, you would see how much your thoughts and your activities are influenced by the prevailing attitudes, beliefs and manipulations of others. You would see how rare it is when you have original thoughts and how difficult it is to achieve a state of clarity within a sea of influence in the mental environment.</p>
<p>如果你能站在你自己的外部，真正地向内看，不是以另一个人的视角，而是以你自己的外部视角来看待你自己，你就会发现你的思想和活动在多大程度上受到了他人的主流态度、信仰和操纵的影响。你会看到，拥有原创思想是多么罕见，在心理环境的海洋影响下实现清晰状态是多么困难。</p>
<p>Gaining a Greater Community perspective and understanding is like standing outside the world and looking in, and it is like standing outside yourself and looking in—not critically, not fearfully, not hopefully, but with clear eyes, real discernment, with the strength of Knowledge, which can see clearly and know what is real from what is not, and can tell what is genuine from what is not, and can separate what is valuable from what is not.</p>
<p>获得一种大社区视角和理解，就像站在世界之外向内看，就像站在你自己之外向内看——不批判地、不恐惧地、不抱希望地，而是带着清澈的目光、真正的辨识力、带着内识的力量，它能够清晰地看清并知道什么是真实的，什么不是真实的，能够分辨什么是真诚的，什么不是真诚的，能够区分什么是有价值的，什么不是有价值的。</p>
<p>Enough people in the world need to cultivate this perspective. It will be the result of their preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. It will be the result of their having the courage and the integrity to learn about life beyond their personal sphere and to gain a greater understanding about the course and destiny of human life. It will be the result of their Greater Community education. It will be the result of taking the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>世界上有足够多的人需要培养这种视角。这将是他们在大社区内识之路上做好准备的结果。这将是他们有勇气和完整性去学习个人领域之外的生命，并获得对人类生命历程和天命的一种更伟大理解的结果。这将是他们接受大社区教育的结果。这将是开展内识进阶的结果。</p>
<p>You may think that anyone who lives in the Greater Community has a Greater Community perspective. This, of course, is not true because many races are as isolated as you are. But even amongst those who are involved in trade and commerce, who travel, for instance, they are aware that intelligent life exists [beyond them] and that they are not the center of the universe. They have been able to outgrow their tribal mentality sufficiently to be able to deal with other races in a productive way.</p>
<p>你可能认为，任何生活在大社区的生命都拥有大社区的视角。当然，事实并非如此，因为许多种族和你们一样孤立。但即使在那些从事贸易和商业、旅行的种族当中，他们也察觉到智能生命存在于[他们之外]，他们不是宇宙的中心。他们已经能够充分超越他们的部落心态，从而能够以富有成效的方式与其他种族打交道。</p>
<p>But they do not have a Greater Community perspective in the sense that they are not yet strong with Knowledge. If they are not yet strong with Knowledge, they will not have this comprehension that We are speaking of. They will be dominated by their own concerns and interests. And if they are a highly unified and structured society, these individuals will not be able to think freely for themselves.</p>
<p>但他们并不具备大社区的视角，因为他们的内识还不够强大。如果他们的内识还不够强大，他们就不会拥有我们所说的这种理解。他们将被他们自己的担忧和利益所主导。如果他们是一个高度统一和结构化的社会，这些个体将无法自由地为他们自己思考。</p>
<p>As We have said, human beings enjoy a greater personal privilege—freedom—in the world today overall than you would find in most places in the Greater Community. Humanity is not unified, and that is a great problem. But despite the many problems that this does generate, there is still relative freedom to think and to perceive. Though your education does condition you and guide you, though influences do wall you in and prevent your full perception of your situation and your abilities, the opportunities are still there.</p>
<p>正如我们所说的，人类在当今世界享有的个人特权——自由——总体上比在大社区的大多数地方都要多。人类并不团结，这是一个大问题。但是，尽管由此产生了许多问题，人们依然拥有相对的思考和感知自由。尽管你的教育确实制约着你、引导着你，尽管影响确实将你束缚住、阻碍你充分感知你的处境和你的能力，但机会依然存在。</p>
<p>Here you come to understand a very important thing—that those individuals in communities in the Greater Community who have been able to learn The Way of Knowledge, to develop skill in Knowledge and are living life according to Knowledge, have had to do so under far greater duress than most people in the world face today. That is why your opportunity is so great. We may emphasize the great need of the time, but We must also emphasize your great freedom and opportunity to seize this need, to meet this need and to prepare accordingly.</p>
<p>在这里，你理解到一件非常重要的事情——大社区社区里那些能够学习内识之路、发展内识技能并按照内识生活着的个体，他们所承受的压力远比当今世界上大多数人所面临的压力大。正因为如此，你的机会才如此伟大。我们可能会强调时代的伟大需求，但我们也必须强调你抓住这个需求、满足这个需求并进行相应准备的伟大自由和伟大机会。</p>
<p>In other worlds, races have had to prepare in The Way of Knowledge under tremendous oppression, under grave difficulties. They do not have the freedom of expression that you have today. In societies where there is skill in leading and manipulating the mental environment, this challenge becomes even more difficult, for the skill required to be a Being of Knowledge is even greater, and the skill it takes to create insulation for yourself and to have the freedom to create your own mental environment is far greater than what you as a human being face today.</p>
<p>在其他世界，种族不得不在巨大的压迫和巨大的困难下为内识之路做准备。他们没有你今天所拥有的表达自由。在拥有领导和操控心理环境技能的社会中，这个挑战变得更加困难，因为成为内识存在所需的技能甚至更大，为你自己创造隔离并拥有创造你自己心理环境的自由所需的技能远比你今天作为人类所面临的技能更大。</p>
<p>Though life may seem hard in the world and problematic, it is still relatively easy compared to life in other worlds. Look at your environment. You have almost a luxurious environment compared to environments that exist in other worlds. This is what in part makes your world so attractive. You are sitting on a little piece of luxurious living, and you do not even know what you have.</p>
<p>尽管这个世界的生命似乎很艰难，问题重重，但与其他世界的生命相比，它仍然相对容易。看看你们的环境。与其他世界相比，你们的环境几乎是奢华的。这在一定程度上使你们的世界如此有吸引力。你们坐拥一小块奢华的生活空间，却不知道你们拥有什么。</p>
<p>While it is hoped within human culture that life in other worlds will be far better than it is in your world, the truth is that this is not the case. There are other worlds as beautiful as yours, but they are rare. It is technology that has enabled races in the Greater Community to establish settlements in many worlds under adverse conditions, but environments as beautiful as yours are very rare.</p>
<p>虽然人类文化希望其他世界的生命会比你们的世界好得多，但事实并非如此。有其他世界和你们的世界一样美丽，但它们很少见。正是技术让大社区的种族能够在许多恶劣条件下建立定居点，但像你们一样美丽的环境是非常罕见的。</p>
<p>Gaining this greater vantage point and taking the journey that enables you to see and to know is the great opportunity that is placed before you now. You need this perception for yourself, and you need it for your world.</p>
<p>获得这个更伟大的视角，踏上能够让你看到和知道的旅程，是现在摆在你面前的伟大机会。你需要这种视角，为了你自己，你需要它，为了你的世界。</p>
<p>If you are not content with the little things of life—the little preoccupations, the little concerns—if you are not content to think the way everyone else is conditioned to think, if you are willing to go beyond the illusion of security that these preoccupations seem to create, then you need this Greater Community perspective and understanding because this represents the true context for coming to terms with your life and for expressing yourself wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>如果你不满足于生命中的琐事——小小的专注、小小的担忧——如果你不满足于其他人被条件的思考方式，如果你愿意超越这些专注似乎造成的安全感幻觉，那么你需要这种大社区视角和理解，因为这代表着面对你的生命、全心全意表达你自己的真实背景。</p>
<p>How do you develop such a perspective and understanding? It is the result of learning Greater Community Spirituality. It is the result of taking the Steps to Knowledge. It is the result of developing your own mental environment. It is the result of developing strong relationships that can express the reality and purpose of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你如何发展这样的视野和理解？这是学习大社区精神性的结果。这是开展内识进阶的结果。这是发展你自己心理环境的结果。这是发展能够表达内识现实和目的的强大关系的结果。</p>
<p>These are the fundamental areas of study. These are the fundamental areas of development. And a preparation for achieving them is provided in the great book, Steps to Knowledge, which is part of the Teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>这些是学习的基本领域。这些是发展的基本领域。而实现这些的准备在《内识进阶》这本伟大的著作中提供，它是大社区内识之路教程的一部分。</p>
<p>Here you develop slowly and carefully the ability to see without preference, the ability to distinguish the presence of Knowledge within you. Here you cultivate stillness of mind so that the mind becomes more of a window rather than a door. You develop a penetrating insight and highly skillful scrutiny.</p>
<p>在这里，你慢慢地、小心地发展出不带任何偏好地看待事物的能力，发展出辨别内在内识的能力。在这里，你培养心灵的静止，这样心灵就更像是一扇窗户，而不是一扇门。你发展出一种敏锐的洞察力和高度熟练的审视技能。</p>
<p>Here you learn to see yourself honestly and fairly, assessing your weaknesses and your strengths, correcting the former and embellishing the latter. You do this without a great set of formal beliefs, without heroes, without gods, without goddesses, without heavens, without hells, without a quest for mastery, without personal ambition. You simply take the Steps to Knowledge to enable you to do such a task, which has been achieved so rarely in human life before. A preparation is provided to provide the Steps to Knowledge and to take you up the mountain of life.</p>
<p>在这里，你学会诚实公正地看待你自己，评估你的弱点和你的优势，纠正弱点，增强优势。你做到这一点，不需要一套伟大的正式信仰，不需要英雄，不需要神，不需要女神，不需要天堂，不需要地狱，不需要对主宰的追求，不需要个人野心。你只需踏上内识进阶，就能完成这样的任务，而这在人类生命中以前是很少实现的。内识进阶的准备工作已经准备好，它将带你登上生命之山。</p>
<p>Along the way, you will have to re-evaluate your relationships and in the process of doing this will create a whole new foundation for how to relate to other people. Here you will look for the evidence of Knowledge, meaning and purpose in others. Rather than being charmed by their appearance or their behavior, rather than seek to have their resources or their assets, you will seek for a deeper resonance and a deeper compatibility.</p>
<p>在此过程中，你将必须重新评估你的关系，在此过程中，你将为如何与他人建立关系创造一个全新的基础。在这里，你将在他人身上寻找内识、意义和目的的证据。你将寻求一种更深层次的共鸣和一种更深层次的兼容性，而不是被他们的外表或行为所吸引，不是寻求拥有他们的资源或资产。</p>
<p>For truly, in The Way of Knowledge, people who are very dissimilar, who could never really get along on a personal basis alone, can find a foundation substantial enough to commit themselves with each other and to each other to achieve a greater purpose in life. Such is the power and the grace of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因为事实上，在内识之路中，那些性格迥异的、单凭个人基础永远无法真正相处的人们，可以找到一个足够坚实的基础，彼此承诺，共同实现更伟大的生命目的。这就是内识的力量和恩典。</p>
<p>Here you find a way to transcend many of the problems that circumscribe you today. And though you will have personal problems in the future, they will no longer be strong enough to prevent you from moving forward. For your personal mind, the mind that was developed and conditioned in the world, will always have difficulties in comprehending greater things. But as the knowing Mind within you, the Mind of Knowledge, emerges and takes its rightful place in your awareness, you will be able to deal with yourself compassionately. You will not allow small disabilities to thwart you from undertaking your greater endeavors.</p>
<p>在这里，你会找到一种方法来超越今天困扰你的许多问题。虽然你将来会遇到个人问题，但这些问题将不再强大到阻止你前进。因为你的个人心灵，即在世界上发展和受制约的心灵，在理解更伟大的事物方面总是会遇到困难。但是，随着你内心深处的知道心灵，即内识的心灵，在你的觉知中出现并占据其应有的位置，你将能够富有同情心地对待你自己。你不会让渺小的缺陷阻碍你进行更伟大的事业。</p>
<p>Gaining this greater vantage point means you have to leave where you are now in terms of your consciousness and in terms of your beliefs. You cannot take them all with you. If you try to take them all with you, you stay right where you are.</p>
<p>获得这种更伟大的观测点意味着你必须离开你现在的意识和信仰。你无法带走它们。如果你试图把它们都带走，你就只能留在原地。</p>
<p>Just like you cannot take the place [you are in] with you if you are going to journey up the mountain. You have to leave it behind even if it is a beautiful place, even if you have found an idyllic resting place on the mountain, and you wish, “Oh, this is so beautiful! I could stay here forever. This is so much better than any place I have ever been.” Even if you have this experience, to progress you must move on.</p>
<p>就像你要去登山，就不能把（你所在的）地方带走。你必须离开它，即使它是一个美丽的地方，即使你在山上找到了一个田园诗般的休息之地，即使你希望，“哦，这太美了！我可以永远呆在这里。这里比我去过的任何地方都要好。”即使你有这样的经历，要想进步，你就必须继续前进。</p>
<p>Here you gain the strength and the understanding not to allow anything in life to thwart your greater purpose and endeavor. And here you find that you will not journey alone. The essence of the teachings in The Way of Knowledge is that they teach you that you are not alone. They teach you that you are already part of community and give you the basis and the foundation for establishing this primary relationship in community with others.</p>
<p>在这里，你获得实力和理解，不允许生命中的任何事物阻碍你更伟大的目的和事业。在这里，你会发现你不会孤单一人。内识之路教导的精髓在于它们教导你，你并不是独自一人。它们教导你，你已经是社区的一部分，并为你在社区中与他人建立这种基本关系奠定了基础。</p>
<p>Then when you marry, you marry completely, and your marriage is deep and resonating. Then when you join with others in your work, you join with a greater sense of purpose and commitment, unwilling to let personal issues destroy the union that you are now setting out to build together.</p>
<p>然后当你结婚时，你们的婚姻是完全的，你们的婚姻是深刻而有共鸣的。然后当你和其他人一起工作时，你会带着更伟大的目的感和责任感，不愿意让个人问题破坏你们现在正在共同建立的联盟。</p>
<p>The higher you go on the mountain, the more you realize you are not alone. This enables you to think with a bigger mind and to have a bigger perspective. And you learn as you go what constitutes a foundation for real relationship. And you see that it is not romance. It is not beauty. It is not money. It is not charm. It is not recreation.</p>
<p>在山上爬得越高，你就越意识到你并不孤单。这让你能够用更广阔的心灵进行思考，拥有更广阔的视野。你会在攀登过程中学到什么构成了真正的关系的基础。你会看到它不是浪漫。不是美貌。不是金钱。不是魅力。不是娱乐。</p>
<p>These things are alluring in their own right, but they do not provide the foundation for real relationship. Here you find that foundation because you are building it within yourself. As Knowledge is growing within you, it becomes the basis upon [which you build] your relationships with others. This gives you the power to overcome personal differences and to deal with issues and problems as they arise. Then when you reach a vantage point from which you can see more, you will have a greater understanding about the meaning of life and the fundamental nature of relationships.</p>
<p>这些事物本身就很诱人，但它们无法为真正的关系提供基础。在这里，你找到了基础，因为你在你自己内在构建它。随着内识在你内在成长，它成为你与他人关系的基础。这赋予你力量去克服个人差异，并处理出现的问题和困难。然后当你达到一个能够看得更远的观测点时，你将对生命的意义和关系的根本自然有更伟大的理解。</p>
<p>As We have said, the Greater Community is not made up of magnificent and varied individuals. It is made up of communities and groups. Within the Greater Community, the important thing is what group you are a part of, what relationships you establish.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，大社区并非由杰出而多样的个体组成。它是由社区和群体组成。在大社区里，重要的是你属于哪个群体，你建立了什么样的关系。</p>
<p>In the world at this time there is still a tremendous emphasis on the individual. Individuals are admired and they are deified. There is hero worship here. That marks an important difference between life in the Greater Community and life within your world.</p>
<p>当今世界仍然高度重视个体。个体受到钦佩，被神化。这里存在着英雄崇拜。这标志着大社区生命与你们世界生命之间的重要区别。</p>
<p>If you can establish and become part of a community of Knowledge in your relationships, then you have set out to begin the most important establishment in life. It is from this establishment that great gifts will be given into the world, that the world’s difficulties will be addressed, that the grievous errors in human life will be rectified and that a new foundation can be built over time.</p>
<p>如果你能在关系中建立并成为内识社区的一部分，那么你就已经开始着手生命中最重要的建立。正是从这个建立开始，伟大的礼物才会被赠予世界，世界的困难才会得到解决，人类生命中的严重错误才会得到纠正，随着时间的推移，新的基础才会建立。</p>
<p>This is all the result of reaching this greater vantage point. This is all the result of building a Greater Community perspective and understanding. This is the result of going beyond yourself to see yourself and going beyond the limits of human consciousness and awareness to see the real condition of humanity.</p>
<p>这都是达到这个更伟大观测点的结果。这都是构建大社区视角和理解的结果。这都是超越你自己，看清你自己、超越人类意识和觉知的局限看清人类实际状况的结果。</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this, given all of the influences that prevail upon humanity today? Is it possible for you to do this, given your current circumstances and condition? The answer is a resounding yes. It is not only possible; it is necessary; it is vital; it is needed. It is not merely a wish or a preference; it is a must in life.</p>
<p>考虑到当今人类所受到的各种影响，有可能做到这一点吗？考虑到你目前的情况和条件，你有可能做到这一点吗？答案是肯定的。这不仅是可能的；而且是必要的；这是至关重要的；这是必需的。这不仅仅是一种愿望或偏好；它是生命中的必修课。</p>
<p>This is what is awaiting you. This is what you want and what you need. This is what your heart yearns for, even if you are uncertain and afraid.</p>
<p>这就是等待着你的内识。这就是你想要的和你需要的内识。这就是你内心的渴望，即使你不确定和害怕。</p>
<p>Knowledge will bring you here, for only Knowledge can take you to Knowledge. That is why Knowledge becomes strong as you travel in The Way of Knowledge and take the Steps to Knowledge. Only Knowledge can take you to this greater vantage point, which is why by the time you arrive, you will become much stronger in Knowledge than you ever were before.</p>
<p>内识将带你来到这里，因为只有内识能带你走向内识。这就是为什么当你在内识之路上旅行并开展内识进阶时，内识会变得强大。只有内识能带你到达这个更伟大的观测位置，这就是为什么当你到达时，你的内识会变得比以前强大得多。</p>
<p>Personal ambition will not take you there; personal will will not take you there; the desire for riches and rewards will not take you there. Only Knowledge will take you there. And only relationships that are capable of embodying and expressing Knowledge will be able to travel with you as you journey up the mountain of life and begin to leave the confinement of the forest below.</p>
<p>个人野心不会带你到达那里；个人意志不会带你到达那里；对财富和回报的渴望不会带你到达那里。只有内识才能带你到达那里。只有能够体现和表达内识的关系才能在你攀登生命之山并开始摆脱下方森林的束缚时陪伴你。</p>
<p>It is time to begin your Greater Community preparation. This is your fundamental spiritual education and development. It encompasses the great truths that humanity has discovered on its own, but it goes beyond them to embrace life in the Greater Community and to embrace the tradition of spiritual development and the reclamation of Knowledge that represents the fundamental work of the Creator within life on a large scale.</p>
<p>是时候开始你的大社区准备了。这是你基本的精神教育和发展。它涵盖了人类它自己发现的伟大真理，但它超越了这些真理，拥抱大社区的生命，拥抱精神发展的传统和内识的找回，内识代表了造物主在大规模生命中的基本工作。</p>
<p>The way is being provided, and you can begin. You begin with what you know today, and you build upon that. You begin with what you see today, and you build upon that. And you build each day. You do not take great leaps and bounds. You do not leap and bound up the mountain but take careful and determined steps.</p>
<p>道路已经铺就，你可以开始。你从今天所知开始，然后在此基础上继续前进。你从今天所见开始，然后在此基础上继续前进。你每天都在前进。你不需要大步前进。你不需要跳跃式地爬上高山，而是需要迈出谨慎而坚定的步伐。</p>
<p>The mountain is difficult. You are climbing. You can lose your way. You can lose your footing. You can become allured by things you see and experience along the way. You can become disheartened. That is why as you take each step, you become stronger. You become more focused. You become more determined. You become more forgiving and more compassionate, for you must proceed.</p>
<p>攀登高山是艰难的。你正在攀登。你可能会迷路。你可能会失去立足点。你可能会被沿途看到和经历的事物所吸引。你可能会灰心丧气。这就是为什么当你迈出每一步时，你会变得更强大。你会变得更加专注。你会变得更加坚定。你会变得更加宽容和富有同情心，因为你必须继续前进。</p>
<p>Developing a Greater Community perspective and understanding will give you the vantage point from which to understand and to discern the activities of Greater Community presences in the world today. From a purely human viewpoint, you will not be able to understand these things, and you will not see them clearly. You must gain greater eyes and a greater discernment.</p>
<p>发展一种大社区视角和理解，将为你提供观测点，从中去理解和辨识当今世界大社区存在的活动。从纯粹的人类视角来看，你将无法理解这些事情，你将无法看清它们。你必须获得更伟大的眼睛和一种更伟大的辨别力。</p>
<p>Humanity has this capability, and it has this great need. You can do this. It can be done, and it must be done. And you will find that your discernment will not be carried out by you alone, but will be the result of many people pooling their intelligence to create a group mind focus. This creates a strength in the mental environment that an individual alone could not produce and direct.</p>
<p>人类有这种能力，也有这种伟大的需求。你可以做到这一点。这是可以做到的，而且必须做到。你会发现，你的辨别能力不会由你一个人完成，而是许多人集思广益，创造集体心灵焦点的结果。这在心理环境中创造了一种个人无法产生和指导的力量。</p>
<p>It is said in The Way of Knowledge that there are no great individuals; there are only great relationships. How true this is, and how important this will be for you in cultivating a greater intelligence and awareness within yourself.</p>
<p>内识之路中说，没有伟大的个人，只有伟大的关系。这句话是多么真实啊，它对于培养你内在一种更伟大的智能和觉知是多么重要。</p>
<p>For it is known that anyone can make an error at any time and that the greatest prevention against making such errors is to have another set of eyes, another intelligence, looking with you to share in the looking, to join in the looking, to develop the discernment together, to develop the strength together, to experience the Grace together.</p>
<p>众所周知，任何人都可能随时犯错，而避免犯错的最好方法是拥有另一双眼睛，另一种智能，与你一起观察，共同观察，共同发展辨别力，共同发展力量，共同体验恩典。</p>
<p>That is why The Way of Knowledge is The Way of Relationship. It is the path of joining. Here you give up your ambitions for personal enlightenment and instead begin the real spiritual work of beginning the reclamation of Knowledge within yourself, and developing the essential aspects of wisdom that will enable you to be in relationship completely and to build the group mind in Knowledge that We are speaking of.</p>
<p>这就是为什么内识之路是关系之路。它是一条加入之路。在这里，你放弃了个人启蒙的野心，转而开始真正的精神工作，开始在你内心重新找回内识，发展智慧的必要方面，这将使你能够完全处于关系中，并在内识中建立我们所说的集体心灵。</p>
<p>Ultimately, what will enable humanity to establish itself in the Greater Community and to maintain its self-determination within this larger mental and physical environment, is to develop a group mind experience not based upon political persuasion, not based upon religious ideology, not based on the machinations of government, but upon the essential nature of Knowledge within each person.</p>
<p>最终，让人类能够在大社区中立足，并在这个更大的心理和物理环境里保持自决权的，是发展一种集体心灵体验，这种体验不是基于政治说服，不是基于宗教意识形态，不是基于政府阴谋，而是基于每个人内在内识的基本自然。</p>
<p>Here the group mind experience is not produced by millions of beings but by small groups who are able to look for everyone. They are the watchtowers. They are the telescopes. They are the microscopes. They are the magnifiers of experience.</p>
<p>在这里，集体心灵体验不是由数百万人产生的，而是由能够关注每个人的小群体产生的。他们是瞭望塔。他们是望远镜。他们是显微镜。他们是经验的放大器。</p>
<p>Here humanity can gain not only a position of survival but a position of advantage. For your visitors, though highly technically skilled and with great social cohesion, cannot offset the effects of Knowledge itself. Indeed, ultimately you may be able to influence them for the good. But until that time, you must be able to counter the effects of their presence and learn what it means in terms of the priorities of your life and the conditions that it will establish for the future.</p>
<p>在这里，人类不仅能获得生存位置，还能获得优势位置。因为你们的探访者，尽管技术娴熟，社会凝聚力强，却无法抵消内识本身的影响。事实上，最终你们或许能够对他们产生好的影响。但在那之前，你必须能够抵消他们存在的影响，并学习这对你生命的优先事项以及它将为未来确立的条件意味着什么。</p>
<p>There is great promise for humanity despite the grave risks it is facing now. But do not let this take from your attention that the need for preparation is vital. Let this not dissuade you from what you must do. Let this not give you false confidence. Greatness is achieved through great activity and through great relationships. It is the great activity and the great relationships that must be emphasized now.</p>
<p>尽管人类现在面临着巨大的风险，但人类仍然有着伟大的承诺。但不要因此而忽视了至关重要的准备工作。不要因此而放弃你必须做的事情。不要因此而给你虚假的信心。伟大是通过伟大的活动和伟大的关系实现的。现在必须强调的是伟大的活动和伟大的关系。</p>
