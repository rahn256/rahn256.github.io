<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 27, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年10月27日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You were sent into the world for a greater purpose, a greater purpose that you have not yet discovered. This greater purpose is held within a deeper Knowledge within you, within a deeper Intelligence within you called Knowledge. It will emerge when you are ready to participate within it, and when you have come to realize and experience the deeper need of your soul—to know your purpose, your meaning and your true direction in life.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界上是为了一个更伟大的目的，一个你还没有发现的更伟大的目的。这个更伟大的目的存在于你内在的一个更深层次的内识中，存在于你内在一种更深层次的智能中，也就是内识中。当你准备好参与其中时，当你开始意识到并体验到你灵魂更深层次的需求时，它就会出现——来知道你的目的、你的意义和你生命中的真实方向。</p>
<p>This greater purpose is with you. You cannot change it, but how and when it will emerge is dependent upon the circumstances of your life, upon the decisions that you make and upon your changing environment.</p>
<p>这个更伟大的目的与你同在。你无法改变它，但它如何以及何时出现，取决于你的生命情况、你所做的决定以及你不断变化的环境。</p>
<p>You are carrying this purpose within you, even at this moment. It is a gift from God to the world. It will be given where it is most needed. And it will be your great joy to contribute this gift because it will affirm your design, and it will affirm the purpose and the value of your life.</p>
<p>即便在此刻，你内心也携带着这个目的。它是上帝赐予世界的礼物。它将被赐予最需要它的地方。贡献这份礼物将是你最大的快乐，因为它将肯定你的设计，它将肯定你生命的目的和价值。</p>
<p>Your greater purpose is specific to involve certain people and certain situations. It will call certain people to you who are destined to be a part of this greater purpose and who are destined to support it in one way or another. Some of these people will come into your life only temporarily, and others will come to take a greater journey with you.</p>
<p>你的更伟大目的是专门针对特定的人和特定情况的。它将召唤特定的人来到你身边，这些人注定要成为这个更伟大目的的一部分，注定要以某种方式支持它。其中一些人只是暂时进入你的生命，而其他人会来和你一起踏上更伟大的旅程。</p>
<p>These relationships are unique, for your attraction to them will not be based upon wealth, beauty or charm but upon a deeper resonance that you have with the other person. And there will be more than one of these people. They may serve as a teacher. They may serve as a great companion. They may serve as someone you work closely with. Or they may serve as your husband or your wife. They may serve in many capacities here, depending upon the nature of your life and the nature of your purpose that you are here to serve. Perhaps you will need only one companion in your greater journey here. Perhaps you will need many, depending upon the nature of your gift and your own design.</p>
<p>这些关系是独一无二的，因为你对他们的吸引力并非基于财富、美貌或魅力，而是基于你与对方更深层次的共鸣。而且这些人不止一个。他们可能是一位老师。他们可能是一位伟大的同伴。他们可能是一位与你密切合作的人。或者他们可能成为你的丈夫或妻子。他们可能在这里以多种身份服务，这取决于你生命的自然和你在此服务的目的的性质。或许你在此的更伟大旅程中只需要一位同伴。或许你需要更多，这取决于你的礼物和你自己设计的自然。</p>
<p>These relationships will come into being when you are ready, when you need them, and when you have gained enough maturity and discernment to comprehend their meaning and to not misconstrue their importance in your life. This represents an entirely different realm of relationships, for you are resonating together at a deeper level, and you have a greater service to perform together for the well-being of others and the world.</p>
<p>当你准备好了，当你需要它们，当你获得了足够的成熟和辨识力去理解它们的意义并且不会误解它们在你生命中的重要性时，这些关系就会出现。这代表着一种完全不同的关系领域，因为你们在一种更深层次的层面上产生共鸣，你们要一起为他人和世界的福祉履行更伟大的服务。</p>
<p>In essence, the search for these people represents your search for relationships. But the problem is that you will search for relationships long before you are ready to experience a relationship of destiny, a relationship that represents your higher purpose in the world.</p>
<p>从本质上说，寻找这些人就代表着你寻找关系。但问题是，在你准备好体验天命关系（代表你在世界上的更高宗旨的关系）之前，你就会寻找关系。</p>
<p>Here people become attached to others; they marry others; they build a whole life with others before their greater purpose has really had a chance to emerge. Here marriage is often premature, and it is not based upon the greater criteria that represent a true union in life.</p>
<p>在这里，人们开始依附于他人；他们与他人结婚；他们与他人共建了整个生命，而他们的更伟大目的却还没有真正有机会呈现。在这里，婚姻往往是不成熟的，它并非基于代表生命中一种真实结合的更伟大标准。</p>
<p>For a greater purpose will likely not emerge until a little later, until you have come to terms with your deeper inclinations in life, until you have learned some important lessons in discernment and discretion. Here life will teach you the difference between what is good and what only looks good. Life will teach you what to value in others and how not to be seduced by beauty, wealth or charm, which have nothing to do with the real nature and character of the other person.</p>
<p>因为一个更伟大的目的很可能要等到稍后才会出现，直到你开始面对你生命中更深层次的倾向，直到你学会了一些重要的辨别力和谨慎的课程。在这里，生命将教会你什么是好的，什么只是看上去好的。生命将教你如何珍视他人，以及如何不被美貌、财富或魅力所诱惑，因为这些与他人的真正自然和品格毫无关系。</p>
<p>The important understanding here is to seek your greater purpose first. That is what your youth is for. It is not to lose yourself in fantasies, hobbies and other forms of escape. It is not to entertain endless romances with people with whom you have no real purpose or destiny.</p>
<p>这里最重要的理解是，首先要寻求你更伟大的目的。这就是你青春的意义所在。青春不是让你迷失在幻想、爱好和其他形式的逃避中。青春不是让你与那些与你没有真正目的或天命的人进行无尽的浪漫。</p>
<p>The critical questions are: “What am I really here to do? What do I really have to offer? And where are my gifts most needed in the world?” If people could focus on these in their youth, if the education system could be directed to these fundamental questions, the world you experience today would look very different.</p>
<p>关键问题是：“我来这里真正要做什么？我真正能提供什么？世界上哪里最需要我的礼物？”如果人们在年轻时能够关注这些问题，如果教育系统能够针对这些基本问题，那么你今天所经历的世界将会截然不同。</p>
<p>People would marry later in life, once they have established a direction and a foundation. For how can you be known to others when you are not even known to yourself? And how can you teach your children what to recognize and what to value in others if you yourself have not learned these skills?</p>
<p>人们会在生命的较晚阶段结婚，一旦他们确定了方向和基础。因为当你都不知道你自己时，又如何能让他人知道你呢？如果你自己都没有学会这些技能，你又怎么能教导你的孩子认识他人、珍视他人的哪些方面呢？</p>
<p>Seek first to know yourself and your true direction in life. Seek first to discover the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself and to listen to what it is teaching you; to experience its motivations and its restraints, its guidance and its direction.</p>
<p>首先寻求知道你自己和你生命中真实的方向。首先寻求发现你内在内识的力量和存在，​​并聆听它正在教导你什么；体验它的动机和约束、它的指导和方向。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not impressed by beauty, wealth and charm. And Knowledge is not dominated by social conditioning or by the persuasions of others—your family or even your culture. It knows who you are really looking for, and it knows how you are to participate with them and for what purpose.</p>
<p>内识不会被美貌、财富和魅力所打动。内识不会受到社会条件或他人的说服——你的家庭甚至你的文化——的支配。它知道你真正要找的人是谁，它知道你将如何与他们参与以及为了什么目的。</p>
<p>Yet people are not aware of the power and presence of Knowledge within themselves, and they often do not heed and experience the messages that Knowledge is sending to them. They do not realize that when they feel restraint regarding becoming involved with another person that this restraint should be honored; that when you are in doubt, you should hold yourself back and not push yourself forward to meet the expectations of others, or to acquire some notion of wealth or personal benefit.</p>
<p>然而人们没有察觉到他们内在内识的力量和存在，​​他们常常没有留意和体验内识发送给他们的讯息。他们没有意识到，当他们对于与他人交往感到克制时，这种克制应该得到尊重；当你心存疑虑时，你应该克制你自己，不要为了满足他人的期望或获得某种财富或个人利益而强行前进。</p>
<p>People give their lives away before they even know what their lives are, or what their lives are for. This creates a great problem because when Knowledge does emerge, if it can emerge, it will seem to challenge everything you have created previously, and you will be afraid of it—afraid it will threaten your establishments, your relationships, your goals, your priorities. You are afraid it will upset other people and disappoint their expectations.</p>
<p>人们在甚至不知道他们的生命是什么、或生命为何而生之前就放弃了他们的生命。这造成了一个大问题，因为当内识确实出现时，如果它能够出现的话，它似乎会挑战你之前创造的一切，而你会害怕它——害怕它会威胁你的建构、你的关系、你的目标、你的优先事项。你害怕它会惹恼其他人并辜负他们的期望。</p>
<p>Here it is like Knowledge has to compete with everything you have created previously, and under these circumstances, Knowledge can rarely emerge. And if you do choose to follow it and honor it, it will be very difficult to alter or to undo what you have created before. And if a relationship of destiny comes into your life, it will be in such contrast to all your other relationships that you will not know how to deal with it. You may be afraid of it. You may doubt it. And other people in your life may oppose the presence of this individual.</p>
<p>在这里，内识似乎必须与你先前创造的一切竞争，在这种情况下，内识很少能够出现。如果你确实选择遵循它并尊重它，那么改变或撤销你先前创造的事情将非常困难。如果一个天命关系进入你的生命，它将与你所有其他关系形成如此鲜明的对比，以至于你将不知道如何处理它。你或许会害怕它。你或许会怀疑它。你生命中的其他人或许会反对这个人的存在。</p>
<p>Here you will experience an intense struggle between what you know, what you want and what you are bound to. It is for this reason that Knowledge will generally emerge in early adulthood and, to a lesser degree, somewhere in midlife. It is as if there are two times of your life where you can cast your life and determine your direction. One is in late adolescence and early adulthood, and the second is in midlife.</p>
<p>在这里，你将经历一场激烈的斗争，在你所知道的、你想要的和你注定要做的事情之间。正是出于这个原因，内识通常会在成年早期出现，在较小程度上，在中年某个时候出现。就好像你的生命中有两个时期你可以决定你的生命和方向。一个是在青春期后期和成年早期，另一个是在中年。</p>
<p>Young adulthood really should be focused on determining your relationship with yourself, particularly your relationship with Knowledge, and your purpose and direction in life—what you are here to do and what you will need to do to support yourself and to develop your skills and so forth.</p>
<p>青年时期的真正重点应该是确定你与你自己的关系，特别是你与内识的关系，以及你生命中的目的和方向——你来这里要做什么，你需要做什么来支持你自己，发展你的技能等等。</p>
<p>In midlife, often people have reached a place of disappointment and many things have begun to fall away, giving them an opportunity to reassess where they need to go in life. But their task is more difficult because now they have to contend not only with all of their previous relationships and involvements, but also the lack of trust and confidence that they have created within their own lives, having given themselves away to so many things that have proven to be insufficient or unwise.</p>
<p>人到中年，往往会陷入失望，很多事情开始消失，这让他们有机会重新评估生命的方向。但他们的任务更加艰巨，因为他们现在不仅要应对以前的所有关系和参与，还要应对他们自己生命中缺乏信任和信心的问题，因为他们已经把他们自己投入到太多被证明不够或不明智的事情中。</p>
<p>It is more difficult here to build a relationship with Knowledge with all of this history working against you. And the wounds and the regrets and the unforgiveness that can accumulate here in midlife can make it very difficult to set a new direction for oneself.</p>
<p>在这里，由于所有这些历史都在对你不利，所以与内识建立关系会更加困难。在中年时期可能积累的伤痛、遗憾和不宽恕会让你很难为自己设定新的方向。</p>
<p>Here many people simply capitulate and live out the remainder of their life with whatever they have created before, or they settle for things that are only slightly better than what they settled for previously. To make a breakthrough really in midlife requires a tremendous effort and self-exertion.</p>
<p>许多人只是屈服，用他们以前创造的一切度过余生，或者满足于比以前更好的生命。要想在中年真正取得突破，需要付出巨大的努力和自我奋斗。</p>
<p>But in essence here, you see, you have a second chance. What will give you the strength to choose wisely and not to fall prey to your own weaknesses or the demands or persuasions of others is the power and presence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>但本质上，你看，你拥有第二次机会。给予你力量做出明智选择，不沦为你自己弱点或他人要求或说服的牺牲品的，是你内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>And what will give you the experience of contrast that you need in relationships is the presence of a relationship of destiny. For this relationship, in whatever form it takes in your life, will produce such a contrast with all of your other personal associations that it will demonstrate that there is a deeper nature of relationship, a relationship that represents a higher purpose in life.</p>
<p>而赋予你关系中所需要的对比体验的，是一种天命关系的存在。因为这种关系，无论它在你的生命中以何种形式出现，都将与你所有其他的个人交往产生如此强烈的对比，它将证明存在着一种关系的更深层次的自然，一种代表着生命中一种更高宗旨的关系。</p>
<p>Perhaps this person will come into your life as a teacher, or perhaps a fellow student, or someone you meet through your work. But each of you will be struggling with an awareness of a deeper purpose and direction, struggling because this will stand in stark contrast to your personal goals and many of your personal obligations.</p>
<p>这个人也许会以老师的身份出现在你的生命中，也许是同学，也许是工作中认识的人。但你们每个人都会努力去觉知更深层次的目的和方向，因为这与你的个人目标和许多个人义务形成鲜明对比。</p>
<p>Here you will be able to truly help one another, and to advocate for one another, and to reinforce self-trust and a deeper wisdom in one another. Perhaps you will only journey together for a time, providing this mutual support. Or perhaps you will have a greater journey together. You will have to be patient and not jump to conclusions here because you do not yet know for sure.</p>
<p>在这里，你们将能够真正地互相帮助，互相提倡，并加强彼此的自我信任和一种更深层次的智慧。也许你们只会一起旅行一段时间，提供这种相互支持。或者也许你们将一起经历一段更伟大的旅程。你必须耐心等待，不要在这里妄下结论，因为你还不知道。</p>
<p>To have another person in your life who is responding to Knowledge and learning to follow and to trust Knowledge is such a tremendous reinforcement for you, for you could doubt Knowledge so easily because Knowledge stands in contrast to all the persuasions of the world.</p>
<p>你生命中拥有另一个人回应内识、学习追随和信任内识，这对你来说是一个极大的鼓舞，因为你会如此轻易地怀疑内识，因为内识与世界上所有的说服都形成对比。</p>
<p>It is a sacred agreement. It is a deeper connection. It represents your existence before you came into this world, and the purpose that has sent you into this world, and those of your Spiritual Family who are with you even at this moment beyond your visible range.</p>
<p>这是一份神圣的协议。这是一种更深层次的联接。它代表着你来到这个世界之前的存在，代表着将你送入这个世界的目的，代表着那些此刻在你视线范围之外与你同在的精神家庭。</p>
<p>You have great assistance in the heavenly state. Now you need assistance here on Earth, for you cannot undertake and even discover your greater purpose alone. You need relationships of an extraordinary kind—relationships that are not based on beauty, wealth or charm but upon a deeper resonance and a greater purpose.</p>
<p>你在天国得到了伟大的援助。现在，你需要地球上的帮助，因为你无法独自承担甚至发现你的更伟大目的。你需要一种非凡的关系——这种关系不是基于美貌、财富或魅力，而是基于更深层次的共鸣和更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You cannot add these qualities to a relationship that you are already in, or that you are attracted to, or want to establish with another person. These qualities are either there or they are not. You cannot invent them. You cannot add them on. They are either there or they are not.</p>
<p>你不能将这些品质添加到你已经拥有的、你被吸引的或想要与他人建立的关系中。这些品质要么存在，要么不存在。你无法发明它们。你无法添加它们。它们要么存在，要么不存在。</p>
<p>To prepare for relationships of this deeper nature, it is necessary that you develop your most primary relationship, and that is your relationship with Knowledge. Knowledge is the deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you, and to prepare you and lead you to experiencing a greater life in the world.</p>
<p>为了准备这种更深层次自然的关系，你必须发展你最主要的关系，那就是你与内识的关系。内识是上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的智能，它指导你、保护你、准备你并引领你体验世界上的一种更伟大生命。</p>
<p>This is your most primary relationship because it is your relationship with God. Here you are not dealing with a distant God, a God beyond all recognition in the world. This is dealing with an Intelligence that God has placed within you, that you must learn to experience and to distinguish from all the other voices in your mind.</p>
<p>这是你最主要的关系，因为这是你与上帝的关系。在这里，你不是在与一个遥远的上帝打交道，一个世上无法辨认的上帝。这是在与上帝放置在你内在的一个智能打交道，你必须学会​​去体验它，并将其与你心灵中的所有其他声音区分开来。</p>
<p>Here you take a journey in taking the Steps to Knowledge because there are so many things you must learn to gain the discernment and the wisdom to recognize Knowledge, to follow Knowledge and to express what Knowledge gives you to express, constructively, with wisdom.</p>
<p>在这里，你开展内识进阶，踏上一段旅程，因为有太多事情你必须学习，才能获得辨别力和智慧，从而认知内识、遵循内识并以建设性的方式、带着智慧表达内识赋予你的礼物。</p>
<p>It is not a sudden event where all of a sudden your life is transformed and you become wise instantly. You become wise gradually. And life gives you every opportunity to develop this wisdom.</p>
<p>这不是突然发生的事件，你的生命不会突然改变，你也不会立刻变得明智。你会逐渐变得明智。生命会给你各种机会来发展这种智慧。</p>
<p>The world is full of people who are demonstrating to you in every possible way the consequences of living without this Knowledge. Here everyone is supporting you in recognizing the central importance of Knowledge in your life. And people are giving you the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to discern Knowledge and to interpret its signs correctly.</p>
<p>这个世界充满了以各种可能的方式向你展示没有这个内识进行生活后果的人。在这里，每个人都在支持你认识到内识在你生命中的核心重要性。人们给你机会发展必要的技能，以辨别内识并正确解读它的迹象。</p>
<p>If you are not strong with Knowledge, then when a relationship of destiny comes into your life, you will not know how to respond. You may even reject this person who has been sent to you. You may experience profound confusion in how to deal with them and to what form your relationship should take. They will arouse, under these circumstances, great confusion and inner conflict for you. You may not be able to recognize them or to understand the meaning of their presence in your life.</p>
<p>如果你的内识不够强大，那么当一个天命关系进入你的生命时，你将不知道如何回应。你甚至可能拒绝这个被派到你身边的人。你可能会体验到深刻的困惑，不知道如何对待他们，不知道你们的关系应该采取什么形式。在这种情况下，他们会给你带来巨大的困惑和内心冲突。你可能无法认出他们，也无法理解他们在你生命中存在的意义。</p>
<p>If you do not have a relationship of this nature in your life, do not worry. They will come. But first you must develop your relationship with Knowledge and take the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果你生命中没有这种性质的关系，不要担心。它们会来的。但首先你必须发展你与内识的关系，并开展内识进阶。</p>
<p>Think of it like this: You were born with two minds. You have a worldly mind that has been shaped by your family, your culture and your experiences in the world, a mind that is full of doubt and confusion and full of persuasions that have originated largely outside and beyond your own awareness.</p>
<p>可以这样想：你生来就有两个心灵。你有一个心灵是世俗的，它受到你的家庭、你的文化和你在世间的经历的影响；这个心灵充满了怀疑和困惑，充满了主要源自你自己觉知之外的说服力。</p>
<p>Then you have a deeper Mind, a Mind that has been created by God. This Mind is not confused. It does not deliberate. It does not debate. It does not judge and condemn. It does not become attached to insignificant things. It is not confused. And it is not afraid of the world. This deeper Mind of Knowledge within you is so vastly different from your personal mind, your worldly mind.</p>
<p>接着，你还拥有了一个更深层次的心灵，一个由上帝创造的心灵。这个心灵不会困惑。它不会深思熟虑。它不会辩论。它不会评判和谴责。它不会执着于无关紧要的事情。它不会困惑。它也不害怕世界。你内在的这个更深层次的内识心灵与你的个人心灵、你的世俗心灵有着巨大的不同。</p>
<p>At first, you may try to use Knowledge as a resource, to help you gain more of what you want—to gain wealth, to gain companionship, to find love. But Knowledge is not a resource for the personal mind. In reality, it is the other way around. The personal mind is a resource for Knowledge. But this requires a real shift within you to understand what this really means.</p>
<p>一开始，你可能会试图把内识作为一种资源，帮助你获得更多你想要的事物——获得财富、获得陪伴、找到爱。但内识并不是个人心灵的资源。事实上，情况恰恰相反。个人心灵是内识的资源。但这需要你内在的真正转变，才能理解这真正意味着什么。</p>
<p>The intellect is not merely what you think it is. It is really a vehicle of communication for Spirit. And the body is a vehicle of communication for the Spirit. This is the true nature and function of the mind and the body. The body serves the mind and the mind serves the Spirit. This is the true hierarchy of Being within you.</p>
<p>智力并非你所想的那样。它实际上是精神交流的一种载体。而身体也是精神交流的一种载体。这是心灵和身体的真实自然和功能。身体服务于心灵，心灵服务于精神。这是你内在存在的真实层级。</p>
<p>But when people begin their great journey in discovering a higher purpose in life, this is not their starting point. Most people begin thinking that the Spirit is there to serve the mind, and the mind is there to serve the body. This utter confusion, this misunderstanding, makes it very difficult for you to discern the importance of your mind, the importance of your body and how to guide and to use them effectively.</p>
<p>但当人们开始探索生命中更高宗旨的伟大旅程时，这并不是他们的起点。大多数人开始认为，精神是为了服务于心灵而存在的，而心灵是为了服务于身体。这种彻底的混乱，这种错误理解，让你很难辨别你心灵的重要性，你身体的重要性，以及如何有效地引导和使用它们。</p>
<p>Here the mind is like a slave to the needs of the body, and the body is the slave to the needs of the mind. And if the Spirit is thought of at all, it is thought of as a kind of resource, or life preserver. Here the mind tries to use Spirit to achieve its goals and to gain its acquisitions. But Knowledge cannot be used like this. It is not a resource for your intellect. It is really the guiding power and presence of your life.</p>
<p>在这里，心灵就像是身体需求的奴隶，而身体又是心灵需求的奴隶。如果说到精神，它就会被认为是一种资源，或救生圈。在这里，心灵试图利用精神来实现它的目标并获得它的收获。但内识无法被这样使用。它不是你智力的资源。它实际上是你生命的指导力量和存在。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is natural for you to seek relationships that represent your higher purpose. But first you must cultivate your relationship with Knowledge. You must feel the movement of Knowledge and see how much this is in contrast to your wishes, your fears and your general thinking.</p>
<p>因此，你很自然地会寻求代表你更高宗旨的关系。但首先你必须培养你与内识的关系。你必须感受内识的运动，并看到这与你的愿望、你的恐惧和你的一般想法有多么不同。</p>
<p>You must look at the world compassionately, without condemnation, to see how people are demonstrating to you the consequences of living without Knowledge; and how this undermines people’s mental and physical health; and leads them to make foolish decisions in their relationships; and leads them to misconstrue what life is telling them and what their own deeper experience is telling them.</p>
<p>你必须同情地、不带谴责地看着这个世界，看清人们如何向你展示没有内识生活的后果；以及这如何破坏人们的心理和身体健康；导致他们在关系里做出愚蠢的决定；导致他们误解生命告诉他们的事情以及他们自己更深层次体验告诉他们的事情。</p>
<p>Therefore, your first relationship is your relationship with Knowledge. The stronger you are in this relationship, the more difficult it will be for you to make a mistake, particularly a very consequential mistake—a mistake in discernment in relationships, for example.</p>
<p>因此，你的第一个关系是你与内识的关系。你在这个关系里越强大，你就越难犯错误，尤其是非常严重的错误——例如，关系中辨别力的错误。</p>
<p>Here your values will begin to change. Your priorities will begin to change. Instead of seeking escape and stimulation, you will want quiet more and more to feel the deeper movement of your life. Instead of seeking superficial relationships with others, you will seek a deeper connection. You will look for this. And you will not be satisfied with anything else.</p>
<p>在这里，你的价值观将开始改变。你的优先事项将开始改变。你不再寻求逃避和刺激，而是越来越想要安静，去感受你生命中更深层次的运动。你不再寻求与他人的肤浅关系，而是寻求更深层次的联接。你会寻找这个。你不会满足于其他任何事情。</p>
<p>Here self-honesty becomes really important. Here genuine and honest relationships with others become really important. Whereas before you were seeking to escape your deeper experience, now you are seeking to discover it, to recognize it and to honor it.</p>
<p>在这里，自我诚实变得非常重要。在这里，与他人建立真诚和诚实的关系变得非常重要。过去你寻求逃避你更深层次的体验，而现在你寻求发现它、认知它和尊重它。</p>
<p>This represents the greatest turning point in your life. It will create a shift in your values, in your priorities and what you look for in other people and what you look for in yourself. This shift is entirely natural. It represents a stage in your development that is entirely natural and appropriate. But because it will stand in contrast to your social conditioning and to the expectations of others, and perhaps your expectations of yourself, it will seem to be an immense interruption in your life.</p>
<p>这代表着你生命中最大的转折点。它将改变你的价值观、你的优先顺序、你在他人身上寻找的事物以及你在你自己身上寻找的事物。这种转变是完全自然的。它代表着你发展中的一个完全自然和恰当的阶段。但是，由于它将与你的社会条件、他人的期望以及你对你自己的期望形成鲜明对比，它似乎会成为你生命中一个极大的干扰。</p>
<p>Here the emergence of Knowledge can be resisted, feared, and doubted when, in fact, it is the most natural thing that could happen to you. But people have lost contact with what is natural. They have valued other things. People have become lost in the world, identifying with objects and places and people that really do not represent the deeper current of their lives.</p>
<p>在这里，内识的出现可能受到抵制、恐惧和怀疑，而事实上，这是可能发生在你身上最自然的事情。但人们已经失去了与自然的联系。他们珍视其他事物。人们迷失在世界上，认同那些并不真正代表他们生命更深层次潮流的物体、地方和人。</p>
<p>That is why when someone begins to respond to Knowledge and follow Knowledge, their life becomes extraordinary and inspiring and confusing to other people because Knowledge is so rare in the world, and anyone who can follow Knowledge becomes a significant contributor to other people, an inspiration to other people, and a demonstration that people do not have to become slaves to their social conditioning or to whatever power attempts to rule their lives.</p>
<p>正因为如此，当一个人开始回应内识并遵循内识时，他们的生命变得非凡、鼓舞人心、令其他人困惑，因为内识在世界上如此罕见，任何能够遵循内识的人都会成为其他人的重要贡献者、其他人的灵感，并证明人们不必成为他们社会条件或任何试图统治他们生命力量的奴隶。</p>
<p>In this, Knowledge is truly revolutionary, but it is also loving and compassionate. Here people become much more free than the people they associate with. They become much more genuine and authentic than what they see in the world around them. And as a result, they begin to value things that are more fundamental to life and more essential for human happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>在这里，内识是真正革命性的，但它也是充满爱和同情的。在这里，人们变得比他们交往的人自由得多。他们变得比他们在周围世界所看到的更加真诚和真实。结果，他们开始珍视对生命更为根本、对人类幸福和满足更为重要的内识。</p>
<p>So do not worry if there is not another person in your life who demonstrates a greater purpose and direction, for this is your time to build your connection to Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此如果你生命中没有另一个人展示出更伟大目的和方向，不要担心，因为这是你构建你与内识联接的时候。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has sent a New Message for humanity, a New Message to rekindle the Fire of Knowledge within the individual, and to clarify the real nature and purpose of humanity’s One Spirituality at the level of Knowledge.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者向人类发送了一条新讯息，这条新讯息是为了重新点燃个体内心的内识之火，并在内识层面阐明人类唯一精神性的真正自然和目的。</p>
<p>This is the power of redemption that lives within you, for God reclaims the separated through Knowledge. And Knowledge is what gives you strength and integrity, power and purpose in the world, in a world where Knowledge is not recognized or highly valued.</p>
<p>这是生活在你内在的救赎力量，因为上帝通过内识重新唤回分离者。内识赋予你力量和完整性、力量和目的，在这个内识不被认出或高度重视的世界上。</p>
<p>This New Message from the Creator of all life has provided the Steps to Knowledge, the preparation. This is not the only preparation in the world, for throughout the ages there have been men and women who have discovered the power and the presence of Knowledge and have taught this to others.</p>
<p>来自所有生命创造者的这条新讯息提供了内识的进阶，即准备。这并不是世界上唯一的准备，因为古往今来，一直有男人和女人发现内识的力量和存在，​​并将其传授给他人。</p>
<p>But these rare teachers can be difficult to find. They are not the teachers you see on the television. They are not the celebrities who proclaim to have the secrets of the universe. The real teachers of Knowledge are hard to find, often living in remote places, often teaching very small numbers of people.</p>
<p>但这些罕见的老师很难找到。他们不是你在电视上看到的老师。他们不是那些宣称掌握宇宙秘密的名人。真正的内识老师很难找到，他们往往生活在偏远的地方，通常只教导很少的人。</p>
<p>God understands this, of course, and realizing the great need for Knowledge in the world today and in the times to come has sent a Message of pure preparation in the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>当然，上帝理解这一点，并意识到当今世界以及未来时代对内识的伟大需求，因此发送了内识进阶这条纯粹的准备讯息。</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a way to prepare, for you cannot prepare yourself, for you do not know the journey. And you may not have access to one of the real teachers of Knowledge alive in the world today. So God has provided the Steps to Knowledge for you.</p>
<p>因此，有一种方法可以让你做好准备，因为你无法为你自己做好准备，因为你不知道旅程。而且，你可能无法接触到当今世界上真正的内识老师。因此，上帝为你提供了内识的进阶。</p>
<p>In all the world’s traditions, there is a core teaching in The Way of Knowledge. But this core teaching can be very different from the public teaching that religions present and upon which they base their theories and their doctrines.</p>
<p>世界上所有的传统中，都有一个核心教导，即内识之路。但这个核心教导与宗教所呈现的公开教导（宗教理论和教义所基于的公开教导）可能大不相同。</p>
<p>A real teacher of Knowledge is rare, but they do exist. But if you do not know such a teacher or cannot gain access to such a teacher, then God has sent you the Steps to Knowledge. Within this preparation, you learn to focus your mind on the deeper current of your life. You learn to recognize the signs and the communications that Knowledge is giving you.</p>
<p>真正的内识老师是罕见的，但他们确实存在。但是，如果你不知道这样的老师，或者无法接触到这样的老师，上帝已经向你发送了内识进阶。在这个准备过程中，你将学会把心灵集中在你生命更深层次的潮流上。你学会识别内识给你的迹象和沟通。</p>
<p>Here you learn how to still your surface mind, your social mind, so that you can listen and have a deeper experience of your nature. Here inner doors begin to open, and you begin to experience a profound communication that has been going on your whole life, but which previously you have been unable to respond to.</p>
<p>在这里，你将学会如何平息你的表面心灵、你的社会心灵，这样你就可以倾听并更深入地体验你的自然。在这里，你的内心之门开始打开，你开始体验一种深刻的沟通，这种沟通贯穿了你的整个生命，但之前你却无法回应。</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a way. There is a path. You may be alone in your deeper inclinations, but you are working in concert with many others in the world who are all following this deeper and more profound education. This education is not an imposition of foreign ideas. Instead, it is a stimulation of your deepest and most natural inclinations. It is a stirring and a recognition of Knowledge within you, giving it the opportunity to emerge in your awareness and to exert its power and its grace in your life.</p>
<p>因此，有一种办法。有一条道路。在你更深层次的倾向中，你可能是孤独的，但你正在与世界上的许多其他人共同努力，他们都在追随这种更深层次、更深刻的教育。这种教育不是外来想法的强加。相反，它激发了你最深刻、最自然的倾向。它是对你内在内识的激发和认知，让内识有机会在你的觉知中浮现，并在你的生命中发挥它的力量和恩典。</p>
<p>This is how God speaks to you and influences you. This is how God protects you from making fatal errors in your life. This is how God guides you to stay out of harm’s way and to recognize the true path that you are to follow, a path that you would be unlikely to recognize otherwise.</p>
<p>这就是上帝对你说话和影响你的方式。这就是上帝保护你避免在生命中犯下致命错误的方式。这就是上帝引导你远离危险并认清你要走的正确道路的方式，否则你不太可能认清这条道路。</p>
<p>Here the relationships that come into your life to support this greater purpose will be deep and profound. They will have a power that transcends your divergent and perhaps different personalities. And they will be a confirmation for you that you truly have come into the world for a greater purpose—a purpose that you did not invent for yourself, a purpose that lives within you, waiting to be discovered and to be expressed in the changing circumstance of your life.</p>
<p>在这里，为了支持这个更伟大目的而进入你生命的关系将是深刻而深远的。它们将拥有一种超越你分歧的、或许是不同的人格的力量。它们将向你证实，你确实是为了一个更伟大目的来到世界上的——一个你并非为你自己发明的目的，一个活在你内在的目的，等待着被发现并在你生命不断变化的境遇里得到表达的目的。</p>
<p>When these individuals arrive, you must be very careful to discern the appropriate form of the relationship. Here perhaps your culture has conditioned you to think of relationships in terms of whether they represent a marriage or a benefactor. Here you must use a deeper discernment and have patience to allow this new kind of relationship to find a place in your life.</p>
<p>当这些人到来时，你必须非常小心地辨别这种关系的适当形式。在这里，或许你的文化已经让你习惯于以婚姻或恩人的角度来思考关系。在这里，你必须运用一种更深层次的辨别力，并有耐心让这种新关系在你的生命中找到一席之地。</p>
<p>For these relationships often do not represent marriages or benefactors. Here you will have to see where Knowledge is taking you and begin to gain a greater understanding of life, to see how these relationships fit into a greater plan for you.</p>
<p>因为这些关系往往不代表婚姻或恩人。在这里，你必须看到内识正在带你去哪里，并开始获得对生命的更伟大理解，看到这些关系如何融入你更伟大的计划。</p>
<p>It is like climbing a mountain. When you are at the bottom of the mountain, you cannot see the panorama of life. You can only see your immediate circumstances. You are engulfed in the valleys, in the trees, and you do not have any real perspective yet. And though someone may try to share with you a perspective from higher up the mountain, you yourself cannot really see this yet.</p>
<p>它就像爬山。当你在山脚下时，你看不到生命的全景。你只能看到你当下的情况。你被山谷、树木所吞没，你还没有任何真正的视角。尽管有人可能会试图与你分享来自山顶的视角，但你自己还无法真正看到这一点。</p>
<p>So the emphasis here is to get up this mountain, step by step. And as you begin your long ascent, you learn what is important to keep with you and what is important to set aside. You recognize what is really useful and necessary and what is merely a burden and a distraction.</p>
<p>因此，这里的重点是一步一步地爬上这座山。当你开始漫长的攀登时，你就会知道什么是重要的，什么是需要保留的，什么是需要搁置的。你会认识到什么是真正有用和必要的，什么只是负担和干扰。</p>
<p>Here you lighten your load. You rearrange your pack. You adjust your expectations, and you build the strength to carry on. Along the way, you will want to settle down. You will think you have gone far enough; you will want to tell yourself it is fine the way it is; it is enough for you.</p>
<p>在这里，你减轻了负担。你重新整理了行囊。你调整了期望，并积蓄力量继续前行。一路上，你会想安定下来。你会认为你已经走得够远了；你会想告诉你自己，这样就好了；这对你来说已经足够了。</p>
<p>But Knowledge keeps leading you on. It will not let you compromise your life. You must make this journey, for only this journey will give you the understanding and the awareness of what your life really is, and what it is for, and how it can be expressed most completely and in the way that is most satisfying.</p>
<p>但内识不断引领你前行。它不会让你妥协你的生命。你必须踏上这段旅程，因为只有这段旅程才能让你理解和觉知你的生命真正是什么，它是为了什么，以及如何才能最完整、以最令人满意的方式表达它。</p>
<p>Here on your journey up the mountain, others will come to follow, for they are journeying, too. Some of these will be lifelong companions for you, for the mountain is very great.</p>
<p>在你登山的路上，其他人也会来追随你，因为他们也在登山。其中一些人会成为你一生的伴侣，因为这座山是非常伟大的。</p>
<p>Here you will have to leave people behind who cannot or will not make this journey. Perhaps the time for them has not come for Knowledge to emerge in their experience. Or perhaps Knowledge is emerging, but they cannot accept it. They are too afraid and too insecure to recognize its central importance to their lives.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须放下那些不能或不愿踏上这段旅程的人们。或许内识在他们的体验中浮现的时机尚未到来。又或许内识正在浮现，但他们无法接受它。他们太过恐惧和缺乏安全感，以至于无法认识到内识对他们生命的核心重要性。</p>
<p>In either case, you cannot stay behind trying to convince them or trying to pull them up the mountain, for it is you who must go. And you will need all of your strength to make this journey. You cannot be pulling other people along, trying to rescue them, or to redeem them, or to convince them in any way. If they cannot see and cannot know, what can you do? Here you must go on and make the journey, even if it means leaving relationships behind.</p>
<p>无论如何，你都不能留下来试图说服他们或试图把他们拉上山，因为你必须走。你需要全力以赴才能完成这段旅程。你不能拉着其他人一起走，试图拯救他们，救赎他们，或以任何方式说服他们。如果他们看不见，不知道，你又能做什么呢？在这里你必须继续前行，即使这意味着离开关系。</p>
<p>You have a fundamental responsibility to raise your children to adulthood, and in some cases to take care of elderly parents who cannot take care of themselves. But beyond this, your first responsibility is to Knowledge, for this is your responsibility to God.</p>
<p>你肩负着一种基本的责任，将你的孩子抚养成人，在某些情况下，还要照顾无法照顾他们自身的年迈父母。但除此之外，你的首要责任是对内识，因为这是对上帝的责任。</p>
<p>People often think here that Knowledge is like another personality, that it is like their personal mind. They think that Knowledge is subject to all the weaknesses and the distractions of the personal mind.</p>
<p>人们常常认为内识就像另一个人格，就像他们的个人心灵。他们认为内识受制于个人心灵的所有弱点和干扰。</p>
<p>People think that God is subject to all the weaknesses and distractions of the personal mind. They think that God is angry or vengeful or jealous, which is, of course, ridiculous. How could the Creator of the entire universe be angry, vengeful or jealous? People think that God thinks like they do, with all of their weaknesses and weak dispositions.</p>
<p>人们认为上帝受制于个人心灵的所有弱点和干扰。他们认为上帝是愤怒的、报复心强的或嫉妒的，这当然是荒谬的。整个宇宙的创造者怎么会生气、报复或嫉妒呢？人们认为上帝和他们一样思考，带有他们所有的弱点和脆弱的倾向。</p>
<p>Some people will think that Knowledge is like this too, but it is not. That is what makes it so very different from your personal, social mind. That is what gives it power and consistency, strength and determination. For Knowledge within you cannot be seduced or induced by anything in the world. It only responds to Knowledge in others, and it only responds to God.</p>
<p>有些人会认为内识也是这样，但事实并非如此。这让内识与你的个人心灵、社会心灵如此不同。这赋予它力量和一致性、强度和决心。因为你内在的内识不会被世界上的任何事物诱惑或诱导。它只回应他人内在的内识，它只回应上帝。</p>
<p>You are so fortunate to have such a magnificent and trustworthy guide within yourself. And as you gain altitude on this mountain and learn to see beyond the tops of the trees and the limits of the valleys, you will begin to see that Knowledge really is your true Self, a Self that is not apart from life.</p>
<p>你很幸运，内心有这样一位伟大而值得信赖的向导。当你爬上这座山，学会看清树梢和山谷边缘之外的世界时，你会开始看到，内识实际上就是你真实的自我，一个与生命密不可分的自我。</p>
<p>You will see that being true to Knowledge is, in the purest sense, being true to yourself. You will see that you could never give your life fully to another person unless you are guided by Knowledge to do this, and that all other commitments and arrangements were by their very nature incomplete and limited in time.</p>
<p>你将看到，忠于内识，在最纯粹的意义上，就是忠于你自己。你将看到，除非你受到内识的指导，否则你永远无法将你的生命完全交给另一个人，而所有其他的承诺和安排本质上都是不完整的，并且有时间限制。</p>
<p>Here the emergence of Knowledge makes true union with another possible. This establishes marriage at a complete level, at a deeper level, beyond the limits of the intellect—a marriage or a friendship or a partnership that transcends human understanding and that has the power and the grace of God within it.</p>
<p>在这里，内识的出现使得与他人的真实结合成为可能。这就在一个完整的层面、一个更深层次、一个超越智力局限的层面上建立起了婚姻——一种超越人类理解并拥有上帝的力量和恩典的婚姻、友谊或伙伴关系。</p>
<p>These relationships will produce great value for others, for here you do not live just for the other person. You are here to contribute something greater to the world, to support something important in the world, to foster something significant, or to innovate something new for the welfare and benefit of humanity.</p>
<p>这些关系将为他人带来伟大的价值，因为在这里，你不仅仅是为他人而活。你在这里是为了对世界做出更伟大的贡献，是为了支持世界上重要的事情，是为了促进重要的事情，或是为了人类的福祉和利益而创新。</p>
<p>Here you are given the power and the gift of relationships at the level of a higher purpose. But first you must gain a sense and understanding and acceptance of a higher purpose in your life. And you must see that you cannot invent or control this higher purpose. You can only be a witness to it, and support it, and follow it, and learn from it.</p>
<p>在这里，你被赋予了一种更高宗旨层面上的力量和关系的礼物。但首先你必须获得对你生命中更高宗旨的感觉、理解和接受。你必须看到，你无法发明或控制这个更高宗旨。你只能见证它、支持它、追随它并从中学习。</p>
<p>This is following the greater journey in life. And this is freeing you at last to find the greatest fulfillment in life and the greatest contribution that you are here to give to the needs of humanity and to the changing needs of the world.</p>
<p>这就是追随生命中更伟大的旅程。这让你最终获得自由，找到生命中最大的满足感，以及你在这里为人类的需求和世界不断变化的需求做出的最伟大贡献。</p>
