<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 6, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月6日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is necessary that We talk about honesty within the context of preparing for the Greater Community and learning how to follow and live The Way of Knowledge. It could be said that the experience of Knowledge is the experience of profound honesty. This is the result of wanting to know the truth above and beyond all other considerations. It could be said that learning The Way of Knowledge is learning the way of honesty—going beyond the honesty of what you feel and think into the honesty of what you truly know.</p>
<p>我们有必要在为大社区做准备以及学习如何遵循和践行内识之路的背景下谈论诚实。可以说，内识的体验就是深刻诚实的体验。这是超越所有其他考虑而想要知道真理的结果。可以说，学习内识之路就是学习诚实之路——超越你所感受和思考的诚实，进入你真正知道的内识。</p>
<p>To begin, [you] must be honest with [your] inclinations, at least insofar as to realize that [you] must gain a greater freedom, ability and participation in life. You must have this honesty just to begin. Many people are not yet this honest. You must have greater honesty to be able to look at the Greater Community presence in the world and to gain the vantage point to see what it really is and what is really happening.</p>
<p>首先，你必须诚实地面对你的倾向，至少要认识到你必须获得更伟大的自由、能力和生命参与。你必须拥有这种诚实才能开始。很多人还没有这么诚实。你必须拥有更伟大的诚实，才能看清大社区在世界上的存在，并获得观测点去观察它实际是什么以及真正发生了什么。</p>
<p>Within this book, We are not giving you all the answers. We are not telling you everything, for there are certain things that you must find out about on your own. For We do not want to engender belief. We want to engender Knowledge.</p>
<p>在这本书中，我们不会给你所有的答案。我们不会告诉你一切，因为有些事情你必须自己去发现。因为我们不想灌输信仰。我们想要产生内识。</p>
<p>It is enough for you to know that you have competitors in the world who are vying for control of this world, who are establishing influence here and who are fulfilling their own objectives and mandates in doing this. They are not part of your spiritual cosmology. They are just sentient beings from another world. In fact, they represent several groups of sentient beings from other worlds who are here to find resources and establish alliances.</p>
<p>你只需知道，你们在世界上有竞争对手，他们在争夺对这个世界的控制权，他们在这里建立影响力，他们这样做是为了实现他们自己的目标和使命。他们不是你们精神宇宙观的一部分。他们只是来自另一个世界的有情生命。事实上，他们代表了来自其他世界的有情生命群体，他们来这里是为了寻找资源和建立联盟。</p>
<p>To know more, you must go deeper yourself. We open the door, but you must go through. It is not necessary for you to know their names or what world they come from. That would be meaningless at this point. This information is reserved for the serious student of Knowledge.</p>
<p>要想知道更多，你必须深入你自己。我们打开门，但你必须通过。你没有必要知道他们的名字或他们来自哪个世界。它在这一点上毫无意义。这个信息是为认真学习内识的人保留的。</p>
<p>Why do We withhold this information? Because We value your integrity, and We want you to develop your integrity. We value your potential for honesty, and We want you to develop your honesty. We value your strength and your determination, and We want you to develop your strength and determination. Otherwise, you would read this book and have a whole new set of things to believe in. But belief is not what We are seeking to engender or to embellish here.</p>
<p>我们为什么要隐瞒这些信息？因为我们重视你的完整性，我们希望你培养你的完整性。我们重视你诚实的潜力，我们希望你培养你的诚实。我们重视你的力量和决心，我们希望你培养你的力量和决心。否则，你读了这本书，就会有一整套你相信的事情。但信念并不是我们在这里寻求产生或美化的。</p>
<p>You need a certain perspective, that is true. You need a certain orientation to be looking in the right direction. We are pointing in the right direction. We are giving you the orientation. But you must make the journey. It is not enough simply to know about the presence of the Greater Community or to accept the possibility that they are here. You must come to know what this really means.</p>
<p>你需要一定的视角，这是真实的。你需要一定的定位来朝着正确的方向看。我们正指向正确的方向。我们正给你定位。但你必须踏上旅程。仅仅知道大社区的存在或接受他们在这里的可能性是不够的。你必须知道这真正意味着什么。</p>
<p>We are promoting Knowledge, not ideas alone, but ideas are necessary to take you to Knowledge, to aim you in the right direction, to bring you to the threshold of Knowledge. That is the greatest service ideas can provide for you. But beyond this threshold, ideas cannot go. You venture [forth] without a solid construct of ideas into the pure realm of experience in Knowledge.</p>
<p>我们推广的是内识，而不仅仅是想法，但想法对于引领你走向内识、指引你走向正确方向、引领你到达内识的门槛是必不可少的。这是想法能为你提供的最大服务。但越过这个门槛，想法是无法继续前行的。你将不再依赖想法的构建，勇敢地进入内识的纯粹体验领域。</p>
<p>To get there, you must become really honest with yourself. This is necessary to engage in the process of discerning what you want from what you know. You may be well acquainted with what you want, but do you know what you really want? Do you know what is really essential for your Being? Do you know what has brought you into the world? Do you know what you must fulfill here?</p>
<p>要做到这一点，你必须对你自己真正诚实。这对于从已知中辨别出你想要什么是必不可少的。你可能很清楚你想要什么，但你知道你真正想要什么吗？你知道什么对你的存在是真正重要吗？你知道是什么把你带到这个世界上吗？你知道你必须在这里实现什么吗？</p>
<p>You may have ideas about these things, but do you really know? You may say, “Well, I am here to bring peace. I am here to help people,” but these are only generalizations. Your purpose in coming here is more specific than that. Your mission in being here is more specific than that.</p>
<p>你可能对这些事情有一些想法，但你真的知道吗？你可能会说：“好吧，我来这里是为了带来和平。我来这里是为了帮助人们。”但这些只是泛泛而谈。你来这里的目的比这更具体。你来这里的使命比这更具体。</p>
<p>We know you do not yet know these things fully. If you are honest with yourself, you will recognize you do not yet know these things. That is good. It is good to be so honest. It is good to have an honest evaluation. It is good to know what you know and what you do not know. Maybe you only know a few little things. Maybe you only have a few pieces to the puzzle, a few clues to the mystery, but that is enough to begin.</p>
<p>我们知道你还不完全知道这些事情。如果你对你自己诚实，你就会认识到你还不知道这些事情。这很好。如此诚实是件好事。诚实地评价是件好事。知道你知道什么和不知道什么是件好事。也许你只知道一些小事。也许你只有拼图的几块碎片，只有一些谜团的线索，但这足以开始。</p>
<p>The problem is when people think they know what they really do not know because they cannot distinguish between their ideas and what is truly known within them. They cannot distinguish between their thinking mind and their knowing Mind.</p>
<p>问题在于，当人们认为他们知道他们实际不知道的事情时，他们无法区分他们的想法和他们内心真正知道的内识。他们无法区分他们的思维心灵和他们的知道心灵。</p>
<p>Some people say, “Well, I am very intuitive,” but that is not it. Being intuitive is simply being more sensitive. It does not mean you have found the reality of Knowledge within yourself. It does not mean that you have come close enough to Knowledge to know what Knowledge is and what it is attempting to do in your life. You have not come close enough to realize that what Knowledge is and who you really are, are the same.</p>
<p>有些人说：“好吧，我很有直觉”，但事实并非如此。直觉只是更敏感而已。这并不意味着你已经找到了你内在内识的现实。这并不意味着你已经足够接近内识，知道内识是什么，以及它试图在你的生命中做什么。你还没有足够接近内识，以至于意识到内识是什么和你真正是谁是相同的。</p>
<p>These realizations all represent tremendous thresholds in The Way of Knowledge. Anyone who takes the Steps to Knowledge will be approaching these thresholds, and there are more than one of them. Each threshold will require a greater honesty and a clearer self-evaluation.</p>
<p>这些领悟都代表着内识之路上极大的门槛。任何开展内识进阶的人都将接近这些门槛，而且不止一个。每个门槛都需要更大的诚实和更清晰的自我评估。</p>
<p>At the outset, there is considerable confusion, for though you know something that is real within you and you know there is something important for you to do in life, you do not want to be superstitious. You do not want to have wild ideas. You do not want your approach to be merely self-seeking. You do not want to be governed by fear or ambition.</p>
<p>一开始，你会感到相当困惑，因为尽管你知道你内心真实的内识，你知道生命中有些重要的事情要做，但你不想迷信。你不想有疯狂的想法。你不想让你的做法只是自私自利。你不想被恐惧或野心所支配。</p>
<p>So you are unsure that you are doing the right thing, and you do not know where it is taking you, and you do not know what it will require, but you have the honesty. You have the response to yourself, the response-ability to Knowledge, to take the next step. Knowledge only asks you to take the next step. It does not ask you to realize what you cannot realize, to accomplish what you cannot yet accomplish or to become what you cannot yet become. It only asks you to take the next step.</p>
<p>所以你不确定你是否在做正确的事情，你不知道它会把你带向何方，你不知道它会要求你做什么，但你有诚实。你有对你自己的回应，有对内识的回应能力，可以迈出下一步。内识只要求你迈出下一步。它不要求你去实现你无法实现的事情，去完成你还无法完成的事情，去成为你还无法成为的人。它只要求你迈出下一步。</p>
<p>For many people, though, they do not have the self-confidence to simply take the next step. They want to know the whole picture, and since Knowledge will not reveal it all to them, they invent it for themselves, or they garner it from other people’s inventions. They fill in all the spaces with their ideas and their beliefs until they have a complete explanation.</p>
<p>然而，对于许多人来说，他们没有足够的自信迈出下一步。他们想知道整个画面，而由于内识不会向他们揭示一切，他们就为他们自己发明，或者从他人的发明中获取。他们用他们的想法和他们的信念填补所有的空白，直到他们有一个完整的解释。</p>
<p>Perhaps you have done this yourself to a certain degree. You can certainly remember talking to someone who seemed to have all the answers, but did they really know? Perhaps they were very firm in their conviction, perhaps they felt very strongly about what they were seeing and feeling, but did they really know? Were they honest enough with themselves to know the difference between what they believed and what they know?</p>
<p>也许你自己也在某种程度上这样做过。你一定记得曾经与某个似乎知道所有答案的人交谈过，但他们真的知道吗？也许他们对自己的看法非常坚定，也许他们对自己所见所感的感觉非常强烈，但他们真的知道吗？他们对他们自己是否足够诚实，知道他们所相信的和他们所知道的之间的区别？</p>
<p>You will be with people who even say, “I know this to be true! This is the truth. I know it!” But if you reflect upon this carefully, you might see that they really do not know it, but they defend their ideas even with their life. People will lay down their lives for their ideas, can you imagine? Sacrifice your life for an idea?</p>
<p>你会和这样的人在一起，他们甚至会说：“我知道这是真实的！这是真理。我知道它！”但如果你仔细思考一下，你可能会发现他们其实并不知道，但他们甚至会用生命来捍卫他们的想法。人们会为他们的想法献出生命，你能想象吗？为了想法而牺牲生命？</p>
<p>To lay down your life for something real and genuine and permanent, yes, that may have merit under extreme circumstances, but to lay down your life for an idea? Unless that idea is imbued with Knowledge, it does not have reality. Even if everyone believes in it and relies upon it, without Knowledge, it does not have reality.</p>
<p>为了某种真实、真正和永恒的事物献出生命，是的，这在极端情况下可能是有价值的，但为了某个想法而牺牲生命呢？除非这个想法充满了内识，否则它就不具备现实性。即使每个人都相信它、依赖它，但如果没有内识，它就不具有现实性。</p>
<p>These things that I am speaking of represent realizations. Each realization is a threshold in and of itself, but over the course of life there are great thresholds over which you must pass if you are to fully realize who you are and why you are here.</p>
<p>我所说的这些事情代表着领悟。每一次领悟本身就是一道门槛，但在生命的历程中，如果你要充分领悟你是谁以及你为何在这里，你必须跨越许多伟大的门槛。</p>
<p>These great thresholds require tremendous self-evaluation and re-evaluation. They take honesty to a whole new level, for it is not enough to admit to what you think or feel or believe. The great honesty is feeling what you know. It is being united with what you know. To become united with what you know, you must become aware of what you know. You must accept what you know. You must discern what you know from the other preoccupations in your mind, from the other forces in your mind and from all of the persuasion and conditioning that have shaped you and formed you thus far.</p>
<p>这些伟大门槛要求极大的自我评估和重新评估。它们将诚实提升到一个全新的水平，因为仅仅承认你所想、所感或所信是不够的。伟大的诚实是感受你所知道的内识。它是与你所知道的统一。为了与你所知道的统一，你必须察觉你所知道的内识。你必须接受你所知道的内识。你必须从你心灵中的其他先入之见、从你心灵中的其他力量、从迄今为止塑造和形成你的所有说服和制约中辨别你所知道的内识。</p>
<p>Here there is a tremendous process of sorting out. It is like going through your closet at home with a commitment to only keep what is really being used and is really useful and is really valuable. Everything else, you get rid of. And you might end up with a pretty empty closet, but that creates space for new things to happen.</p>
<p>这里有一个庞大的整理过程。它就像在家里整理衣柜，承诺只保留真正有用、实际使用和真正有价值的衣服。其他衣服都会被丢弃。最后你可能会得到一个空衣柜，但这为新的事物的出现创造了空间。</p>
<p>When you learn to sort out your mind, which can only be done in stages, you create a lot of space in your mind. Your mind is no longer filled to the brim with ideas and beliefs and memories. You have sorted things out because at every threshold you must sort things out even more. And in practicing The Way of Knowledge, you learn to become still while over time things that are not real or are not meaningful to you now just fall away. This creates a lot of space and openness in the mind, a lot of space and openness for Knowledge to fill.</p>
<p>当你学会整理你的心灵时，这只能分阶段完成，你会在心灵中创造很多空间。你的心灵不再被想法、信念和记忆填满。你已经理清了一切，因为在每个门槛上你都必须更加理清一切。在实践内识之路时，你会学会保持静止，而随着时间的推移，那些不真实或对你没有意义的事物就会消失。这在心灵中创造了大量的空间和开放性，大量的空间和开放性可以让内识来填补。</p>
<p>It is a sobering realization at the outset that for the beginning student of Knowledge—and everyone who begins the preparation in Knowledge is a beginning student of Knowledge—much of what you believe, much of what you idealize and much of what you give your energy to are really not that important.</p>
<p>它是一个令人警醒的认知，即对于刚开始学习内识的学生来说——每个开始进行内识准备的人都是刚开始学习内识的学生——你所相信的许多事物、你所理想化的事物以及你为之付出精力的事物，其实并没有那么重要。</p>
<p>The sense of loss that this can engender can be immediately offset by the fact that you will have an opportunity to get in touch with what is really important, to feel what is really meaningful, to identify what is really valuable. It is by doing this that you finally begin to experience yourself as being meaningful. You start to experience yourself as being valuable, for your experience of yourself is the result of what you identify with and give yourself to.</p>
<p>由此产生的失落感可以立即被这样一个事实抵消：你将有机会接触真正重要的内识，感受真正有意义的内识，识别真正有价值的内识。正是通过这样做，你最终开始体验到你自己是有意义的。你开始体验到你自己是有价值的，因为你对你自己的体验是你认同和给予你自己的结果。</p>
<p>If you give yourself to little things, you will feel little. If you give yourself to great things, you will feel great. There is no way around this. If you are feeling inadequate, if your life feels inadequate, it is because you need to identify with greater things within yourself and give yourself to greater things in life. A simple prescription, but not easy to accomplish. Why is it not easy to accomplish? Because of this issue of honesty.</p>
<p>如果你把你自己奉献给小事，你就会觉得你是渺小的。如果你把你自己奉献给大事，你将感觉到伟大。这是无法避免的。如果你觉得你不够好，如果你觉得你的生命不够好，那是因为你需要认同你自己内心更伟大的事情，并把你自己奉献给生命中更伟大的事情。一个简单的处方，但并不容易实现。为什么它不容易实现？因为这是个诚实的问题。</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to realize that there are two minds within you. There is the mind with which you think and there is the Mind with which you know. Our emphasis is to bring your thinking mind together with the knowing Mind, in service to the knowing Mind, for this is the thinking mind’s true relationship with Knowledge. And this is what gives your thinking mind true efficacy and value.</p>
<p>这里有必要意识到，你内心有两个心灵。一种是你用来思考的心灵，另一个是你用来知道的心灵。我们的重点是将你的思考心灵与知道心灵结合起来，为知道的心灵服务，因为这是思考的心灵与内识的真实关系。这才是让你的思考心灵真正有效和有价值的原因。</p>
<p>But until Knowledge is discovered, the thinking mind seems to be the only mind, and it sets up a whole defense mechanism to protect itself from destruction, from uncertainty, from invalidation and from hopelessness. It is weak and fallible, and so it tries to build great defenses against life. But this is not who you really are.</p>
<p>但在发现内识之前，思维的心灵似乎是唯一的心灵，它建立了一整套防御机制来保护它自己免受破坏、不确定性、无效性和绝望。它是软弱的，容易犯错，所以它试图建立强大的防御来对抗生命。但这不是你的真正身份。</p>
<p>You need the thinking mind to negotiate the physical world and to function within the mental environment, but the thinking mind is really a mechanism to serve a greater Mind and reality within you. As you learn to identify with the greater reality, you learn to see that the mind is a medium. You learn to see that it is a temporary thing. It is not eternal, and it is only relevant to your life here in this world at this time.</p>
<p>你需要用思维心灵来应对物质世界并在心理环境中运作，但思维心灵其实是一种服务于你内心更伟大心灵和现实的机制。当你学会认同更伟大的现实时，你就会学会看到心灵是一种媒介。你学会看到它是一种暂时的事物。它不是永恒的，它只与你此时此刻在这个世界的生命有关。</p>
<p>When you leave this world and return to your Spiritual Family, you will not need this thinking mind, but right now you do need a thinking mind. So the important question is, “What does this thinking mind serve?” It either serves itself or it serves someone else or it serves the greater power of Knowledge, for the thinking mind can only serve.</p>
<p>当你离开这个世界，回到你的精神家庭时，你将不再需要这个思维的心灵，但此刻你确实需要一个思维的心灵。因此，重要的问题是，“这个思维的心灵服务于什么？”它要么服务于它自己，要么服务于他人，要么服务于内识的更伟大力量，因为思维的心灵只能服务。</p>
<p>This is a great truth in The Way of Knowledge and a liberating one at that, for with this understanding, you can shift the allegiance of your mind. By shifting the allegiance of your mind, you realize that you are not your mind, that you are greater than your mind. How can the mind be changed if it is all that you are?</p>
<p>这是内识之路中的一个伟大真理，也是一个解放人心的真理，因为有了这种理解，你就可以改变你心灵的效忠对象。通过改变你心灵的效忠对象，你会意识到你不是你的心灵，你比你的心灵更伟大。如果心灵就是你的全部，那又如何能改变心灵呢？</p>
<p>Your mind will be transformed as you learn The Way of Knowledge. It will not be denied. It will not be repudiated. It will not be destroyed. It will not be condemned or maligned. It will be re-employed. It will be transformed. It will become a great instrument of communication. That is the ultimate purpose and value of the mind.</p>
<p>当你学习内识之路时，你的心灵将会发生转变。它不会被否认。它不会被否定。它不会被摧毁。它不会被谴责或诽谤。它将被重新雇佣。它将被转变。它将成为一个伟大的沟通工具。这是心灵的终极目的和价值。</p>
<p>When the mind serves the Spirit, then the body can serve the Spirit and everything serves the Spirit. This is a complete transformation of your experience.</p>
<p>当心灵服务于精神时，身体才能服务于精神，一切都服务于精神。这是你体验的彻底转变。</p>
<p>Its fundamental reality is honesty. You can be honest to your mind. You can be honest to another person and their mind. But can you be honest to Knowledge? This means that what you say and what you think and what you do, do not violate Knowledge.</p>
<p>其根本现实是诚实。你可以诚实对待你的心灵。你可以诚实对待他人和他们的心灵。但你能诚实对待内识吗？这意味着你所说、所想和所为不会违背内识。</p>
<p>The only way you can have this experience is to follow the Steps to Knowledge, learn to receive Knowledge and to experience Knowledge and learn to recognize what Knowledge really is and why it is here. There is no other way.</p>
<p>你能拥有这种体验的唯一方式是遵循内识进阶，学习接收内识、体验内识，学习认识内识到底是什么以及它为何在这里。没有其他方式。</p>
<p>Fundamentally, all religious practice, all spiritual focus must be on the reclamation of Knowledge. We put it into these terms so that you may understand it more clearly and may see it without all of the conditions and preoccupations of religion as it has come to be known within your world.</p>
<p>从根本上讲，所有宗教实践、所有精神焦点都必须放在恢复内识上。我们这样表述，是为了使你能够更清楚地理解它，能够抛开你们世界已知的宗教的所有条件和偏见来看待它。</p>
<p>Raw spirituality is Knowledge. The essence of spiritual life is living a life of Knowledge. Here what you believe, what you think, how you evaluate, what you perceive, what you choose become a great instrument of Knowledge within you. Here your true Self emerges and is able to use the vehicle of your mind and the vehicle of your body to give great things into the world. Then when you are done, you go home to your Spiritual Family and you are done.</p>
<p>未加工的精神性就是内识。精神生命的本质是过一种内识的生活。在这里，你的信念、你的思考、你的评价、你的感知、你的选择都成为你内在内识的伟大工具。在这里，你的真实自我浮现出来，能够使用你的心灵和身体为世界创造伟大的事物。然后，当你完成这一切后，你就可以回到你的精神家庭，你就完成了。</p>
<p>The world’s teaching about spiritual enlightenment is full of error. While it is true there must be great breakthroughs in life, and this might represent an enlightening experience, the true state of enlightenment is beyond the world.</p>
<p>世人对精神启蒙的教导充满了错误。虽然生命中确实需要有重大突破，这可能代表一种启蒙体验，但真实的启蒙状态超越了世界。</p>
<p>You are here to contribute, not to gain rewards for yourself, but you will receive great rewards as you find the nature of your contribution and learn how to experience it and express it with wisdom in life.</p>
<p>你来这里是为了贡献，而不是为了你自己获取回报，但是当你找到你贡献的自然并学会如何在生命中体验它并用智慧表达它时，你将获得伟大的回报。</p>
<p>What is enlightenment in the world? Even if you were able to grow beyond all of the limitations of human experience, you would still be a beginner in the Greater Community. That is like graduating from middle school and going to high school. Yes, you have graduated, but you now find yourself in a new class, where you are the beginner.</p>
<p>世间的开悟是什么？即使你能够超越人类经验的所有局限，你仍然是大社区的初学者。它就像初中毕业后上高中一样。是的，你已经毕业了，但现在你发现你自己身处一个新的班级，你还是一名初学者。</p>
<p>That is why We are teaching The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, because you need an education in both worldly spirituality and Greater Community Spirituality. There is only one Teaching that can prepare you for this and give you this education together, and they must go together now because the world is emerging into a Greater Community.</p>
<p>这就是为什么我们教授大社区内识之路，因为你既需要世俗精神性方面的教育，也需要大社区精神性的教育。只有一个教导能够让你为此做好准备，并同时给予你这种教育，它们现在必须结合在一起，因为世界正在迈向一个大社区。</p>
<p>Human wisdom alone is not enough. Learning how to function in human affairs wisely, though highly valuable and rarely achieved, is not enough, for humanity is no longer alone. This is its great problem. This is its great opportunity. This is its great requirement. This is its great need.</p>
<p>仅凭人类智慧是不够的。学会如何明智地处理人类事务，尽管非常有价值，而且很难做到，但还不够，因为人类不再孤单。这是人类的伟大问题。这是人类的伟大机会。这是人类的伟大要求。这是人类的伟大需求。</p>
<p>As you read this book, it will be an exercise in honesty for you. Let Us clarify what this means. Real honesty is being accountable to Knowledge. Yet because Knowledge is so unknown within the world, this is a very difficult definition to use. You might read this book and think, “I can’t relate to this. I don’t relate to these ideas. I don’t agree with these ideas.”</p>
<p>当你阅读这本书时，这对你来说将是一次诚实的练习。让我们来解释一下这是什么意思。真正的诚实是对内识负责。然而，由于内识在世界上是如此未知，所以这是一个很难使用的定义。你可能会读这本书，然后想，“我无法理解这一点。我不认同这些想法。我不同意这些想法。”</p>
<p>Some people will read this book and have that response. They will say, “ I don’t agree with this. I don’t relate to this,” but what are they really saying? What they are really saying is that they cannot relate their old ideas to this new information. They are saying, “This new information does not correlate with my current ideas or with my current experience.”</p>
<p>有些人读了这本书后会有这样的反应。他们会说：“我不同意这个想法。我与此无关。”但他们真正想说的是什么呢？他们真正想说的是，他们无法将他们的旧想法与这些新的信息联系起来。他们说：“这些新信息与我现在的想法或我目前的经历无关。”</p>
<p>This should be a motivation to discover. This should be a motivation to move into new territory to learn new things. But what usually happens is people use this as an excuse to dismiss the new information, to prevent themselves from having the new experience. Instead of saying, “I need to learn this. I haven’t learned this yet, and I need to learn this,” they say, “Well, I don’t relate to this,” and so they pass it by.</p>
<p>这应该是探索的动力。这应该是进入新领域学习新事物的动力。但通常的情况是，人们以此为借口拒绝新信息，阻止他们自己获得新的体验。他们不会说：“我需要学习这个。我还没有学过这个，我需要学习这个”，而是说：“好吧，我与这个无关”，所以他们就放弃了。</p>
<p>Being accountable to your ideas is not honesty. That is deception. You must be accountable to something greater within you, which will motivate you to go beyond your ideas, to outgrow them if it is necessary.</p>
<p>对你的想法负责并不是诚实。它是欺骗。你必须对你内心更伟大的内识负责，这会激励你超越你的想法，在必要时超越它们。</p>
<p>We are presenting a New Revelation in this book—a new spirituality; a new experience of being alive in the world; a new foundation for experiencing certainty, strength and wisdom. We are not here to embellish what has already been learned. We are not here to validate everything that is being believed in the world. We are here to provide a New Revelation and all that that entails. It is a Revelation based upon reality, not upon hope and fear. It is a Revelation based upon what is actually occurring within the world, not upon human ideals or human anxieties.</p>
<p>我们在这本书中呈现了一种新的启示——一种新的精神性；一种活在世上的新体验；一种体验确定性、力量和智慧的新基础。我们来这里不是为了美化已经学到的东西。我们来这里不是为了证实世界上所有被相信的事情。我们来这里是为了提供一种新的启示以及它所包含的一切。这是一种基于现实而不是希望和恐惧的启示。这是一种基于世界上实际发生的事情而不是人类理想或人类焦虑的启示。</p>
<p>So if someone reads these words and says, “Well, I don’t relate to this. I don’t agree with this,” We say, “That is fine. Take the next step.” We do not expect people to believe everything We are saying, but We want to give them the opportunity to experience it for themselves. It is the experience that counts. If people believe in what We are saying but do not know it, it is not worth anything. It is no good. Yes, it may bring them to a greater realization, but they must go beyond their ideas to enter into this realization.</p>
<p>因此，如果有人读到这些话，说：“好吧，我与此无关。我不同意这一点。”我们会说：“没关系。继续下一步。”我们并不期望人们相信我们所说的一切，但我们希望给他们机会亲身体验。重要的是体验。如果人们相信我们所说的话，但却不知道它，那就一文不值。这毫无用处。是的，这可能会让他们获得更大的领悟，但他们必须超越他们的想法才能获得这种领悟。</p>
<p>We are talking about honesty here—a greater honesty than what people usually think of when they think of honesty. When people think of honesty, they think of revealing what they think or revealing what they have done. That is only the beginning. Those are only the baby steps in honesty.</p>
<p>我们在这里谈论的是诚实——一种比人们通常认为的诚实更伟大的诚实。当人们想到诚实时，他们会想到透露他们的想法或透露他们所做的事情。这只是开始。这些只是诚实的初级阶段。</p>
<p>If you encounter something new in life, then you must go deep within yourself and ask yourself, “Is this important for me to learn?” And you must not listen to your mind, for your mind will simply reassert its old ideas. You must listen deeper. You must listen at the level of your heart, your Being. This is honesty.</p>
<p>如果你在生命中遇到新的事物，那么你必须深入你自己的内心，问你自己：“学习这个对我重要吗？”你一定不能听从你的心灵，因为你的心灵只会重申它旧的想法。你必须更深入地聆听。你必须在你的内心层面聆听，你的存在。这就是诚实。</p>
<p>You might find that you need to do something you do not want to do. You might find you need to learn something that is in contrast or in conflict with your current ideas or beliefs. You might find that you need to experience something you have never experienced before.</p>
<p>你可能会发现你需要做一些你不想做的事情。你可能会发现你需要学习一些与你当前的想法或信念相反或相冲突的事情。你可能会发现你需要体验一些你从未经历过的事情。</p>
<p>When people encounter something new and they say, “Oh, I don’t relate to this,” they are simply shutting the door on it. They are not asking the deeper question. They are not really reflecting upon it. They are simply following the dictates of their thinking mind in the moment.</p>
<p>当人们遇到新的事物并说：“哦，我与此无关”时，他们只是将其拒之门外。他们没有提出更深层次的问题。他们并没有真正思考它。他们只是在遵循他们当时思维的指示。</p>
<p>Their thinking mind is not interested in a greater education. It is primarily concerned with its own survival because without Knowledge, it is afraid and it is vulnerable in the world. What the thinking mind really needs is Knowledge because this is its real foundation. This is what it is meant to serve. But without Knowledge, it can only serve its own interests, which are primarily concerned with protecting itself.</p>
<p>他们的思维心灵对更伟大的教育不感兴趣。它主要关心的是它自己的生存，因为没有内识，它就会感到恐惧，在世界上就会变得脆弱。思维心灵真正需要的是内识，因为这是它真正的基础。这就是它应该服务的内识。但是没有内识，它只能服务于它自己的利益，而它自己的利益主要关心的是保护它自己。</p>
<p>That is why the thinking mind without Knowledge is primarily governed by fear. It gains its stability by the strength of its ideas and by its convictions concerning its ideas. Though this gives it reprieve from its own anxiety, it does not open the way for its liberation.</p>
<p>这就是为什么没有内识的思维心灵主要受恐惧支配。它通过想法的力量和对想法的信念获得稳定性。虽然这可以缓解它自身的焦虑，但并不能为它的解放开辟道路。</p>
<p>Some people might read this book and say, “Well, I can relate to what is being said, but I do not understand.” We say, “That is good.” Real understanding is the result of real preparation and participation. The real answer to the great questions is not a set of words or an idea. It is a means for finding out.</p>
<p>有些人读了这本书可能会说：“好吧，我能理解书中所说的内容，但我理解。”我们会说：“这很好。”真正的理解是真正的准备和参与的结果。对伟大问题的真正答案不是一组词语或一个想法。它是一种寻找答案的方法。</p>
<p>You will need to find out what the Greater Community is. You need to find out what Knowledge is. You need to find out what following The Way of Knowledge, learning The Way of Knowledge and taking the Steps to Knowledge [means]. You must find these things out for yourself. You must make the journey. The journey is what matters.</p>
<p>你需要弄清楚大社区是什么。你需要弄清楚内识是什么。你需要弄清楚遵循内识之路、学习内识之路和开展内识进阶[意味着什么]。你必须自己去发现这些事情。你必须踏上旅程。旅程才是最重要的。</p>
<p>People want answers because they are lazy, because they do not want to take a journey. They simply want to fortify their ideas. Their mind is like a prison, and they want to add more bricks and mortar to it. They want to make the walls thicker, stronger, to keep the world out. But they pay the price by keeping themselves in. Their ideas are like a great buffer.</p>
<p>人们想要答案是因为他们懒惰，因为他们不想踏上旅程。他们只是想巩固他们的想法。他们的心灵就像一座监狱，他们想在里面加更多的砖块和灰泥。他们想把墙弄得更厚、更坚固，把世界拒之门外。但他们付出了代价，把他们自己关在了里面。他们的想法就像一个巨大的缓冲器。</p>
<p>This is not a proper use of the mind. This is not utilizing intelligence. This is not being intelligent. Remember, intelligence is the willingness, the desire and the ability to adapt and to create. To create, you must adapt, which means you must change and grow, which means your thoughts must be changeable. No matter how useful they may seem at the moment, they must be changeable, and you must be able to change them. If they are fixed like concrete, then they will bind you, they will imprison you, they will prevent you from seeing and knowing what you really want to see and know.</p>
<p>这不是对心灵的正确使用。这不是在善用智能。这不是聪慧。记住，智能是适应和创造的意愿、愿望和能力。要创造，你必须适应，这意味着你必须改变和成长，这意味着你的思想必须是可变的。无论它们现在看起来多么有用，它们必须是可变的，你必须能够改变它们。如果它们像混凝土一样固定，那么它们就会束缚你，囚禁你，阻止你看到和知道你真正想看到和知道的内识。</p>
<p>The mind must be stirred constantly because it is like concrete. If you stop stirring the concrete and adding the water, it hardens and then you cannot work with it. People’s minds become like hardened concrete. You cannot work with them. They are entirely fixed in the way they think.</p>
<p>必须不断搅动心灵，因为它就像混凝土。如果你停止搅拌混凝土和加水，它就会变硬，然后你就无法使用心灵。人们的心灵变得像硬化的混凝土。你无法与他们合作。他们的思考方式完全固定。</p>
<p>Their Beings are prisoners within their own creation. They have walled themselves in. They cannot hear the Creator speaking to them now. They can only hear their own thoughts. They cannot hear the deeper minds of others calling to them. They can only hear their own thoughts. They cannot face life as it really is. They can only see life according to what their mind will reveal to them. They are slaves to what should serve them, for the real purpose and function of the mind is to serve the Being, is to serve Knowledge. For them, honesty is simply being obedient to their ideas, being consistent in their thinking.</p>
<p>他们的存在是他们自己创造的囚徒。他们把他们自己封闭起来。他们现在听不到造物主对他们讲话。他们只能听到他们自己的思想。他们听不到他人更深层次的心灵在召唤他们。他们只能听到他们自己的思想。他们无法面对生命的实际样子。他们只能根据他们的心灵向他们揭示的生命来看待生命。他们是应该为他们服务的心灵的奴隶，因为心灵的真正目的和功能是服务于存在，服务于内识。对他们来说，诚实只是服从他们的想法，在思维上保持一致。</p>
<p>Take to heart what We are telling you here. Ask yourself deeply what is important, but do not be satisfied with immediate answers, for you must go deeper. You must stop living at the surface of your mind and penetrate to its depth, to its core, for that is where the reality is. What is at the surface of the mind is layers and layers of conditioning—walls, blocks, shields, scar tissue. The mind is like a machine at its surface until it has become liberated by Knowledge.</p>
<p>牢记我们在这里告诉你的话。深刻地问问你自己什么是重要的，但不要满足于立即的答案，因为你必须走得更远。你必须停止生活在心灵的表面，深入到它的深处，深入到它的核心，因为那里才是现实所在。心灵的表面是一层又一层的制约——墙壁、障碍、盾牌、疤痕组织。心灵就像一台机器，在它的表面，直到它被内识解放。</p>
<p>That is why many people act and react in predictable ways. They are governed by forces they do not even recognize. They never think to question their ideas. They never think to really question their values. They do not want to deal with the uncertainty of doing so. They do not want to risk what they have even though they have so little.</p>
<p>这就是为什么许多人的行为和反应都是可预测的。他们被他们甚至无法识别的力量所支配。他们从未想过要质疑他们的想法。他们从未想过要真正质疑他们的价值观。他们不想处理这样做的不确定性。他们不想拿他们己拥有的东西冒险，尽管他们拥有的很少。</p>
<p>When you are honest with yourself, this means being honest with Knowledge. If you do not know what Knowledge is, then you must find the way to Knowledge. You find the way to Knowledge by calling upon Knowledge, by going beyond your thoughts and beliefs, going beyond what you can relate to or what you believe in or what you have experienced thus far.</p>
<p>当你对你自己诚实时，这意味着对内识诚实。如果你不知道内识是什么，那么你必须找到通往内识的道路。通过召唤内识，通过超越你的思想和信仰，超越你所能联系到的、你所相信的或你迄今为止所体验到的，你就能找到通往内识的道路。</p>
<p>The preparation in Steps to Knowledge will enable you to do this, for it does not appeal to your beliefs about certainty, strength and wisdom. It teaches you how to appeal to Knowledge. This is different from seeking some psychic force outside yourself. This is different from opening your mind to whoever wants to dominate it in the mental environment. This is coming home to Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>内识进阶中的准备将使你能够做到这一点，因为它并不迎合你对确定性、力量和智慧的信念。它教你如何求助于内识。这不同于在你自身之外寻求某种通灵势力。这不同于在心理环境中向任何想要支配你的人开放你的心灵。这是回归你自己内在的内识。</p>
<p>Being true to yourself means being true to Knowledge, to what is deeply known, to what is the real meaning and current of your life. You can only develop this ability by taking the Steps to Knowledge, by opening your mind so that Knowledge can emerge there, by learning to still the mind so that you can learn to see through its mechanisms, by learning how to direct the mind and to develop its great capacities.</p>
<p>忠于你自己意味着忠于内识，忠于深刻知道的内识，忠于你生命的真正意义和潮流。你只有通过内识的进阶，通过打开你的心灵让内识浮现，通过学习让心灵静止以便你能够学会看透它的机制，通过学习如何引导心灵并开发它的伟大能力，才能发展这种能力。</p>
<p>Here the mind learns to serve. Here it gives up its pretense of being the master. Here the whole pursuit of mastery changes, for in the world there are no masters. This is true because in the Greater Community, there are no masters. This is true because Knowledge is the master. It is the master in you. It is the master that the Master Creator has placed within you. It is your connection to God, to divinity, to truth, to purpose, to everything that is meaningful in life.</p>
<p>在这里，心灵学会服务。在这里，它放弃了做主人的伪装。在这里，对主人的整个追求都发生了改变，因为这个世界上没有主人。这是真实的，因为在大社区里没有主人。这是真实的，因为内识就是主人。它是你内在的主人。它是造物主大师置于你内在的主人。它是你与上帝、与神性、与真理、与宗旨、与生命中一切有意义的事物的联接。</p>
<p>How can you be the master when Knowledge is the master? You can only express the master. You can only accept the master. You can only let the master transform you, revitalize you and redirect your life. This is mastery in a real sense, but it is a very humble form of mastery.</p>
<p>当内识是主人时，你怎么能成为主人呢？你只能表达主人。你只能接受主人。你只能让主人改变你、振兴你并重新引导你的生命。这是真正意义上的主人，但它是一种非常谦逊的主人形式。</p>
<p>This is being honest. This is knowing what is great and what is small. Your body is small. Your mind is small. Your Being is great. We are bringing you to what is great so that what is small may have real expression. Then the body becomes greater and the mind becomes greater because they represent something greater. They demonstrate something greater. They are the vehicles for something greater.</p>
<p>这就是诚实。这就是知道什么是伟大，什么是渺小。你的身体是渺小的。你的心灵是渺小的。你的存在是伟大的。我们带你走向伟大的内识，以便渺小的事物能够得到真正的表达。然后身体变得更伟大，心灵变得更伟大，因为它们代表着更伟大的内识。它们展示更伟大的内识。它们是更伟大内识的载体。</p>
<p>This is what is needed in the world, and this is what is needed in the Greater Community. This is what will give humanity strength and preeminence in the Greater Community. It will not be your technology, for that is still in very primitive stages of development. It will be something greater, something more important.</p>
<p>这是世界所需要的，这是大社区所需要的。这是将赋予人类力量和大社区卓越性的内识。它不会是你们的技术，因为技术仍处于非常原始的发展阶段。它将是一种更伟大、更重要的内识。</p>
<p>What is technology in the Greater Community? Eventually, you reach the limits of what you can do technologically, for there are limits. Then you try to develop strength in the mental environment, which is a great, great environment.</p>
<p>大社区里的科技是什么？最终，你们会达到科技所能做到的极限，因为科技是有极限的。然后你努力在心理环境中发展力量，这是一个非常非常伟大的环境。</p>
<p>But without Knowledge, you still do not have a great foundation. You still cannot discern the truth. You still cannot know fully what you are doing or the meaning of things. We are giving you this Greater Community perspective so that you may gain a greater honesty within yourself, so that you may learn what being true to yourself really means, what it requires and how it can be achieved.</p>
<p>但没有内识，你依然没有一个伟大的基础。你依然无法辨别真理。你依然无法充分知道你在做什么或所做事情的意义。我们赋予你这个大社区视角，这样你就能在你自己内在获得一种更伟大的诚实，这样你就能够学习诚实面对你自己真正意味着什么、它需要什么以及如何实现它。</p>
<p>We are giving you a different vantage point from which to see—to see something you could not see before; to see what is there; to see beyond your fears and your wants and your preferences; to see beyond all of the social conditioning that has shaped you thus far; to see beyond the prevalent attitudes and the mythology of your age; to see with clear eyes, not anyone else’s eyes, but your eyes; to see with Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>我们正在为你提供一个不同的观测点，让你能够看到一些你以前无法看到的事情；看到那里有什么；超越你的恐惧、你的欲望和你的偏好；超越迄今为止塑造你的所有社会制约；超越你所在时代的流行态度和神话；用清澈的眼睛去看，不是用他人的眼睛，而是用你自己的眼睛去看；用你内在的内识去看。</p>
<p>Some people may read this book and say, “Well, I’m not getting enough information.” They think We are here to provide more for them to believe in. They are looking for information. They want facts and figures, dates and places. They want to know how many worlds in the Greater Community are inhabited; they want to know how many races have visited our world; they want to know their systems of propulsion; they want to know their names and their languages; they want information.</p>
<p>有些人读了这本书可能会说：“嗯，我得到的信息还不够。”他们认为我们来这里是为了给他们提供更多可以相信的信息。他们在寻找信息。他们想要事实和数据、日期和地点。他们想知道大社区里有多少个世界有人居住；他们想知道有多少种族访问过你们的世界；他们想知道他们的推进系统；他们想知道他们的名字和语言；他们想要信息。</p>
<p>This information will be useless if you do not have the Knowledge to recognize it and know what it means. Go into your library. There is more information there than you can possibly assimilate. There is so much information that people do not know what to do with it. There is so much information about the presence of the Greater Community—so many sightings, so much evidence. If you look for it, if you are open to finding it, it is there. The problem is that people do not know what to do with it. They cannot understand it. They do not know how to discern what it means. You could have a million sightings of Greater Community craft in your skies, but without Knowledge you would not know what it means.</p>
<p>如果你没有内识去认知它并知道它意味着什么，那么这些信息将毫无用处。走进你的图书馆。那里的信息比你所能吸收的还要多。有太多的信息以至于人们不知道该如何处理它们。有太多关于大社区存在的信息——如此多的目击，如此多的证据。如果你寻找它，如果你愿意寻找它，它就在那里。问题是人们不知道该如何处理它。他们无法理解它。他们不知道如何辨别它意味着什么。你可能在天空中看到一百万次大社区飞行器，但如果没有内识，你就不会知道它意味着什么。</p>
<p>Do not seek for information. That is not your need. We are giving you something of far greater value. We are giving you the key to realization, to understanding. Then when you look at the information, you can learn how to discern what it means. You can see beyond appearances. You can see beyond persuasion. You can see beyond manipulation—the manipulation of your governments, the manipulation of the religious institutions, the manipulation even of the Greater Community forces who are interacting with humanity at this time.</p>
<p>不要去寻求信息。那不是你的需要。我们在给你一些更有价值的东西。我们在给你实现和理解的钥匙。然后当你看信息的时候，你就能够学会如何辨别它的意义。你能够看透表象。你能够看透说服。你能够看透操纵——你们政府的操纵，宗教机构的操纵，甚至正在与人类互动的大社区势力的操纵。</p>
<p>If you want information, then you are not yet being honest with yourself. That is not your greater need. You need to have the ability to discern what you are looking at. You need to have the greater intelligence within you to know what trail to follow, what clues are important and how to put them together.</p>
<p>如果你想要信息，那么你还没有对你自己诚实。这不是你更伟大的需求。你需要有能力辨别你在看什么。你需要有更伟大的智能来知道要追随什么线索，哪些线索是重要的以及如何将它们组合在一起。</p>
<p>Yes, We know the names of the visitors. We know where they have come from. It would be utterly meaningless to you, a bunch of incomprehensible words. It is the relationship between them that is valuable. That is important. You can fill in the names later if it ever becomes necessary.</p>
<p>是的，我们知道来访者的名字。我们知道他们来自哪里。对你来说，这些话毫无意义，只是一堆无法理解的单词。他们之间的关系才是有价值的。这很重要。如果有必要，你可以稍后填写姓名。</p>
<p>You know people’s names. You know where they were born, some of them, but do you know who they really are? Do you know what their life is really about? Do you know what they are destined to do? Do you know their deeper inclinations? Do you know why they are here?</p>
<p>你知道人们的名字。你知道他们中的一些人出生在何处，但你知道他们真正是谁吗？你知道他们的生命真正是为了什么吗？你知道他们注定要做什么吗？你知道他们内心深处的倾向吗？你知道他们为什么在这里吗？</p>
<p>Therefore, consider the Greater Community and ask yourself these same questions. Either your mind will fill in the answers, you will get the answers from somewhere else, based upon someone else’s ideas, or you will find the way to Knowledge where you can know.</p>
<p>因此，思考一下大社区，问你自己同样的问题。要么你的心灵会填补答案，要么你会从别的地方得到答案，基于他人的想法，要么你会找到通往你可以知道的内识的道路。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge is the way of honesty, and it is the way of relationship. It is the way of gaining a greater participation and a greater perception and understanding of life. But beyond this, it is a complete transformation of your mind and your being in the world, for you have come to serve the world in its present needs and you have come to serve the world’s needs for its future. For you are here now and you are connected to its future.</p>
<p>内识之路是诚实之路，是关系之路。它是获得一种更伟大参与，一种更伟大感知和理解的生命之路。但除此之外，它还是你心灵和你在世界上存在的彻底转变，因为你来这里是为了服务世界当前的需求，你来这里是为了服务世界未来的需求。因为你现在就在这里，你与它的未来息息相关。</p>
