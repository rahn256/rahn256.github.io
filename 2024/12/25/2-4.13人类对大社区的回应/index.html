<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 5, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月5日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will take some time before people can become used to this idea of the Greater Community. It represents such a great threshold, such an enormous turning point for humanity. Some people will move towards it; some will move away from it; some will move against it. These are the three possible responses that any person can have to new ideas and to new experience. Within each of these three possible responses, there are several different manifestations. Let Us take a look now and see what each of these means, and where these responses come from within the person and within human society itself.</p>
<p>人们需要一段时间才能习惯大社区这个概念。它代表着人类的一个伟大门槛，一个伟大的转折点。有些人会走向它；有些人会远离它；有些人会反对它。这是任何人对新想法和新体验可能产生的三种反应。在这三种可能的反应中，每一种都有几种不同的表现形式。现在让我们看一看，看看每一种反应意味着什么，以及这些反应来自个人和人类社会本身的何处。</p>
<p>The first response to the Greater Community would be to go away from it. Human beings have a remarkable tendency to engage in denial—denying things that are ever present, denying things that are critical problems in the world, denying things that are chronic difficulties, acting like they are not there or pretending that they are in control of something when actually they are not at all.</p>
<p>对大社区的第一个反应是远离它。人类有一种显著的否认倾向——否认一直存在的事情，否认世界上的关键问题，否认长期存在的困难，假装它们不存在，或者假装他们掌控着某些事物，而实际上它们根本不存在。</p>
<p>Because the Greater Community represents a tremendous change in perception and understanding, because the Greater Community will require such a tremendous change in perception and understanding, there will be a great deal of denial. Many people will simply not want to think of it at all. And though the evidence is growing every day that there is a great deal of visitation going on in the world and that many of these visitors are interfering in human affairs, people act like nothing is happening at all. They will go about their own business, preoccupied with their own personal affairs. They simply will not allow this to come into their consciousness.</p>
<p>因为大社区代表着感知和理解的极大改变，因为大社区将需要一种如此巨大的感知和理解改变，所以将存在大量否认。许多人将根本不想去思考它。尽管每天都有越来越多的证据表明世界上正在发生大量访问，而且其中许多访问者正在干涉人类事务，但人们却表现得好像什么事都没有发生一样。他们将忙于他们自己的事务，专注于他们自己的私事。他们根本不会让这些事情进入他们的意识。</p>
<p>This kind of denial is endemic in the world. People do not want to know. Why is this? Where does this come from? Why does this tendency exist in people to such a great extent?</p>
<p>这种否认在世界上很普遍。人们不想知道。为什么会这样？这从何而来？为什么这种倾向在人们身上如此普遍？</p>
<p>Within the human nature, there are protections against pain, and there is a certain necessity that people be able to gain some kind of sense of control over their affairs. This produces a stability for the individual. This keeps the individual’s motivation to live and to be productive in a functional state. And yet the very mechanism that protects and preserves individuals also works against them, for it can deny the very circumstances and the very events that threaten people’s well-being and that would undermine their real ability to exert control over their lives.</p>
<p>人类天性中存在着对抗痛苦的保护机制，人们也需要获得某种控制他们事务的感觉。这为个人带来了稳定性。这让个人的生活和生产力保持着正常状态。然而，保护和维护个人的机制本身也会对他们不利，因为它可以否认威胁人们福祉并削弱他们真正控制他们生活的能力的情况和事件。</p>
<p>When you read human history, you see the evidence that people were in tremendous denial at times of challenge or change. They acted like nothing was happening, or if they had to admit that something was happening, that they were in fact in charge of it and it would work out fine.</p>
<p>当你阅读人类历史时，你会看到证据表明，当人们面临挑战或变革时，他们极力否认事实。他们表现得好像什么事都没有发生，或者如果他们不得不承认某事正在发生，他们实际上就是掌控者，一切都会顺利。</p>
<p>In some cases, they would appeal to a greater power, saying, “God is in charge of this,” and “God will take care of it,” and “God will produce a happy outcome.” Yet this attempt to preserve their sense of well-being actually put them in jeopardy. It actually made them more vulnerable to harm within the world.</p>
<p>在某些情况下，他们会向更伟大的力量求助，说：“上帝掌管这一切”，“上帝会照顾好这一切”，“上帝会带来一个幸福的结果”。然而，这种试图保持幸福感的做法实际上让他们陷入了危险。这实际上让他们更容易受到世界上的伤害。</p>
<p>Therefore, within each person there is a certain protective mechanism that does not allow them to experience too much pain or too much uncertainty. And yet this is the very mechanism that endangers humanity and prevents it from solving its problems while the problems are small. It is in a sense the very mechanism that makes life more difficult and more hazardous.</p>
<p>因此，每个人内心都有某种保护机制，不允许他们体验太多痛苦或太多不确定性。然而，正是这种机制危及人类，阻止人类在问题还小的时候解决问题。从某种意义上说，正是这种机制让生命变得更加困难和危险。</p>
<p>Yet denial is not simply the result of a built-in survival mechanism. It is also the result of people’s preoccupations. It is also the result of what they have given their allegiance to. Let Us explain this.</p>
<p>然而，否认不仅仅是一种内在生存机制的结果。它也是人们的执念的结果。它也是他们所效忠的事物的结果。让我们来解释一下。</p>
<p>If you give your allegiance to your ideas and to your preferences, then by the very nature of your approach, you are at variance with the realities of life. You are insisting that life give you what you want, and you will either deny or neglect that which proves that your emphasis is incorrect.</p>
<p>如果你忠于你的想法和你的偏好，那么从自然上讲，你的做法与生命的现实背道而驰。你坚持认为生命会给你你想要的事物，而你要么否认，要么忽视，这证明你的重点是错误的。</p>
<p>This preoccupation with happiness, this preoccupation with allegiance to one’s ideas and beliefs, is a very hazardous approach. It sets out only to acknowledge and to identify with certain elements of life, certain aspects of life, and seeks to thwart everything else.</p>
<p>这种对幸福的执着，这种对自己想法和信念的执着，是一种非常危险的做法。它只承认和认同生命的某些元素、生命的某些方面，并试图阻挠其他一切。</p>
<p>For example, [people want] to become wealthy, comfortable and happy, but they do not recognize the course that this is producing for them—the loss of vitality, the loss of relationship, the loss of their inner life. They also do not want to take into consideration that perhaps this is not the best thing for them or for the world. They have set their minds upon one goal, and they will not consider the costs. They will not consider what this really means, and they will pursue their goal relentlessly, not realizing that it is costing them everything and that in fact it may not be meant for them at all.</p>
<p>比如，人们想要变得富有、舒适和快乐，但是他们没有认识到这给他们带来的后果——丧失活力、丧失关系、丧失他们的内在的生命。他们也不想考虑，这或许对他们或对世界来说并不是最好的事情。他们已经将心灵锁定在一个目标上，他们不会考虑代价。他们不会考虑这真正意味着什么，他们将不懈地追求他们的目标，没有意识到这正在让他们付出一切，事实上这可能根本不适合他们。</p>
<p>The idea of Knowledge is fearful to them. The idea that there are grave problems in the world is something they do not want to have to contend with. They are preoccupied with themselves and with their own goals, yet as a result they will not find their true Self, their true purpose and their true meaning in life. And they will not recognize the very circumstances of life that will determine the outcome of their existence and the future of humanity.</p>
<p>内识这个想法令他们感到恐惧。他们不愿面对世界上存在着严重问题的这个想法。他们专注于他们自己和他们自己的目标，然而结果就是在生命中找不到他们的真实自我、他们真实的目的和他们真实的意义。他们无法认识到将决定他们存在的结果和人类未来的生命境遇。</p>
<p>This is fundamentally taking a position without intelligence. In the Greater Community, intelligence is defined as the willingness, the desire and the ability to adapt and to create. That is the definition of intelligence. It is not the size of your brain. It is not how many calculations you can do in a minute. It is the desire, the willingness and the ability to adapt and to create. You cannot create if you cannot adapt though many people attempt to do this every day.</p>
<p>这从根本上来说是一种没有智能的立场。在大社区中，智能被定义为适应和创造的意愿、渴望和能力。这就是智能的定义。它不是你大脑的大小。它不是你在一分钟内能做多少计算。它是适应和创造的渴望、意愿和能力。如果你不能适应，你就无法创造，尽管很多人每天都在尝试这样做。</p>
<p>The real creative impulse comes from a direct engagement with the world, having to create something needed in the world, something that you are endowed to create, something that you have the skills to produce. This is intelligence. Intelligence is the ability to recognize a problem and to immediately address it. There is no other real and meaningful definition of intelligence.</p>
<p>真正的创造冲动来自于与世界的直接接触，需要创造世界上需要的东西，创造你有能力创造的东西，创造你有能力生产的东西。这就是智能。智能是识别问题并立即解决问题的能力。智能没有其他真正有意义的定义。</p>
<p>The demonstration of intelligence is the ability to solve problems in a creative way and to improve the condition of existence both for yourself and for others as a result. And yet denial, in all of its forms and manifestations, demonstrates a profound lack of intelligence. When you avoid or resist what reality is presenting to you, you are not exercising your intelligence. You are forfeiting your intelligence, and with your intelligence you forfeit the ability to adapt and to create.</p>
<p>智能的表现是能够以创造性的方式解决问题，从而改善你自己和他人的生存条件。然而，否认，无论其形式和表现如何，都表明了智能的严重缺乏。当你回避或抵制现实呈现给你的事情时，你就没有锻炼你的智能。你正在丧失你的智能，而随着你智能的丧失，你也丧失了适应和创造的能力。</p>
<p>Here the pursuit of happiness becomes the root of all evil, not because it is inherently bad but because people become obsessed with it to the exclusion of everything else, and what they forfeit for their pursuit is so great and so meaningful and so important for their well-being and their fulfillment.</p>
<p>在这里，追求幸福成为一切罪恶的根源，这并不是因为它本质上是坏的，而是因为人们对它着迷而抛弃了其他一切，而他们为追求幸福而放弃的内识是如此伟大、如此有意义，对他们的幸福和成就感是如此重要。</p>
<p>Many people will go away from the Greater Community. They have their own ideas. They have their own objectives. They do not want life to interfere with their plans. They will simply block this from their awareness, or they will deny that it exists. Or if they cannot deny that it exists, they will turn it into something pleasurable, something good, something that they can identify with, something that supports their personal plans and objectives.</p>
<p>很多人将远离大社区。他们有他们自己的想法。他们有他们自己的目标。他们不想让生命干扰他们的计划。他们将简单地从他们的觉知中阻止它，或者他们将否认它的存在。或者如果他们无法否认它的存在，他们将把它变成某种令人愉悦的事情、某种美好的事情、某种他们能够认同的事情、某种支持他们个人计划和目标的事情。</p>
<p>This is happening in the world today. Many people think, “Oh, the visitation from other forms of intelligent life is a great spiritual event”—something that will fulfill their ideals, something that will give them the sense of enlightenment, hope and peace that they are seeking in their own lives. Yet even these goals, which in a sense represent the true purpose of life, are miscalculated and misinterpreted here.</p>
<p>当今世界正在发生这样的事情。许多人认为，“好吧，其他智能生命的造访是一次伟大的精神事件”——这将实现他们的理想，给他们带来他们在他们自己的生活中寻求的启蒙、希望与和平。然而，即使是这些目标，在某种意义上代表了生命的真实目的，在这里也被误算和曲解了。</p>
<p>To see the real possibility for peace—developing equanimity, bringing greater harmony into the human family—you must work with reality as it really is. You cannot superimpose your ideals or your values, for life will not respond to this and you will lose touch with both your real nature within yourself and the reality of life around you. You will become estranged from life and from yourself, and the very ideals that you thought would give you the greater rewards of life will actually rob you of them.</p>
<p>要看到和平的真正可能性——发展平静，为人类大家庭带来更伟大的和谐——你必须面对现实。你不能强加你的理想或价值观，因为生命不会对此作出回应，你将失去与你内在的真正自然以及你周围生命现实的联系。你将疏远生命和你自己，你认为会给你带来更大回报的理想实际上会夺走它们。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who hope and believe that the presence of the Greater Community here will bring peace and equanimity and true resolution to human life. They do not want to see the real situation. They only want to see what they want to see, and this is not seeing. They only want to think what they want to think, but this is not thinking.</p>
<p>当今世界上有许多人希望并相信大社区的存在将为人类生命带来和平、平静和真实的解决。他们不想看到实际的情况。他们只想看到他们想看到的，而这不是看见。他们只想思考他们想思考的，而这不是思考。</p>
<p>They are not exercising their intelligence here. They are not calling upon Knowledge within them to reveal the real truth. They are not opening their eyes to see things as they really are. This is a form of denial. This is going away from reality. This is avoiding the meaning, purpose and nature of life.</p>
<p>他们没有在这里运用他们的智能。他们没有召唤他们内在的内识来揭示真正的真理。他们没有睁开眼睛看清事物的本来面目。这是一种否认。这是远离现实。这是回避生命的意义、目的和自然。</p>
<p>Therefore, when We say that people will go away from the Greater Community, this can manifest itself in many different ways. Many will simply turn away, believing that this does not exist, and for them there will not be enough evidence in the world to convince them. Unless their lives are overtaken, they will deny and avoid the reality that the Greater Community is in the world and is casting a great influence there.</p>
<p>因此，当我们说人们将远离大社区时，这可以以许多不同的方式体现出来。很多人将只是转身离开，相信大社区并不存在，对他们来说，世界上没有足够的证据来说服他们。除非他们的生命被超越，否则他们将否认和回避大社区在世界上并在那里施加巨大影响的现实。</p>
<p>Others will consider that it is a possibility, but their conclusions will only be made to reinforce their ideas and their beliefs. They do not want their world view to be threatened or challenged. They only want life to confirm it, and so they will use the evidence that the Greater Community is in the world to confirm their world view, whatever it may be. They will acknowledge that it is a reality, but they will construe it to serve their personal interests and aims.</p>
<p>其他人会认为这是一种可能性，但他们的结论只是为了强化他们的想法和信仰。他们不希望他们的世界观受到威胁或挑战。他们只希望生命来证实它，因此他们将利用大社区存在于世界上的证据来证实他们的世界观，无论它是什么。他们将承认这是一个现实，但他们将对其进行解读以服务于他们的个人利益和目标。</p>
<p>They will turn and look, but they will not see, for they will only see their thoughts and their beliefs, unable to see beyond them. This represents denial and avoidance—an inability to engage with life as it really is, an inability to open the mind and to consider something new, an inability to be vulnerable to life, an inability to begin anew in developing a new set of strengths and abilities.</p>
<p>他们会转过身去看，但他们将看不见，因为他们只会看到他们的想法和他们的信仰，无法超越它们。这代表着否认和逃避——无法参与生命的本来面目，无法打开心灵去思考新的事物，无法面对生命，无法重新开始发展一套新的力量和能力。</p>
<p>Many people will go away. Other people will go against the Greater Community. Unable to go away or to deny its existence, they will struggle against it. They will believe that the visitors are here to destroy them. They will believe perhaps that the visitors represent demonic forces and will attempt to interpret their presence here based upon old religious teachings in the world.</p>
<p>许多人会离开。其他人会反对大社区。他们无法离开或否认它的存在，因此会与之抗争。他们会相信来访者来此是为了毁灭他们。他们或许会相信来访者代表着恶魔般的力量，并试图根据世界上古老的宗教教导来解释他们在此的存在。</p>
<p>In a sense, they are exercising avoidance as well because they cannot recognize that the visitors are sentient beings like themselves, driven by their own needs and preoccupations, like themselves. They will turn them into demons, into the agents of Satan.</p>
<p>从某种意义上说，他们也在回避，因为他们无法认识到来访者和他们一样都是有情的存在，被他们自己的需求和心事所驱使，就像他们自己一样。他们会把来访者变成恶魔，变成撒旦的代理人。</p>
<p>They will interpret the reality of the Greater Community from their own religious perspective, but they will not see. They will fight against the Greater Community, insisting that humanity be left alone to its own devices, but they will not understand that humanity is at a new threshold and that the presence of the Greater Community represents the evolution of life within this world. They will fight to maintain their religious ideas. They will fight to maintain their own self-identity as they know it without accepting the possibility that there is a new panorama for growth and development.</p>
<p>他们将从他们自己的宗教视角解读大社区的现实，但他们看不见。他们将与大社区作斗争，坚持让人类自行其是，但他们不会理解人类正处在一个新的门槛，大社区的存在代表着这个世界生命的进化。他们将为维护他们的宗教想法而斗争。他们将为维护他们自己所知道的自我身份而斗争，而不接受存在着一种新的成长和发展全景的可能性。</p>
<p>They will struggle against this reality. They will see it from their own retreated position. Yet they will not understand what they are dealing with. They too will not be able to see even though they are looking. They will be governed by fear and by anxiety.</p>
<p>他们将与这个现实作斗争。他们将从他们自己退缩的立场看待这个现实。然而，他们不会理解他们在面对什么。他们虽然在看，但也无法看清。他们将被恐惧和焦虑所支配。</p>
<p>The third possible response is to go towards the Greater Community, to recognize that it is a reality, to recognize that it is new, to recognize that it needs and requires a new approach and a new understanding. There will be a few people in the world who will recognize it and who will make a sincere attempt to comprehend its meaning. If they can be successful, if they can learn a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, they will be in a position to educate and to guide others and will themselves be a positive force for advancement within the world.</p>
<p>第三个可能的回应是走向大社区，认识到它是一个现实，认识到它是新的，认识到它需要并要求一种新的办法和一种新的理解。世界上会有少数人会认识到它，并真诚地尝试去理解它的含义。如果他们能够成功，如果他们能够学习一种大社区内识之路，他们将能够教育和指导他人，他们自己也将成为世界进步的一股积极力量。</p>
<p>Yet they too face great difficulties, but they must learn to see the situation with new eyes and with a new understanding. They must develop their perception and discernment. They must be able to learn about life in the Greater Community, to comprehend the meaning and the intent of the visitors. They must have the ability to see that the visitors are not angels and are not demons but are real sentient beings like themselves. They must move beyond the dichotomy of good and evil in order to see clearly and objectively.</p>
<p>然而他们也面临伟大的困难，但他们必须学会用新的眼光和新的理解来看待形势。他们必须发展他们的感知力和辨别力。他们必须能够学习大社区的生命，理解来访者的意义和意图。他们必须有能力看到，来访者不是天使，也不是恶魔，而是像他们一样真实的众生。他们必须超越善恶的二分法，才能清晰而客观地看待事情。</p>
<p>They will also have to contend with the tremendous denial that will exist and the fear and hostility that will exist all around them. Either people will not want to know or they will only see things fearfully and defensively. They will have to contend with these prevailing attitudes and beliefs, which in some ways will present even a greater obstacle than the presence of the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>他们还必须应对将存在的巨大否认以及将存在于他们周围的恐惧和敌意。要么人们不想知道，要么他们只会恐惧和防御地看待事情。他们将必须应对这些盛行的态度和信念，从某种程度上来说，它们甚至会比大社区本身的存在带来更大的障碍。</p>
<p>They will have to learn to distinguish between what they believe and what they know. They will have to recognize the superstitions that exist even in their own thinking and evaluations. Their learning requirements will be enormous, yet they will have an opportunity for discovery, for creation, for adaptation, that no one else around them will have.</p>
<p>他们将必须学会区分他们所相信的和他们所知道的。他们必须认识到甚至存在于他们自己的思维和评价中的迷信。他们的学习需求将是巨大的，但他们将有一个机会去发现、去创造、去适应，这是他们周围的其他人所没有的。</p>
<p>Therefore, there are three possible responses to the Greater Community. These are the same three possible responses that one can have to any new experience in life. These are the three possibilities that anyone can have to confronting difficulty or adversity in life.</p>
<p>因此，对大社区有三种可能的反应。这三种反应与一个人对任何新的生命体验的反应相同。这三种反应与任何人面对生命中的困难或逆境时都可能拥有的反应相同。</p>
<p>The presence of the Greater Community represents difficulty, adversity and opportunity. Yet who is in a position to recognize this? Who can see this? Who can see things as they really are? Who has the courage to look? Who has the ability to discern the difference between reality and their own perception? Who has the patience and perseverance to learn a Greater Community Way of Knowledge?</p>
<p>大社区的存在代表着困难、逆境和机会。然而谁有能力认出这一点？谁能看到这一点？谁能看到事情的本来面目？谁有勇气去看？谁有能力辨别现实和他们自己感知之间的差异？谁有耐心和毅力去学习一条大社区的内识之路？</p>
<p>There are very powerful forces in the world that keep humanity in a state of ignorance. In some cases, they attempt to do this as their intention. In other cases, they do this inadvertently because they are ignorant.</p>
<p>世界上存在着非常强大的势力，使人类处于无知状态。在某些情况下，他们试图这样做是出于他们的意图。在其他情况下，他们因为无知而无意中这样做。</p>
<p>Governments within the world attempt to keep their populations obedient and compliant. This is done intentionally. They believe it is up to them to solve the great threshold problems and that the average person is not equipped or able to do this. They give themselves the sole authority and responsibility to solve the great problems of humanity. But without the will of the population, how can they do this? They do not believe in Knowledge. They only believe in persuasion and manipulation.</p>
<p>世界上的政府都试图让民众保持服从和顺从。这是有意为之的。他们相信，解决伟大门槛问题的责任在他们身上，而普通人并不具备这样的条件或能力。他们赋予他们自己解决人类伟大问题的唯一权威和责任。但如果没有民众的意志，他们怎么能做到这一点呢？他们不相信内识。他们只相信说服和操纵。</p>
<p>The religious institutions in the world today want to preserve their ancient beliefs. They want to preserve their authority. They want to preserve a traditional interpretation of divinity and human purpose and destiny.</p>
<p>当今世界的宗教机构想要保留他们古老的信仰。他们想要保留他们的权威。他们想要保留对神性和人类目的与天命的传统解读。</p>
<p>For them, the Greater Community represents such a challenge and such a threat that they are more prone to be in denial of it completely. And if they do become aware of it and are able to interpret it wisely, will they have the courage and integrity to educate people, to educate their followers and their congregations?</p>
<p>对他们来说，大社区代表着如此巨大的挑战和威胁，以致于他们更倾向于完全否认它。如果他们确实察觉到了它，并能够明智地解读它，他们是否有勇气和完整性去教育人们，教育他们的追随者和他们的会众？</p>
<p>These are very serious questions. The answer to them can be found by looking inside yourself, at your own tendencies, at your own beliefs. All of the tendencies that I have spoken of so far exist within you because you have been in denial about things in your life in the past. You have struggled against change and adversity. And, at times, you have gone towards something that was new and that required a new approach.</p>
<p>这些都是非常严肃的问题。答案可以通过审视你自己的内心、你自己的倾向和你自己的信念来找到。我到目前为止所说的所有倾向都存在于你的内心，因为你过去一直否认生命中的事情。你一直在与变化和逆境作斗争。有时，你会走向新的事物，而这需要一种新的方法。</p>
<p>You who are reading this book have demonstrated all three of these possible responses. Even as you read this book, even as you face the challenge and the opportunity that We are presenting here, you can feel these tendencies within yourself. It is all there. And you most certainly will see them all around you in the people that you know and in the tenor, and emphasis and priorities of the public.</p>
<p>正在阅读本书的你已经展现了这三种可能的反应。即使当你阅读本书时，即使当你面对我们在此提出的挑战和机会时，你也能在你自己内心深处感受到这些倾向。它们就在那里。你肯定会在你周围你所认识的人中、在公众的语气、重点和优先事项中看到它们。</p>
<p>Read your newspapers. You will see where human priorities exist. People are fascinated by murder and mayhem but do not want to contend with the greater events that are happening in life. They do not want to face the fact that the food supply in the world is diminishing, that topsoil is diminishing, that environmental systems are breaking down, that increasingly there is less opportunity in life and greater adversity.</p>
<p>阅读报纸。你会看到人类的优先事项在哪里。人们对谋杀和混乱着迷，但不想与生命中发生的更大事件抗争。他们不想面对这样的事实：世界上的粮食供应正在减少，表面的土壤正在减少，环境系统正在崩溃，生命中的正在机会越来越少，逆境却越来越大。</p>
<p>They do not even want to recognize the possibility that the Greater Community is in the world. Perhaps they will think, “Well, we don’t need one more problem like this!” There is a fundamental inability here to see life as it really is and to differentiate between what is a small problem and what is a great problem. This inability is supported by the powerful institutions in the world today.</p>
<p>他们甚至不想承认大社区存在于这个世界的可能性。也许他们会想：“好吧，我们不需要再遇到这样的问题了！”他们根本就无法看清生命的本来面目，无法区分什么是小问题，什么是大问题。这种无能得到了当今世界强大机构的支持。</p>
<p>It is only because of the courageous acts of individuals and small groups that humanity has any hope of keeping pace with its changing circumstances. There needs to be more of these individuals. It cannot simply be the responsibility of one or two gifted people here and there. The need for education must be felt within each person. You cannot rely upon your institutions alone, for they may be unwilling or unable to provide the greater education that you need. It is your responsibility. It is your response.</p>
<p>正是因为个人和小型团体的勇敢行动，人类才有希望跟上不断变化的环境。需要有更多这样的人。这不能仅仅依赖某些天赋异禀的人。对教育的需求必须在每个人内心产生共鸣。你不能仅仅依赖于现有的制度，因为它们可能不愿意或无法提供你所需要的更伟大的教育。它是你的责任，它是你的回应。</p>
<p>If you turn away from the future, it will overtake you. If you fight the future, it will defeat you. Yet if you can move towards the future and prepare yourself for the future, then you will be equipped not only to deal with it directly, but to use it to produce beneficial results for yourself and for others. This is what is necessary now.</p>
<p>如果你逃避未来，未来就会战胜你。如果你与未来抗争，未来就会打败你。然而，如果你能走向未来，为未来做好准备，那么你不仅有能力直接应对未来，还能使用未来为你自己和他人创造有益的结果。这正是现在所需要的。</p>
<p>Within you, you have a great nature and you have a weak nature. Your great nature is represented by the reality of Knowledge within you. Your weak nature is your tendency to attempt to live without Knowledge and to rely upon your own ideas and preferences to guide you. Here you must choose, not only once but again and again, to find and to claim your greater nature and to receive the greater power and responsibility that this gives to you.</p>
<p>在你的内在，你有一个伟大的自然，也有一个软弱的自然。你的伟大自然由你内在内识的现实所代表。你的软弱自然是你倾向于试图在没有内识的情况下生活，并依靠你自己的想法和偏好来指导你。在这里，你必须做出选择，不只一次，而是一次又一次，去发现和宣称你的更伟大自然，并接受这赋予你的更伟大力量和责任。</p>
<p>If you seek to escape and go live in a world of fantasy, giving all of your attention to your relationships, to your hobbies or to your personal goals, you will not be in a position to contribute to life, and life will seem to be a great adversity to you.</p>
<p>如果你试图逃避现实，生活在一个幻想的世界里，把所有的注意力都放在你的人际关系、爱好或个人目标上，那么你就无法为生命做出贡献，生命对你来说似乎会是一个巨大的逆境。</p>
<p>If you struggle against change and new revelations, you will be struggling against yourself, for Knowledge within you seeks to move you forward into the future by enabling you to engage with the present in a real and productive way. Yet if you hold to your ideas, if you cling to your beliefs and associations, you will not be able to respond to Knowledge. Life to you will become like a battleground, and happiness, peace and equanimity will be unknown to you.</p>
<p>如果你抗拒改变和新的启示，那么你就是在抗拒你自己，因为你内在的内识寻求通过让你以一种真实而富有成效的方式参与当下，来推动你走向未来。然而，如果你坚持你的想法，如果你坚持你的信仰和联想，那么你将无法回应内识。生命对你来说将变成一个战场，幸福、和平与平静对你来说将一无所知。</p>
<p>There is another problem. That is the problem of influence. This is the problem of humanity’s lack of skill and awareness of the mental environment. Today the Greater Community presences are attempting to establish themselves in the world. They are here to gain resources from the world. They are attempting to cast influence over human thinking.</p>
<p>还有另一个问题。它是影响力的问题。这是人类缺乏技能和对心理环境的觉知的问题。今天，大社区的存在正试图在世界上建立他们自己的地位。他们来这里是为了从世界获取资源。他们试图对人类思维施加影响。</p>
<p>Part of their agenda is to take the brightest and most freethinking individuals, those who are perhaps the least traditional or conventional in their approach, and to pacify them. Here We see, for instance, a spiritual emphasis on peace and harmony and retreat from life. And yet this is not a retreat to the monastery or the convent where real spiritual focus and activity are carried out. Rather, it is more like a retreat from life itself.</p>
<p>他们的部分议程是安抚那些最聪明、最自由思想的人，这些人也许是他们行事方式最不传统或最不循规蹈矩的人。例如，在这里，我们看到一种对和平与和谐以及逃避生命的精神强调。然而，这并不是在修道院或女修道院进行真正的精神关注和活动。相反，它更像是对生命本身的逃避。</p>
<p>There is some spiritual teaching in the world today [that] does not have a Divine source. It is the product of Greater Community intervention. It motivates people to seek happiness and comfort beyond all things, setting them into a process of retreat from life and retreat from themselves.</p>
<p>当今世界存在一些没有神圣来源的精神教导。它是大社区干预的产物。它激励人们寻求超越一切的幸福和舒适，让他们陷入逃避生命、逃避他们自己的过程。</p>
<p>While these teachings promise enlightenment, unbounded happiness, equanimity and uninterrupted joyfulness, they in fact neutralize the deeper inclinations of the people who are affected and put them into a position where they cannot see, they cannot know and they cannot act according to Knowledge. Their desires, their preferences, their hopes are so indulged that they cannot see or know anything else.</p>
<p>虽然这些教导承诺带来启蒙、无限的幸福、平静和不间断的快乐，但它们实际上抵消了受影响的人的更深层次的倾向，使他们处于无法看见、无法知道、无法根据内识行事的境地。他们的欲望、偏好和希望被如此放纵，以至于他们看不到或不知道任何其他事情。</p>
<p>It is a remarkable thing that with the world becoming ever more demanding, calling for resolution, calling for positive engagement, calling for contribution, that so many people who are in a position to provide these things are becoming pacified and disabled. They retreat to their little hamlets in the mountains or on the beach. They go away from everyone and everything that they find to be distasteful. They seek to isolate themselves and insulate themselves in a world without tribulation, in a world without difficulty.</p>
<p>令人惊奇的是，随着世界变得越来越苛刻，要求解决、要求积极参与、要求贡献，许多有能力提供这些事物的人却变得沉默寡言、无能为力。他们躲进山里或海边的小村庄。他们远离他们认为令人厌恶的每个人和每件事。他们试图孤立他们自己，让他们自己生活在一个没有苦难、没有困难的世界里。</p>
<p>And yet they wonder why there is such tribulation within themselves. Perhaps they are taught that it is part of their spiritual unfolding when in reality it is the conflict that they are experiencing that is the result of the inability to engage with life within themselves or life within the world. They suffer, but their suffering is justified. They want to surrender their power to a greater power, but they do not have the wisdom or discernment to know who to surrender themselves to or what this really means.</p>
<p>然而他们却疑惑，为什么他们内心会有如此的苦难。也许他们被教导说，这是他们精神发展的一部分，而事实上，他们所经历的冲突是他们无法融入他们内心的生命或世界的生命的结果。他们遭受痛苦，但他们的痛苦是合理的。他们想把他们的力量交给一个更伟大的力量，但他们没有智慧或辨别力去知道该向谁臣服，或者这到底意味着什么。</p>
<p>So they give it all away to be guided, but they do not know who is guiding them. They want to be free of responsibilities of life. They want someone else to make the decisions for them. They think that being like little children, carried along, led along by the hand, is the way to live life and to be genuine within life. They forfeit their authority. They lose connection with their soul, all the while believing that they are living a truly spiritual life.</p>
<p>所以他们把一切都交给其他人去引导，但他们不知道是谁在引导他们。他们想摆脱生命中的责任。他们想让其他人为他们做决定。他们认为，像小孩子一样，被人牵着手走、被人带着走，才是生活的方式，才是真正的生命。他们放弃了他们的权威。他们失去了他们与灵魂的连接，却一直相信他们过着真正精神的生命。</p>
<p>They are not in a position to face the Greater Community. They are not in a position to understand the Greater Community. They are not in a position to use their own authority to call upon their own strength, to set aside their preferences, to risk their happiness, to do something vital and necessary in life. They have lost the will to engage with life. They have given over their authority.</p>
<p>他们没有一个位置去面对大社区。他们没有一个位置去理解大社区。他们没有一个位置使用他们自己的权威来运用他们自己的力量，放下他们的偏好，冒着他们失去幸福的风险，去做生命中重要而必要的事情。他们失去了参与生命的意志。他们放弃了他们的权威。</p>
<p>I can assure you that the Creator does not will this. This is not the way. The focus of the Creator and the Unseen Ones is to make people strong, responsible and capable. It is not to generate some kind of spiritual welfare where people hope and expect that everything will be provided for them.</p>
<p>我可以向你保证，造物主并不想这样。这不是出路。造物主和不可见者的重点是让人们变得强大、负责和有能力。而不是创造某种精神福利，让人们希望和期待一切都会得到满足。</p>
<p>I can assure you that the Greater Community forces who are interacting with humanity will take full advantage of these tendencies and will use them for their own benefit. They will study these individuals. They will neutralize their deeper tendencies. They will take advantage of their naiveté. And they will direct their good intentions.</p>
<p>我可以向你保证，与人类互动的大社区势力将充分利用这些倾向，并将其用于他们自己的利益。他们将研究这些人。他们将消除他们更深层次的倾向。他们将利用他们的天真。他们将引导他们的良好意图。</p>
<p>Perhaps at this point you are thinking, “My God! Is this possible? How can this be?” But when you gain skill and understanding of the mental environment, you will see what an opportunity this creates for the visitors and how relatively easy it is for them to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>或许此刻你在想：“天哪！这可能吗？这怎么可能？”但是当你获得技能并理解心理环境时，你将看到这为来访者创造了多大的机会，以及他们多么容易利用它。</p>
<p>Do not trust any spiritual teaching that does not emphasize your authority, that does not emphasize the reclamation of Knowledge within you, that does not call you into the world to respond and to act, to contribute, to learn and to give. Do not respond to any spiritual teaching that robs you of your responsibility to do this and that does not cultivate genuine and practical wisdom within you.</p>
<p>不要去信任任何不强调你的权威、不强调唤起你内在内识、不召唤你来到世界去回应和行动、去贡献、去学习和去给予的精神教导。不要回应任何剥夺你这样做的责任、不培养你内在真正和实用智慧的精神教导。</p>
<p>This you must discern for yourself if you are going to be amongst those courageous individuals who will choose to face life and to engage with life, who will choose to become strong in The Way of Knowledge and who will choose to develop wisdom.</p>
<p>如果你想成为那些勇敢的人之一，选择面对生命、参与生命，选择在内识之路上变得强大，选择发展智慧，那么你必须自己辨别这一点。</p>
<p>As We have said, it is the tendencies of humanity rather than the intentions of the visitors that will be the most difficult and discouraging things to deal with. For there is a preparation to learn how to interpret, contend with and relate to the Greater Community presences in the world. They are not all powerful. They are not omnipotent. They are relying upon human weakness to establish themselves.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，最难处理和最令人沮丧的是人类的倾向，而不是来访者的意图。因为需要做好准备，学习如何解释、应对和处理大社区在这个世界上的存在。他们并非无所不能。它们并非无所不能。它们依靠人类的弱点来建立他们自己。</p>
<p>But where human strength can emerge, they will find that humanity will be more than a match, and they will have to adjust their agenda, and they will have to change their approach, and they will have to learn to respect the rights, privileges and dominion of human existence.</p>
<p>但在人类力量能够显现的地方，他们会发现人类是无法匹敌的，他们将必须调整他们的议程，他们将必须改变他们的方法，他们将必须学会尊重人类生存的权利、特权和统治。</p>
<p>Yet you must earn their respect. You must demonstrate your abilities. You must establish your boundaries. You must gain your discernment. You must exercise your authority. Even if you are the only person you know who is doing this, you must do this.</p>
<p>但你必须赢得他们的尊重。你必须展示你的能力。你必须确立你的界限。你必须获得你的辨别力。你必须行使你的权威。即使你是你知道的唯一一个这样做的人，你也必须这样做。</p>
<p>Look to life. Become a student of Knowledge. Let the greater power emerge within you. It will revitalize you. It will give you courage and strength and perseverance. It will lift you above demoralization and discouragement. It will give you the Light of life. It will give you what the Creator wants you to have, and it will enable you to do what the Creator wants you to do. It will enable you to rise above the fog of human denial, human ambivalence and human hostility. It will take you out of the realm of belief into the realm of certainty, wisdom and strength.</p>
<p>放眼生命。成为内识的学生。让更伟大的力量在你内在显现。它将使你焕发活力。它将赋予你勇气、力量和毅力。它将使你摆脱士气低落和气馁。它将赋予你生命之光。它将赋予你造物主希望你拥有的内识，它将使你能够做造物主希望你做的事情。它将使你能够超越人类否认、人类矛盾和人类敌意的迷雾。它将带你走出信仰的领域，进入确定性、智慧和力量的领域。</p>
