<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 5, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月5日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you have a physical proximity in which you live and function, you also have a mental environment in which you learn to think. Yet it takes a long time to learn how to develop discernment and ability within this mental environment. In fact, for humanity at this point, the mental environment represents a great frontier, a whole new area to explore and within which to gain strength and ability.</p>
<p>你们拥有一个可以生活和活动的物理环境，你们也拥有一个可以学习思考的心理环境。然而，要学会如何在这个心理环境中发展辨别力和能力需要很长时间。事实上，对于目前的人类来说，心理环境代表着一个伟大的前沿，一个可以探索的全新领域，一个可以获得力量和能力的领域。</p>
<p>It is important for you to know, however, that there is an environment in which you think. This environment is filled with many forces, very few of which have anything to do with you personally. You could go into any home on any avenue, on any street, in any city, and each home would have its own mental environment. And the individuals living in those environments represent the chief forces within those mental environments.</p>
<p>然而，重要的是，你要知道，你思考的环境是存在的。这个环境充满了许多力量，其中只有极少数与你个人有关。你可以走进任何大街、任何街道、任何城市的任何一户人家，每户人家都有它自己的心理环境。生活在这些环境中的个人代表了这些心理环境中的主要力量。</p>
<p>Your experience of the mental environment has been part of your life since you were born. There are so many examples if you begin to think about it. Every place you go has its own mental environment. Every home you enter has its unique mental environment. Every person around whom you spend any amount of time, you create a mental environment together.</p>
<p>你的心理环境体验从你出生以来就一直是你生命的一部分。如果你开始思考，就会发现有很多例子。你去的每一个地方都有它自己的心理环境。你进入的每一个家庭都有它独特的心理环境。你身边的每一个人，无论你花了多少时间，都会共同创造一个心理环境。</p>
<p>Within your own mental environment, you have the possibility or the potential to be the greatest influence, and this is encouraged here. But as We have said, your mental environment is filled with other forces and influences as well, most of which have very little to do with you. That is because you cannot isolate yourself in the world. And within the mental environment, there are no borders or boundaries unless you learn to establish them yourself.</p>
<p>在你自己的心理环境中，你有可能或有潜力成为最伟大的影响力，而这一点在这里受到鼓励。但正如我们所说，你的心理环境也充满了其他力量和影响力，其中大多数与你关系不大。那是因为你无法把你自己孤立在世界上。在心理环境中，没有边界或界限，除非你学会建立你自己的边界。</p>
<p>Into even the sanctity of your own home, the influences of the world find expression through the media, through the written word and through your interactions with people. It is necessary in becoming a student of Knowledge to learn to become responsible and effective in your own mental environment, for you cannot hope to advance in The Way of Knowledge, you cannot hope to gain greater clarity or ability if the things that are influencing your life are not addressed and recognized. Here you must learn what is affecting you, and then you must select who and what are beneficial and who and what are not beneficial.</p>
<p>甚至在你自己神圣的家中，世界的影响也会通过媒体、通过文字、通过你与人的互动得到表达。成为内识的学生，有必要学会在你自己的心理环境中变得负责和有效，因为如果你不处理和认出影响你生命的事物，你就无法希望在内识之路上前进，你也无法希望获得更伟大的清晰度或能力。在这里，你必须了解什么正在影响你，然后选择对你有益的人和事，以及对你无益的人和事。</p>
<p>Within this process, you come to realize that there are no neutral influences in the mental environment. Everything and everyone with whom you come into contact in any kind of meaningful way is either helping or hindering you in your advancement. However, as a student of Knowledge, you learn to utilize all influences that you encounter for your own benefit and for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>在这个过程中，你会意识到，在心理环境中不存在中性影响。你以任何有意义的方式接触到的每件事、每个人要么在帮助你进步，要么在阻碍你进步。然而，作为一名内识的学生，你会学会善用你遇到的所有影响，为你自己谋取益处，也为他人谋取益处。</p>
<p>Yet this represents a more advanced skill. And in the interim, for your own well-being and to enable you to proceed, you must learn to limit or offset those influences that hinder you and emphasize and encourage those influences that actually help you along the way. If this is not done, your progress will be thwarted and will be very slow and difficult.</p>
<p>然而这代表着一种更先进的技能。在此期间，为了你自己的福祉，为了使你能够继续前进，你必须学会​​限制或抵消那些阻碍你的影响，并强调和鼓励那些实际上一路帮助你的影响。如果不这样做，你的进步将受到阻碍，将非常缓慢和困难。</p>
<p>This is a natural part of gaining inner authority. This is a natural part of claiming responsibility for your life and learning how to direct it according to the wisdom and the grace of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>这是获得内在权威的自然部分。这是承担起你生命的责任并学习如何根据你内在的智慧和内识的恩典来指引你的生命的自然部分。</p>
<p>Surely, you must encounter those influences and those relationships that stand in the way of this. And you will encounter them even at the outset, for as your studenthood in The Way of Knowledge becomes stronger, you will come to realize, for example, who in your life really supports this within you and who does not, who can really encourage it and who is afraid of it, who really trusts it and who does not.</p>
<p>当然，你一定会遭遇阻碍这一切的那些影响和那些关系。你甚至会在一开始就遭遇它们，因为随着你在内识之路上的学生身份变得更加强大，你将开始意识到，例如，你生命中谁真正支持你内在的内识，谁不支持内识，谁能真正鼓励你的内心，谁害怕你的内心，谁真正信任你的内心，谁不信任你的内心。</p>
<p>Many people when they begin their true spiritual journey discover with great shock that many of their longstanding relationships stand in contrast to their primary aim and purpose now. And they are surprised, for even long-term friendships can be seen to be counterproductive.</p>
<p>许多人在开始真实的精神之旅时，会震惊地发现，他们许多长期的关系与他们现在的主要目标和目的背道而驰。他们很惊讶，因为即使是长期的友谊也会被视为适得其反。</p>
<p>Often this is very difficult for the person starting out because they have a natural allegiance to their friends and to their loved ones. But gaining a greater allegiance to Knowledge sometimes brings conflict. For those relationships to which they hold allegiance often thwart or interfere with their ability to gain trust and integrity within themselves.</p>
<p>这对于刚开始的人来说往往非常困难，因为他们对朋友和所爱之人有着天然的忠诚。但获得对内识的更大忠诚有时也会带来冲突。因为他们所忠诚的那些关系常常会阻碍或干扰他们自己获得内心信任和完整性的能力。</p>
<p>For many people, this is the first great hurdle to overcome. They must overcome their allegiances to others to emphasize a greater allegiance to Knowledge. In other words, instead of doing what other people want them to do, they must gain the inner authority to do what they know they must do. This can be quite challenging.</p>
<p>对于很多人来说，这是第一个需要克服的巨大障碍。他们必须克服对他人的忠诚，以强调对内识的更大忠诚。换句话说，他们必须获得内在权威，去做他们知道他们必须做的事，而不是去做他人希望他们做的事。这可能相当具有挑战性。</p>
<p>It is remarkable when you realize how great an influence your relationships have upon you and how much you adapt yourself to them. Accommodating yourself to other people may be a social necessity under certain circumstances, but within the foundation of your life, it will often impose very damaging effects.</p>
<p>当你意识到人际关系对你有多大的影响，以及你如何适应人际关系时，你会感到非常惊讶。在某些情况下，迁就他人可能是一种社交需要，但在你生命的基础中，它往往会带来非常有害的影响。</p>
<p>The man and woman of Knowledge, if they have progressed far enough, will be able to make natural and strong commitments in their relationships, but they must have the inner authority to do this and to know how it can be done responsibly and effectively. Someone who does not have this authority cannot make real commitments to others. They are not in a position to direct or to determine their lives, and so they cannot give of themselves freely.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人和女人，如果他们已经进步得足够远，将能够在他们的关系中做出自然而坚定的承诺，但他们必须拥有内在的权威来做到这一点，并知道如何负责任和有效地做到这一点。没有这种权威的人无法对他人做出真正的承诺。他们没有能力指导或决定他们的生活，因此他们无法自由地给予他们自己。</p>
<p>You must have yourself to give yourself. You must know yourself to direct your life. Otherwise, you will have other people and other forces direct your life. In fact, this is happening all around you.</p>
<p>你必须拥有你自己才能给予你自己。你必须知道你自己才能指导你的生命。否则，你的生命将由其他人和其他力量来掌控。事实上，这种情况正在你身边发生。</p>
<p>Look about and you will see that people have given over the authority of their lives to their relationships with work, with people, with their habits, with their addictions, with their fears, with their interests, with their preoccupations and so forth. And the world encourages this because, in a sense, societies around the world want their populations to be compliant and to be uniform and to be obedient.</p>
<p>环顾四周，你会看到人们已经把他们生活的主导权交给了他们与工作、与他人、与习惯、与瘾癖、与恐惧、与兴趣、与关注点等的关系。世界鼓励这种做法，因为从某种意义上说，世界各地的社会都希望其人民顺从、统一和服从。</p>
<p>So people are weakened, and their delights and their phobias are emphasized. And they are encouraged to consume. And they are encouraged to believe certain things and to avoid thinking about other things. This greatly affects the physical environment in which you live, but it is predominantly felt at the level of thought and belief.</p>
<p>因此，人们变得软弱，而他们的快乐和恐惧被强调。他们被鼓励消费。他们被鼓励相信某些事情，避免思考其他事情。这极大地影响了你生活的物理环境，但主要体现在思想和信仰层面。</p>
<p>Now We enter into a new environment, an environment into which people have rarely ventured in a conscious way. Very few people in the world realize the effect of their thoughts upon others or the effect of others’ thoughts upon them in any kind of objective way.</p>
<p>现在我们进入了一个新的环境，一个人们很少有意识地进入的环境。世界上很少有人能以任何客观的方式意识到他们的思想对他人的影响，或他人的思想对他们的影响。</p>
<p>Yes, they feel good around certain people and not as good around others, but they do not understand the dynamics of why this is the case and how they can learn to deal with it effectively. Giving yourself to those whom you like and avoiding those whom you do not like does not constitute any degree of ability or effectiveness in the mental environment.</p>
<p>是的，他们在某些人身边感觉良好，而在其他人身边感觉不好，但他们不理解为什么会出现这种情况，也不知道如何有效地处理这种情况。把你自己奉献给那些你喜欢的人，避开那些你不喜欢的人，这在心理环境中并不构成任何程度的能力或效力。</p>
<p>Here there are two great stages in learning. The first is to understand what your mental environment is at the moment and to learn how to redirect it, or to reconstitute it to become a supportive environment, an environment that supports the reclamation of Knowledge, that supports your quest for real integrity and ability. This first stage requires a tremendous amount of re-evaluation and the exertion of your own Knowledge as opposed to your will alone. For will is exerted to support ideas and beliefs, but Knowledge is exerted to support reality and relationship.</p>
<p>这里有两个伟大的学习阶段。第一阶段是理解你此刻的心理环境是什么，并学习如何重新引导它，或重建它，使之成为一个支持性的环境，一个支持恢复内识的环境，一个支持你寻求真正的完整性和能力的环境。这第一阶段需要大量的重新评估和运用你自己的内识，而不是仅仅运用你的意志。因为运用意志是为了支持想法和信仰，而运用内识是为了支持现实和关系。</p>
<p>Here your allegiance must shift from your allegiance to your ideas, your allegiance to your relationships, and your allegiance to certain trends in society to a greater allegiance to Knowledge within yourself. If this can be established, then Knowledge will show you how to give yourself into the world, show you where to make commitments and help you to discern those relationships that deserve your commitment and that benefit from it in an effective and constructive way.</p>
<p>在这里，你的忠诚必须从对你的想法、对你的关系、对社会某些趋势的忠诚，转变为对你内在内识的更伟大忠诚。如果这能够被建立起来，那么内识将告诉你如何把你自己给予这个世界，告诉你在哪里做出承诺，并帮助你辨识那些值得你做出承诺、并以一种有效和建设性的方式从中受益的关系。</p>
<p>Yet how difficult this is. This is a struggle, in a certain respect, for you must fight for your freedom. And what you fight primarily are the ideas that have been imposed upon you and that you have accepted. Here the struggle is more internal than external though there can be conflicts with other people, particularly those individuals who, by their intention or by their ignorance, thwart the emergence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>但这是多么困难。从某种意义上说，这是一场斗争，因为你必须为你的自由而战。你主要对抗的是强加给你的想法和你接受的想法。在这里，斗争更多的是内在的而不是外在的，尽管可能会与其他人发生冲突，特别是那些出于意图或无知而阻碍你内在内识出现的人。</p>
<p>Yet even if you were isolated and were out of contact with people, you would still see in your assessment of your own mental environment that there is a great deal of influence there that did not come from you. It came from your family; it came from your society; it came through your education. Some of it is beneficial; some of it is not. Some of it is helping you at this moment; some of it is not. Some of it enables you to see and know what you must see and know; some of it does not.</p>
<p>然而，即使你与世隔绝，不与人接触，你仍然会在评估你自己的心理环境时看到，那里有很多并非来自你的影响。它来自你的家庭；它来自你的社会；它来自你的教育。有些是有益的；有些不是。有些此刻对你有帮助；有些则没有。有些能让你看到和知道你必须看到和知道的事情；有些则不能。</p>
<p>Here there is a great deal of sorting out and some confusion as well. For you are shifting your sense of certainty from your ideas to Knowledge itself. You are saying, “My foundation is not simply a set of ideas or beliefs or associations,” and you are moving it to the real foundation within yourself, which is represented by the foundation of Knowledge.</p>
<p>这里有许多整理工作，也有一些混乱。因为你正在把你的确定感从你的想法转移到内识本身。你正在说：“我的基础不仅仅是一套想法、信仰或联系”，你正在把它转移到你内在的真正基础，它由内识的基础所代表。</p>
<p>The second great stage of learning regarding the mental environment has to do with learning how to cast influence within the mental environment. You cannot cast an influence within the mental environment in a conscious and effective way unless you have gained a certain amount of control over the mental environment in which you yourself function.</p>
<p>关于心理环境的第二个重要学习阶段是学习如何在心理环境中施加影响。除非你对你自己在其中运作的心理环境获得了一定程度的控制，否则你无法以有意识和有效的方式在心理环境中施加影响。</p>
<p>Developing this control requires focusing upon your own thinking and upon the relationships with which you have an immediate interaction and involvement. You cannot offset the mental environment of the whole world. You cannot offset the mental environment of the city in which you live. And perhaps you cannot even offset the mental environment of your family or your close group of relationships. But you can establish your own mental environment within it, and you are encouraged to take this responsibility and to become empowered to do so.</p>
<p>发展这种控制力需要关注你自己的思考以及与你有直接互动和参与的关系。你无法抵消整个世界的心理环境。你无法抵消你所居住城市的心理环境。或许你甚至无法抵消你的家庭或亲密关系群体的心理环境。但是你可以在其中建立你自己的心理环境，你被鼓励承担这个责任并获得这样做的力量。</p>
<p>Here you see an important difference between the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality and The Greater Community Way of Knowledge and many other spiritual teachings, which encourage you to give up this sense of authority, to give up this sense of responsibility over the management of your own mind and body. They encourage you to surrender—to surrender to ideas, to surrender to beliefs, to surrender to conventions or rituals, or to surrender to the Creator, or to the force and spirit of the Creator.</p>
<p>在这里，你看到大社区精神性、大社区内识之路和许多其他精神教导之间的重要区别，它们鼓励你放弃这种权威感，放弃这种管理你自己心灵和身体的责任感。它们鼓励你臣服——臣服于想法，臣服于信仰，臣服于惯例或仪式，或者臣服于造物主，或者臣服于造物主的势力和精神。</p>
<p>This difference creates considerable confusion, for people are not certain what their responsibility is. They are not certain what they are to give themselves to and from what they should hold themselves back. Let Us clarify this.</p>
<p>这种差异造成了相当大的混乱，因为人们不确定他们的责任是什么。他们不确定他们自己应该给予什么，又应该克制他们自己什么。让我们来澄清这一点。</p>
<p>In order to become a man or a woman of Knowledge, in order to become a spiritually realized Being within physical life, you must claim authority over your own affairs. The Creator will not do this for you, for the Creator has given you Knowledge to enable you to do this yourself.</p>
<p>为了成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人，为了在物质生命中成为一个精神上觉悟的存在，你必须对你自己的事务行使权力。造物主不会为你做这件事，因为造物主赋予你内识，让你自己去做这件事。</p>
<p>Here you must be the captain of your own ship. You cannot let the winds and the currents determine how you sail, and if you sail, and what you carry on board. Yes, you use the winds and the currents, but you must gain authority over your own ship in order to learn to do this. The captain of the ship does not simply let the winds and the currents take his or her ship wherever they may. Instead, he or she must learn how to control these forces and use them to gain direction and to move within the world.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须成为你自己船只的船长。你不能让风和水流决定你如何航行，是否航行，以及你在船上携带的物品。是的，你使用风和水流，但你必须获得对你自己船只的权威，才能学会做到这一点。船长不会简单地让风和水流把他的船带到任何地方。相反，他或她必须学会如何控制这些力量，并利用它们获得方向并在世界上前行。</p>
<p>Here there is a practical form of mastery, but here you do not claim to be the master, for Knowledge is the master, and the Creator is the master. But they can only work through you if you have developed strength and capability. If you are reckless or irresponsible regarding your physical interactions or mental interactions, Knowledge will not emerge within you, for you will not be ready.</p>
<p>这里存在着一种实用的掌控形式，但这里你并不声称自己是大师，因为内识是大师，造物主是大师。但只有当你发展了力量和能力时，他们才能通过你工作。如果你对你的物理互动或心理互动鲁莽或不负责任，内识就不会在你内在浮现，因为你还没有做好准备。</p>
<p>The Creator will not call you into service, for you will not be ready. You will not be given greater insight, greater ability, greater skills because you will not be ready. Therefore, the student of Knowledge becomes ready by gaining ability in their affairs with others, in their involvements in the world, and in developing their own mental environment.</p>
<p>造物主不会召唤你去服务，因为你还没有准备好。你不会获得更伟大的洞察力、更伟大的能力、更伟大的技能，因为你还没有准备好。因此，内识的学生通过获得与他人交往、参与世界以及发展他们的心理环境的能力来做好准备。</p>
<p>Now when I say developing your own mental environment, what does this really mean? Does this mean you put pretty pictures on your walls and play beautiful music all day long? Does this mean you burn incense and only have pleasant things to sense and smell and experience? No, it does not mean this.</p>
<p>现在，当我说发展你自己的心理环境时，这实际意味着什么？这是否意味着你在墙上贴上漂亮的画，整天播放美妙的音乐？这是否意味着你要焚香拜佛，只有令人愉悦的事情才能让你感知、闻到和体验到？不，它不是这个意思。</p>
<p>It means you learn to clear the way for Knowledge. It means you create a conducive environment mentally within yourself and in your immediate circumstances for Knowledge to emerge within you and to express itself through your life.</p>
<p>它意味着你学会为内识扫清道路。这意味着你在你自己的内心和当下的境况中创造一个有利的环境，让内识在你内心浮现并通过你的生命表达它自己。</p>
<p>Here you must open things up, clear things away, learn to recognize and offset negative influences, learn to recognize the degree to which you have been conditioned and affected by society and by your relationships, and to adjust them accordingly so that you have the freedom and the opportunity to find this greater Intelligence within you and allow it to emerge within your mind and within your life.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须开放一些事情，清理一些事情，学习认知和抵消负面影响，学习认知你受到社会和你的关系制约和影响的程度，并相应地调整它们，这样你就有自由和机会发现你内在的这种更伟大智能，并允许它在你的心灵里、在你的生命中呈现。</p>
<p>Within this short chapter, We will not attempt to describe all the dynamics of developing skill in the mental environment, for that is a very great subject and will require a much longer presentation. Yet it is important here for you to realize that you have a responsibility in terms of what you think and what you do, and you are held accountable for this.</p>
<p>在这短短的一章中，我们不会试图描述在心理环境中培养技能的所有动态，因为这是一个非常大的课题，需要更长的篇幅来阐述。然而，在这里，重要的是你要意识到，你对你的思考和行为负有责任，你必须为此负责。</p>
<p>The fact that you may feel swayed by forces greater than yourself, internal forces and external forces, does not deny the fact that you have a certain realm of responsibility. If you do not claim this responsibility, then other forces and powers will claim it for you. Let Us explain what We mean.</p>
<p>你可能会被比你自己更强大的力量所左右，无论是内部力量还是外部力量，这并不否认你有一定的责任范围。如果你不承担这个责任，那么其他力量和权力就会替你承担责任。让我们来解释一下我们的意思。</p>
<p>It is a fundamental truth in the universe, in the Greater Community in which you live and within the world in which you live, that if you do not claim authority over your life, then others will claim it for you. If you do not assume this responsibility, and if you do not garner the necessary wisdom, strength and skill that are required, then you will simply acquiesce to other forces. These other forces can be a dominating person in your life; they can be a dominating set of circumstances and relationships; they can be the predominating beliefs and ideals of your culture or your religion; and they can be forces from the Greater Community.</p>
<p>这是宇宙中、你所生活的大社区中以及你所生活的世界中的基本真理：如果你不宣称对你生命的权威，那么其他人就会替你宣称。如果你不承担这个责任，如果你不获得所需的智慧、力量和技能，那么你将只是默许其他力量。这些其他力量可能是你生命中占主导地位的人；它们可能是一组占主导地位的情况和关系；它们可能是你的文化或你的宗教中占主导地位的信仰和理想；它们也可以是来自大社区的势力。</p>
<p>As governments around the world want to keep their populations compliant and obedient, so the Greater Community presences within the world today, those who are interacting in human affairs, want to sway the thinking of humanity, want to direct human interest and human energy.</p>
<p>正如世界各国政府希望其民众保持顺从和服从一样，当今世界大社区的存在们，那些参与人类事务的种族，也希望影响人类的思维，希望引导人类的利益和人类的能量。</p>
<p>However, when you have skill in the mental environment, you recognize that the mental environment provides the greatest opportunity to exert influence and to produce the results that you want to produce.</p>
<p>然而，当你在心理环境中拥有技能时，你会认识到心理环境提供了最大的机会来发挥影响力并产生你想要的结果。</p>
<p>The Greater Community visitors in the world today who are interacting in human affairs do not want to destroy humanity, do not want to wipe humanity out, do not want to replace human beings with themselves, for that is not practical. Rather, they would have people respond to their ideas while hiding themselves as the sender of these influences so that human beings will in time learn to work according to how the visitors want them to work, to produce the resources and to produce the skills and to produce the biological and genetic materials that the visitors are seeking.</p>
<p>当今世界参与人类事务的大社区来访者并不想毁灭人类，不想消灭人类，不想用他们自己取代人类，因为这不切实际。相反，他们希望人们响应他们的想法，同时隐藏他们自己作为这些影响的发送者，这样人类最终就会学会按照来访者希望的方式工作，生产资源、生产技能，生产来访者正在寻找的生物和基因材料。</p>
<p>To make this possible, people must become compliant. They must [believe] in something that is at least conducive to the objectives that the visitors want to create for themselves. This becomes very subtle in its dynamics, but it is important for you to know that if you do not claim authority and ability in your own mental environment, if you do not learn to take responsibility for what goes on within your own mind and for your own behavior, then you will naturally acquiesce, not all at once but incrementally. You will simply be moved around by forces that you cannot possibly understand. And whether you acquiesce happily or whether you go along with great anger and resentment, you will be moved.</p>
<p>要做到这一点，人们必须变得顺从。他们必须相信某种至少有助于来访者为他们自己创造目的的事情。这在动态上变得非常微妙，但重要的是，你要知道，如果你不宣称你在你自己的心理环境中拥有权威和能力，如果你不学会为你自己的心灵和你自己的行为负责，那么你就会自然而然地默许，不是一下子，而是逐渐地。你只会被你不可能理解的力量所左右。无论你是愉快地默许，还是带着巨大的愤怒和怨恨顺从，你都将被左右。</p>
<p>How do you start? You start by learning The Way of Knowledge. You start by gaining a foundation within this deep and mysterious part of yourself. You begin by realizing that you are not free and that you want to become free—not just free of external restraints but free spiritually, free mentally, free to think, free to direct your energy, not according to the dictates or the will of others, but according to the reality and authority of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>你如何开始？你从学习内识之路开始。你从在你自己内心深处的神秘部分获得基础开始。你从认识到你并不自由，而你想要变得自由——不仅仅是摆脱外部束缚，而且是精神上的自由、心理上的自由、思考的自由、引导你能量的自由，不是根据他人的命令或意愿，而是根据你内在内识的现实和权威。</p>
<p>You begin with this understanding. Here you realize you do not really understand the mental environment. You do not really understand what Knowledge is yet or what it can do for you and the world. But you are at least aware that they exist, and you have a certain starting understanding that will enable you to proceed. Within the scope of this chapter and this book, We wish to give you this beginning understanding.</p>
<p>你从这种理解开始。在这里你意识到你并不真正理解心理环境。你还不真正理解内识是什么，或者它能为你和世界做些什么。但你至少知道它们的存在，而且你有一定的初步理解，这将使你能够继续前进。在本章和本书的范围内，我们希望给你这个初步的理解。</p>
<p>Now many people might say, “Well, I already know about these things. I know that people influence me, and I am trying to stop it!” But if this is your response, this does not yet recognize the real picture. Becoming defiant and angry does not mean that you are really developing skill and responsibility within your own mental environment.</p>
<p>现在许多人可能会说：“好吧，我已经知道这些事情了。我知道有人在影响我，我正在努力阻止它！”但是，如果这就是你的回答，那你还没有认识到真实的情况。变得挑衅和愤怒并不意味着你真的在你自己的心理环境中培养了技能和责任感。</p>
<p>It is easy to be angry and to lash out against the forces that you can recognize that are influencing everyone around you, such as institutions and governments and religions or the financial powers within your culture. But this does not mean you are claiming ability and responsibility.</p>
<p>你很容易生气，也很容易抨击那些你能认识到的影响你周围每个人的力量，比如机构、政府、宗教或你所在文化中的金融势力。但这并不意味着你在宣称你有能力和责任。</p>
<p>Becoming a rebel does not give you the power to create, and it is the power to create that We wish to emphasize here. For if you are to enter the second stage of development in gaining skill and ability in the mental environment, you must have the power to create, and what you will create will not be a product of your imagination. It will not be a product of your desires or your fantasies, but if truly understood and truly gained will be the creation of Knowledge within you. And here your greatest reality will begin to emanate through your life.</p>
<p>成为一个反叛者并不能赋予你创造的力量，而我们在此想要强调的正是创造的力量。因为如果你要进入发展的第二阶段，获得心理环境的技能和能力，你必须拥有创造的力量，而你将创造的事情将不是你想象的产物。它将不是你渴望或幻想的产物，而如果真正理解并真正获得它，那将是你内在内识的创造。在这里，你最伟大的现实将开始通过你的生命散发出来。</p>
<p>Now it is an amazing thing that individuals within your world who have gained these kinds of abilities are often hidden or withdrawn within their own societies. You might think that if you had this ability you would come forth and let your light shine for everyone, but that is not wise. That is not how Knowledge works.</p>
<p>现在，令人惊奇的是，你们世界里获得这些能力的人往往隐藏或退缩在他们自己的社会中。你可能认为，如果你拥有这种能力，你就会走出来，让你的光芒照亮每个人，但这并不明智。这不是内识运作的方式。</p>
<p>Knowledge does not overtake you and dominate you. Knowledge calls for you. It is hidden within you. It does not make a great show. Only if your life is threatened or you are in grave danger will it fully exert itself and manifest itself within your mind to overtake your actions and to rescue you. But in all other circumstances, it seems to remain hidden, distant, mysterious and yet an ever-present force within you.</p>
<p>内识不会超越你并控制你。内识会呼唤你。它隐藏在你的内心深处。它不会大张旗鼓。只有当你的生命受到威胁或处于严重危险中时，它才会充分发挥作用，在你的心灵中显现，超越你的行为并拯救你。但在所有其他情况下，它似乎仍然隐藏着，遥远而神秘，但却是你内心永远存在的力量。</p>
<p>The man or woman of Knowledge becomes like this in the world—present, effective but hidden. Why is this the case? Because there is much adversity in the world. The institutions, the prevailing attitudes and all those who believe in them and whose minds are fixed by them will be afraid of Knowledge and may even actively oppose its expressions.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人或女人在世界上就是如此——存在、有效但又隐匿。为什么会这样？因为世界上有许多逆境。制度、主流态度以及所有相信它们并被它们所束缚的人都会害怕内识，甚至可能积极反对它的表达。</p>
<p>Throughout the Greater Community, except in those communities of Knowledge, freethinking individuals are recognized as a threat, as something to watch out for, as something to be suspicious of, for they are exercising a greater power than government, a greater power than the power of institutions. They have a power greater than the greatest individual rulers living within the Greater Community. Only in a community of Knowledge will their example be encouraged and able to shine freely, but even these communities are relatively hidden within the Greater Community as a whole.</p>
<p>在整个大社区中，除了那些内识社区，自由思考的个体被视为一种威胁，需要警惕，需要怀疑，因为他们行使的权力比政府更大，比机构的权力更大。他们拥有比生活在大社区中最大的个体统治者更大的权力。只有在内识社区中，他们的榜样才会受到鼓励，并能够自由地发光，但即使是这些社区在整个大社区中也相对隐匿。</p>
<p>As We said at the beginning of Our book, this may be disappointing to many people who thought that advanced races represented a sort of spiritual kingdom, a spiritual reality without conflict, without greed, without manipulation. But this is confusing your Ancient Home with physical reality. It is always a mistake when you do that.</p>
<p>正如我们在书的开头所说，这可能会让许多人感到失望，因为他们认为先进种族代表着一种精神上的王国，一种没有冲突、没有贪婪、没有操纵的精神现实。但这混淆了你的古老家园和物质现实。这样做总是错误的。</p>
<p>The fact that the mental environment is so heavily used and manipulated within the Greater Community produces a greater requirement for you and for others who have real spiritual inclinations to develop skill within the mental environment.</p>
<p>心理环境在大社区里被如此频繁地使用和操纵的事实，对你以及其他具有真正精神倾向的人们产生了更伟大的要求，来发展心理环境里的技能。</p>
<p>However, at first you will do this for yourself. You will do this for yourself because you want to be free. You will do this for yourself because you want to be unencumbered. You will do this for yourself because you will want to know your own heart. You will do this for yourself because you want to have your own life. You do not want to simply be ruled mindlessly by forces that you cannot even recognize or understand.</p>
<p>然而，一开始你会为你自己这样做。你会为你自己这样做，因为你想要自由。你会为你自己这样做，因为你想要不受束缚。你会为你自己这样做，因为你想要知道你自己的内心。你会为你自己这样做，因为你想要拥有你自己的生命。你不想被你甚至无法认识或理解的力量盲目地统治。</p>
<p>Here you come to recognize there is great adversity. There are great obstacles in life to claiming this power and this ability. Though the Unseen Ones watch over you and encourage you, though you have great spiritual allies within the world and beyond, you still live in a world where Knowledge is not known, where Knowledge is not valued.</p>
<p>在这里，你认识到存在着巨大的逆境。生命中存在着巨大的障碍来要求这种力量和这种能力。尽管不可见者注视着你并鼓励着你，尽管你在世界内外拥有伟大的精神盟友，但你依然生活在一个内识不为人知、内识不被重视的世界里。</p>
<p>It is a world of law and conventions, of greed and power, yet it is also a world of goodness, a world of beauty and opportunity. But goodness, beauty and opportunity must contend with all the forces that oppose them and all the problems that these other forces have created for humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>它是一个充满法律和惯例、贪婪和权力的世界，但它也是一个充满善、美丽和机会的世界。但善、美丽和机会必须与所有反对它们的力量以及这些其他力量为整个人类造成的所有问题作斗争。</p>
<p>Therefore, do not be a dreamer. Become potent. Gain this ability to objectively review your own thoughts and inclinations and see if they come from Knowledge or are merely the product of your exposure to culture and to conventions.</p>
<p>因此，不要做梦想家。变得强大起来。获得这种能力，客观地审视你自己的思想和倾向，看看它们是来自内识，还是仅仅是你接触文化和习俗的产物。</p>
<p>How will you be able to do this? You will be able to do this by learning the Steps to Knowledge. You cannot simply make this happen overnight. How can you undo all your years of existence by a few simple techniques or by simply wanting to do it? You must have the methodology. You must have the right understanding. You must have the correct approach.</p>
<p>你要如何才能做到这一点？通过学习内识的进阶，你就能做到这一点。你不可能一夜之间就做到这一点。你怎么能通过一些简单的技巧或仅仅想这样做就毁掉你多年的存在？你必须有方法论。你必须有正确的理解。你必须有正确的方法。</p>
<p>Your study of The Way of Knowledge will give all of these to you. It will give you your inner authority. And it will give you all the responsibilities and all the challenges that go along with it. It will teach you about the mental environment because it will bring you to Knowledge.</p>
<p>你对内识之路的学习将为你带来所有这些。它将赋予你内在的权威。它将赋予你所有的责任和随之而来的所有挑战。它将教你关于心理环境的知识，因为它将带你走向内识。</p>
<p>Here you will see that within your mental environment and within the mental environments of wherever you go that you might be exposed to, there are forces that encourage the expression of Knowledge and there are forces that oppose it. As We have said, there are no neutral forces within the mental environment. Everything either helps or hinders your expression and your experience of this.</p>
<p>在这里，你会看到，在你的心理环境中，以及在你可能接触到的任何地方的心理环境中，都存在着鼓励内识表达的力量，也存在着反对内识表达的力量。正如我们所说，在心理环境中没有中立的力量。一切事物要么帮助你，要么阻碍你对此的表达和体验。</p>
<p>Of those forces that oppose the emergence of Knowledge within you, very little of this is truly evil. Many people oppose the expression of Knowledge simply because they do not know Knowledge exists, and they are afraid of their own inner inclinations. They are afraid to rock the boat. They are afraid to challenge their allegiances to people and to organizations and to beliefs. They are afraid to become free. They are afraid of the risks. They are afraid of what they believe they will lose.</p>
<p>在那些阻碍内识在你内在显现的势力中，很少有真正邪恶的。许多人反对内识的表达，仅仅是因为他们不知道内识的存在，他们害怕他们自己的内在倾向。他们害怕打破现状。他们害怕挑战他们对人们、对组织和对信仰的忠诚。他们害怕获得自由。他们害怕风险。他们害怕自己会失去他们所相信的东西。</p>
<p>And yet there are forces that are determined to keep humanity obedient, weak and indulgent. There are individuals committed to this. There are organizations committed to this. They cast a very great influence upon the mental environment of whole nations, upon the thought of whole populations. They seek to manipulate human weakness and inclinations for their own benefit.</p>
<p>然而，有些势力却决心让人类保持服从、软弱和纵容。有些个人致力于此。有些组织致力于此。他们对整个国家的心理环境、整个人口的思想施加了巨大影响。他们寻求操纵人类的弱点和倾向，以谋取他们自己的利益。</p>
<p>This manipulation of the mental environment has been going on within human societies throughout your history, and yet there are greater forces within the world now who have greater powers and skill within the mental environment. As We have said, they will focus their attention upon the governments and institutions that have the greatest effect upon the human population. And they will focus their intent and their interaction upon individuals everywhere who are vulnerable and who have certain gifts and sensitivities that they are seeking for themselves.</p>
<p>这种对心理环境的操控贯穿你们整个历史，在人类社会里一直都在发生，然而现在世界上存在着更强大的势力，他们在心理环境里拥有更强大的力量和技能。正如我们说过的，他们将把他们的注意力聚焦在对人类民众影响最大的政府和机构上。他们将把他们的意图和他们的互动聚焦在世界各地那些脆弱的、拥有他们为他们自己寻求的特定天赋和敏感性的个体上。</p>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking, “Oh, my, this is too much for me! I don’t think I can think of all these things. This is overwhelming!” But listen. It is not overwhelming. It is part of your experience right now.</p>
<p>此时，你可能会想：“天哪，这对我来说太难了！我想我无法想象所有这些事情。这太让人难以承受了！”但请听我说。这并不让人难以承受。它只是你现在经历的一部分。</p>
<p>We are giving you the power, the authority and the purpose to gain the abilities that you need, to gain the understanding that you must have to become and to do and to express what you came here to become, to do and to express—to be your true Self, to find your great inner harmony, to make a positive contribution to the world, and to realize your inherent nature and your association with your Spiritual Family.</p>
<p>我们赋予你力量、权威和目的，以获得你所需要的能力，获得你必须拥有的理解，从而成为、去做和表达你来此要成为、去做和表达的人——成为你真实的自我，找到你内在的伟大和谐，为世界做出积极贡献，并认识到你固有的自然以及你和你的精神家庭的关联。</p>
<p>Knowledge represents your greatest desire and your greatest need. The fact that you do not experience it today gives evidence in and of itself that you live in an environment that thwarts this discovery and does not support it, that you in the past have engaged in relationships that cannot support the emergence of Knowledge and would actively oppose it should you seek to become a student yourself.</p>
<p>内识代表着你最大的渴望和你最大的需求。你今天没有体验到内识，这个事实本身就证明你生活在一个阻碍和不支持内识发现的环境中，你过去所处的关系无法支持内识的出现，如果你自己寻求成为一名学生，他们甚至会积极反对内识的出现。</p>
<p>We are giving you power to deal with the influences in your life now and to understand these influences and to gain greater authority over your life and affairs. This is not too much for you. You have been conditioned to think that you are weak and ineffective. You have been conditioned to think that you can do very little and that you must simply go along with things as they are. You have been conditioned to think that you have very little inner authority and that the best thing you can do is try to be comfortable and avoid trouble.</p>
<p>我们正在赋予你力量，让你能够应对生命中的各种影响，理解这些影响，并取得对生命和事务的更大权威。这对你来说并不算太多。你已经被习惯认为你软弱无能。你已经被习惯认为你无能为力，只能顺其自然。你已经被习惯认为你几乎没有内在权威，你能做的最好的事情就是尽量安于现状，避免麻烦。</p>
<p>But you must outgrow this conditioning. You must break away from it. It is pervasive in the world today, and it will become increasingly so in the future as the Greater Community presences in the world seek to pacify humanity and to make it even more compliant and obedient, to make it even more vulnerable to control and manipulation within the mental environment.</p>
<p>但你必须超越这种制约。你必须摆脱它。它在当今世界无处不在，并且在未来会变得越来越如此，因为大社区在世界上的存在寻求安抚人类，使其更加顺从和服从，使其更加容易受到心理环境里的控制和操纵。</p>
<p>This is a call for you to awaken. This book is a call to awaken. Your awakening is what you must do to accomplish what you came here to accomplish. You live within both a physical and a mental environment. There are forces within both of these environments that affect you, and yet you can become effective in both of these environments as well.</p>
<p>这是对你醒来的呼唤。这本书就是对你觉醒的呼唤。你的觉醒是你必须做的事情，才能完成你来到这里要完成的事情。你生活在物理环境和心理的环境中。这两种环境中都有影响你的力量，但你也可以在这两种环境中发挥作用。</p>
<p>Engage with Knowledge. Clear the way for Knowledge to emerge within your life. Adjust your thinking and involvements with other people to make this possible, and you will speak with an authority that is greater than the world. You will have an authority that is more substantial and more complete and universal than any power, than any institution, than any government that you might encounter within the world or within the Greater Community.</p>
<p>与内识互动。为内识在你生命中的呈现扫清道路。调整你的思维和与他人的交往来实现这一点，你将带着一种比世界更伟大的权威发言。你将拥有一种比你在世界上或大社区里可能遇到的任何权力、任何机构、任何政府更实质性、更全面和更普遍的权威。</p>
<p>The Creator has given you this authority, but it is up to you to receive it and to learn what it means and to take the steps towards its reclamation and expression. The Creator cannot do that for you. The Unseen Ones who watch over you cannot do this for you. Do not abdicate this responsibility. This is your responsibility.</p>
<p>造物主赋予了你这个权力，但你必须接收它，学习它的意义，采取措施找回它并表达它。造物主无法为你做到这一点。守护着你的不可见者也无法为你做到这一点。不要放弃这个责任。这是你的责任。</p>
<p>This is what will make you strong. This is what will make you competent. This is what will enable you to develop discernment and discretion. This is what will refine your perception. This is what will teach you how to learn what is positive and helpful and what is not, both within your own mind and in the world around you.</p>
<p>这会让你变得强大。这会让你变得有能力。这会让你发展辨别力和判断力。这会让你的感知更加敏锐。这会让你学会如何学习什么是积极的、有益的，什么不是，无论是在你自己的心灵中，还是在你周围的世界中。</p>
<p>You become a man and woman of Knowledge by taking the Steps to Knowledge. There are many steps. Each one is important. Each one prepares for the next. Like climbing a great mountain, you do not go from the bottom to the top in a few giant leaps. Likewise, the Creator does not come and elevate you up to the top. No.</p>
<p>通过开展内识的进阶，你成为了内识男人和女人。内识有很多步骤。每一步都很重要。每一步都会为下一步做准备。就像攀登一座大山，你不可能从山脚到山顶，只用几步巨大的跳跃。同样，造物主也不会来把你抬到山顶。不。</p>
<p>You must make the journey. It is the journey that will make you strong. It is the journey that will make you wise. It is the journey that will give you what you really need and what you really want. And like journeying up a mountain, you will have to leave behind those people and those situations that cannot support your journey and that cannot enable it.</p>
<p>你必须踏上旅程。这是一段会让你变得强大的旅程。这是一段会让你变得明智的旅程。这是一段会给你带来你真正需要和真正想要内识的旅程。就像爬山一样，你必须离开那些无法支持你，无法使你实现旅程的人和情况。</p>
<p>Here you claim authority within yourself, and here you become responsible, or able to respond, to your deeper inclinations. Here you are a student of Knowledge whether you know it or not. Here you are learning the essential steps whether you know it or not.</p>
<p>在这里，你宣称你自己拥有权威，在这里，你变得有责任感，或者能够回应你内心的更深层次的倾向。在这里，无论你是否知道，你都是内识的学生。在这里，无论你是否知道，你都在学习必要步骤。</p>
<p>Yet sooner or later you will need a formal preparation, for there is only so much you can do for yourself. You cannot train yourself. You cannot take yourself where you have never gone. You cannot prepare yourself for a greater set of abilities to live in a greater reality.</p>
<p>然而，迟早你将需要一种正式的准备，因为你能为你自己做的事情是有限的。你无法训练你自己。你无法带你自己去你从未去过的地方。你无法让你自己为一套更伟大的能力做好准备，以生活在一个更伟大的现实中。</p>
<p>For this you need assistance. You need a method of study. You need a spiritual practice. And you need true relationships that can support you and assist you.</p>
<p>为此你需要援助。你需要一种学习方法。你需要一种精神实践。你需要真实的关系来支持你和帮助你。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge has been given to enable you to do this. It is not possible to become a man or woman of Knowledge and not learn about the mental environment and not gain authority and competence there. This will happen for you, but you must take the steps. This is your responsibility.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路已经被赋予，以使你能够做到这一点。你不可能成为一个内识的男人或女人，却不学习心理环境，不在心理环境中获得权威和能力。这将会发生在你身上，但你必须迈出步伐。这是你的责任。</p>
<p>There are great needs in the world today, greater than you realize. There are great forces in the mental environment who will seek domination over humanity and are doing so at this moment. There is a great need for men and women of Knowledge to keep Knowledge alive and to empower others so that humanity may maintain its integrity and its self-determination as it emerges into a greater and more complicated universe.</p>
<p>当今世界有着伟大的需求，比你意识到的还要伟大。心理环境中有着强大的力量，它们将寻求统治人类，并且此刻正在这样做。我们非常需要有内识的男人和女人来保持内识的活力，并赋予他人力量，以便人类在进入一个更大、更复杂的宇宙时，能够保持其完整性和自决权。</p>
<p>There is a great calling in the world today. You can feel it within yourself. It is not calling for someone else. It is calling for you. Do not look over your shoulder and say, “Well, someone had better respond to this!” It is you.</p>
<p>当今世界有一个伟大的召唤。你可以在内心深处感受到它。它不是在召唤别人。它正在召唤你。不要回头说：“好吧，最好有人对此作出回应！”它就是你。</p>
<p>You are the one responding to the call for Knowledge. You are the one responding to the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. This represents a deeper receptivity and a greater responsibility within you. Honor this. Support it. It is of the greatest importance.</p>
<p>你是回应内识召唤的人。你是回应世界向大社区迈进的人。这代表着你内心一种更深层次的接受能力和更伟大的责任。对此表示敬意。支持它。它是最重要的。</p>
