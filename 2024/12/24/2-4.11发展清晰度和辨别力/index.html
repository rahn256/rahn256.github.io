<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 5, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月5日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly, becoming aware of what you think and why you think what you think is directly connected to how you see what you see and what you value. If you are taught to think in a certain way, then you will only see certain things that are associated with that, and this will help determine what you value.</p>
<p>当然，察觉到你在想什么以及你为什么这样想，直接与你如何看待你所看到的事物以及你所珍视的事物相关。如果你被教导以某种方式思考，那么你将只会看到与之相关的特定事物，这将有助于决定你所珍视的事物。</p>
<p>Much of your prior education was devoted to this, but We are beginning now a new education, a fundamental education. This represents your second great education in life. Your first education was to learn to become a functional human being so you could participate within the world. But this is only a first stage. The second great stage in education is the reclamation and the expression of Knowledge, the great knowing Mind that lives within you. Each of these forms of education is very complete, but they are only indirectly related.</p>
<p>你之前接受的大部分教育都致力于此，但我们现在开始的是一种新的教育，一种基础教育。这是你生命中第二次伟大的教育。你的第一次教育是学会成为一个有功能的人，这样你才能参与到这个世界中来。但这只是第一阶段。教育的第二个伟大阶段是内识的回收和表达，内识是你内在伟大的知道心灵。每一种教育形式都非常完整，但它们只是间接相关的。</p>
<p>Your first education to become a functional human being, to become socially integrated, to become socially determined and to become socially interactive is not aimed at you becoming a man or a woman of Knowledge. Instead, it is aimed at you becoming a productive member of society. Everything you have learned about the history and the meaning of human existence primarily has been aimed to produce this result. This is an education you have gained living in isolation in the world, and as a result your education has mostly been focused upon human interests, human activities, human history and human ideals.</p>
<p>你接受的最初教育是要成为一个有功能的人，融入社会，具有社会决心，具有社会互动性，这并不是为了让你成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人。相反，它的目的是让你成为一个有生产力的社会成员。你所学到的关于人类存在的历史和意义的一切主要都是为了产生这个结果。这是你在孤立的生活中获得的教育，因此你的教育主要集中在人类的利益、人类的活动、人类的历史和人类的理想上。</p>
<p>Yet your second great education in life is the reclamation and the expression of Knowledge. This is when your spiritual emergence begins. This is what it really means to become reborn. It is like a new beginning. And just like when you began life as a small child, you start out very uncertain, very shaky in your foundation, and you enter a brave new world with new influences and new things to consider. You are not leaving your life. You are not going anywhere. But you are penetrating the whole other part of life, which you are not encouraged to learn about in your prior education.</p>
<p>然而你生命中的第二个伟大教育是内识的找回和表达。这是你精神崛起的开始。这才是重生的真正意义。它就像一个新的开始。就像你作为一个小孩开始生命时一样，你一开始非常不确定，基础非常不稳固，然后你进入一个勇敢的新世界，有新的影响和新的事情需要考虑。你不是离开你的生命。你不是去任何地方。但你正在渗透生命的整个另一部分，这是你之前所受的教育不鼓励你去学习的。</p>
<p>Part of your second great education is learning a greater discernment and a greater perception. To develop this discernment and perception, you must become aware of things that you were not aware of before. You must become responsive to things within yourself and in your environment that you were not encouraged to see or interact with previously.</p>
<p>你的第二个伟大教育的一部分是学习一种更伟大的辨识力和一种更伟大的感知。为了发展这种辨识力和感知，你必须察觉到你以前没有察觉到的事情。你必须对你自己内在和环境中以前不鼓励你看到或互动的事情做出回应。</p>
<p>While your first great stage of education did not hold as a goal for you to become a man or a woman of Knowledge, it is true that your second stage of education does require that you have become socially integrated and developed, but only to a certain degree. For if you could not function in the world, then Knowledge could not work through you. If you do not know how to get along with people at all, then Knowledge could not exert its beneficial presence within your relationships. If you could not accomplish anything in human society, then how could Knowledge contribute through you within that society?</p>
<p>虽然你教育的第一个重要阶段的目标并不是成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人，但你教育的第二个阶段确实要求你融入社会并得到发展，但只是在一定程度上。因为如果你不能在世界上运作，那么内识就无法通过你运作。如果你根本不知道如何与人相处，那么内识就无法在你的人际关系中发挥它的有益作用。如果你在人类社会中什么都做不了，那么内识又如何通过你在这个社会中做出贡献呢？</p>
<p>In other words, you need a certain foundation in order to begin the great study and reclamation of Knowledge. You need a certain foundation to have a spiritual emergence occur within your life. This does not mean that you are totally socially integrated or that you accept all social mandates or that you get along with everyone wonderfully or that you believe in all of the great ideals of your society. Not at all. But it does mean that you are capable of participating, that you are able to participate and that you are competent to communicate and interact with others.</p>
<p>换句话说，你需要一定的基础，才能开始内识的伟大学习和找回。你需要有一定的基础，才能在你的生命中实现精神崛起。这并不意味着你完全融入社会，或者你接受了所有的社会任务，或者你与每个人都相处得很好，或者你相信你所在社会的所有伟大理想。完全不是这样。但它确实意味着你有能力参与，你能够参与其中，你有能力与他人沟通和互动。</p>
<p>Within yourself, you may be a great rebel against the very fabric of society as it is manifested today, but it is important as far as Knowledge is concerned that you are able to participate within that society. If you were completely alienated, if you could not express yourself, then the possibility for the great Spirit to work through you would be very limited.</p>
<p>在你自己的内心深处，你可能是当今社会结构的一个伟大反叛者，但就内识而言，重要的是你能够参与到这个社会中。如果你完全被疏远，如果你无法表达你自己，那么伟大的精神通过你工作的可能性就会非常有限。</p>
<p>Here Knowledge uses all things you have learned before to focus your life in a new direction. Here Knowledge does not destroy what you have learned but gives it a greater employment and a greater focus. This demonstrates one of the great laws of life—that the Creator does not destroy, but instead re-employs.</p>
<p>在这里，内识使用你之前学到的所有事情，将你的生命聚焦在一个新的方向。在这里，内识不会摧毁你所学到的事情，而是给予它更大的用途和更大的针对性。这证明了生命的伟大法则之一——造物主不会摧毁，而是重新雇用。</p>
<p>The whole idea that the Creator would punish you for your sins is utterly ridiculous and has no validity in reality. That is the creation of religious institutions in order to engender obedience and conformity in its followers. The Creator re-employs; the Creator does not destroy. Whatever you have created in life, however full of error, however misapplied your efforts may have been, Knowledge will show you a way to use what you have learned in a new and constructive way.</p>
<p>认为造物主会因你的罪孽而惩罚你的整个想法完全是荒谬的，在现实中毫无根据。这是宗教机构的创造，目的是让其追随者服从和顺从。造物主会重新雇用；造物主不会毁灭。无论你在生命中创造了什么，无论你犯了多少错误，无论你的努力有多么错误，内识都会向你展示一种以新的建设性方式运用你所学到的东西的方法。</p>
<p>Therefore, Knowledge will take what you have learned in terms of discernment, in terms of perception, and build upon that. It will build upon your accomplishments rather than deny them. It will validate what you have achieved thus far rather than discourage you. Though you may need to take an entirely different tack in life, though you will be venturing into an entirely new kind of living, you will use what you have gained thus far, for nothing will be wasted.</p>
<p>因此，内识将吸收你在辨别力和感知方面所学到的东西，并在此基础上进一步发展。它将巩固你的成就，而不是否定它们。它将肯定你迄今为止所取得的成就，而不是让你气馁。尽管你可能需要采取一种完全不同的生命方针，尽管你将冒险进入一种全新的生活方式，但你将使用你迄今为止所获得的一切，因为没有什么是浪费的。</p>
<p>Here your life becomes really validated as it finds a greater application and a greater meaning. Here your past will be used to create a future of greater proportions and greater benefit. Here the shadows that have hung over you will be cast aside as the real content of your life finds new expression, meaning and value. Here you will begin to see the world in a new way. Here you will gain a greater discernment of what you are looking at and what you are interacting with.</p>
<p>在这里，你的生命得到真正认可，因为它找到了一种更伟大的应用和更伟大的意义。在这里，你的过去将被用来创造一个更伟大、更有益的未来。在这里，笼罩着你的阴影将被抛到一边，因为你生命的真正内容找到了新的表达、意义和价值。在这里，你将开始以一种新的方式看待世界。在这里，你将对你正在观察的事物和你正在与之互动的事物有一种更大的辨别力。</p>
<p>The man or the woman of Knowledge is always looking. Whereas everyone else is always judging, the man or woman of Knowledge is always looking. They want to see because real seeing is connected with real Knowing. You will more often see and then know rather than know and then see, but they do both go together.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人或女人总是在观察。尽管其他人总是在评判，但有内识的男人或女人总是在看。他们想要看到，因为真正的看见与真正的知道是相连的。你更多的时候是先看后知，而不是先知后看，但两者确实是相辅相成的。</p>
<p>To really know the meaning and purpose of your life, you must get high enough up the mountain so that you can see the panorama of your experience. Otherwise, you will just have beliefs, and beliefs are removed from reality. The best thing a belief can do is help you to interpret reality, but the belief is not reality itself.</p>
<p>要真正知道生命的意义和目的，你必须登上足够高的山峰，才能看到你经历的全景。否则，你只会有信仰，而信仰与现实脱节。信仰能做的最好的事情就是帮助你解读现实，但信仰不是现实本身。</p>
<p>Many people have never gone beyond their beliefs. They have never found Knowledge in a real and substantial way, and so they do not see that there is life beyond their beliefs. There are even people who think that life is belief—whatever you believe is what you will live and experience. But this is only valid at the level of perception.</p>
<p>许多人从未超越过他们的信仰。他们从未以真实而实质性的方式发现内识，因此他们看不到信仰之外还有生命。甚至有人认为生命就是信仰——你相信什么，你就会活出什么，体验什么。但这只在感知层面上有效。</p>
<p>There is actually a reality beyond your beliefs. It is this reality that you must find and become engaged with. Here beliefs are like the glasses that you wear. They either help you see or they do not. They are either the right prescription for you or they are not. And over time, your perception will change.</p>
<p>实际上，除了你的信念之外，还有一种现实。你必须找到并参与其中。在这里，信念就像你戴的眼镜。它们要么帮助你看清事物，要么没有。它们要么适合你，要么不适合。随着时间的推移，你的看法会发生改变。</p>
<p>Therefore, your ideas and beliefs need to be flexible and adaptable. They are only temporary expediencies to help you see and to help you know. You cannot live without belief because you have a mind that thinks, that needs beliefs to organize its thoughts and to become stable. But belief, when it is directed by Knowledge, is very different from belief that is directed only by the mind.</p>
<p>因此，你的想法和信念需要灵活和适应性。它们只是暂时的权宜之计，帮助你看清现实，帮助你知道真理。没有信念你就活不下去，因为你有一颗会思考的心灵，需要信念来组织思想并变得稳定。但当信念受到内识的引导时，它与仅受心灵引导的信念截然不同。</p>
<p>For example, you can believe in something very firmly and be very identified with your belief, but your Being may have nothing to do with it. For example, people will become married to another person because of what they believe about that person, but their Being is not getting married. People walk down the aisle and make their vows and commit all of their resources to a relationship in which their Being has absolutely no involvement whatsoever. Though this sounds crazy, it happens all the time.</p>
<p>例如，你可以非常坚定地相信某件事，并非常认同你的信仰，但你的存在可能与它无关。例如，人们会因为他们对另一个人的相信而与那个人结婚，但他们的存在不会结婚。人们走上红毯，许下誓言，把所有的资源投入到一段他们的存在绝对不参与的关系中。虽然这听起来很疯狂，但它一直在发生。</p>
<p>That is just trying to live life without Knowledge. That is trying to make commitments without Knowledge. That is trying to govern what you believe without Knowledge.</p>
<p>这只是试图在没有内识的情况下生活。这只是试图在没有内识的情况下做出承诺。这只是试图在没有内识的情况下控制你所相信的。</p>
<p>But with Knowledge as the foundation, belief becomes then a tool of perception, a means of greater discernment. Here your ideas change, not simply because change is important but because you need to be able to see—you need to be able to use your ideas and your beliefs to see more clearly, to know more clearly, to be able to discern what you are dealing with in the world.</p>
<p>但有了内识作为基础，信念就会成为一种感知的工具，一种更伟大辨别力的方法。在这里，你的想法会改变，不仅仅是因为改变很重要，而是因为你需要能够看清——你需要能够运用你的想法和你的信念来更清晰地看清，更清晰地知道，能够辨识你在世界上面对的是什么。</p>
<p>It could be said that all human error is the result of poor discernment. And poor discernment is the result of not being engaged with Knowledge sufficiently. For Knowledge will reorganize your ideas and will redirect your perception. As I have said, it will not destroy what you have learned but will give it a new focus and a new relevancy.</p>
<p>可以说，人类的所有错误都是辨别力差的结果。而辨别力差是没有充分参与内识的结果。因为内识将重组你的想法，并将重新引导你的感知。正如我所说，它不会摧毁你已经学到的东西，而是会给它一个新的焦点和一个新的相关性。</p>
<p>Here it seems like you are starting out for the first time. You will feel like a rank beginner, but at the same time you will be drawing upon everything you have learned thus far. But it will be different. You will feel different. The experience will be different. What you see will be different. What you will sense, what you will know will be different.</p>
<p>在这里，你似乎第一次开始。你会觉得自己像个初学者，但同时，你会使用迄今为止学到的一切。但情况会有所不同。你的感受会有所不同。体验会有所不同。你看到的会有所不同。你的感受、你的知道会有所不同。</p>
<p>The first great stage of your education taught you what to see and what to look for and what to value. But in the second great stage of your education, in the reclamation of Knowledge, you will learn to see and value something entirely new and something far more meaningful. But the fact that you have learned how to see, that you are capable of seeing, is the result of the first stage of your education. This now is being brought into a greater arena of life and given a greater employment.</p>
<p>你教育的第一个重要阶段教会了你要看什么、要寻找什么、要珍视什么。但在你教育的第二个重要阶段，在内识的重新获得中，你将学会看和珍视一些全新的、更有意义的事物。但事实上，你已经学会了如何看，你有能力看，这是你教育的第一个阶段的结果。现在，这被带入生命的一个更伟大的舞台，并被赋予了更伟大的用途。</p>
<p>It is a remarkable thing how little people see. You will find this in your own experience as you come to realize how little you have seen. People are literally unaware of great things happening in their lives. They are unaware that they are making critical mistakes. They are unaware of great opportunities. They are unaware that there are important alternatives to what they are seeing and what they are believing. They are unaware that they are violating Knowledge in many of their engagements and associations, and yet they feel all the discomforts that are the result of this. And rather than going to the source of the discomfort, they seek for more pleasure, or they take pills, or they try to reinforce old ideas, or they try to lose themselves in constant outer activity.</p>
<p>令人惊讶的是，人们能看到的事情是如此之少。当你逐渐意识到你自己曾经看到的有多么有限时，你会在你的经历中发现这一点。人们实际上对他们生活中发生的重大事件毫无察觉。他们没有察觉到他们正在犯下严重的错误，他们没有察觉到伟大的机会正在面前，他们也没有察觉到，在他们所看到和相信的之外，还存在着重要的替代选择。他们没有察觉到，在许多参与和关系中，他们正在违背内识，但他们却感受到因此带来的所有不适。而不是追溯不适的根源，他们寻求更多的享乐，或者服用药物，或者试图强化旧的观念，或者试图将他们自己迷失在不断的外部活动中。</p>
<p>It is remarkable that people do not see, but it is also tragic. Human suffering in all of its manifestations that you see throughout the world, much of it is the result of not seeing and not knowing and not being able to respond appropriately to what is happening in life.</p>
<p>人们没有看到这一点是令人惊讶的，但这也是悲剧。你在世界各地看到的人类苦难，其表现形式很多都是因为没有看到、不知道以及不能对生命中发生的事情做出适当的回应。</p>
<p>Certainly, there is suffering that is the result of a lack of food, a lack of medicine, a lack of the basic necessities of life. But beyond this, the great psychological suffering that you see is the result of a lack of discernment, which in turn is the result of a lack of Knowledge. Knowledge has not been allowed to emerge sufficiently within these individuals, as they have not been able to adapt to the changing circumstances of their lives.</p>
<p>当然，缺乏食物、缺乏药品、缺乏基本生命必需品会造成痛苦。但除此之外，你所看到的巨大心理痛苦是缺乏辨别力的结果，而辨别力又是缺乏内识的结果。内识未能充分地在这些个体身上显现，因为他们无法适应生命中不断变化的环境。</p>
<p>What is real seeing? Real seeing is seeing what is there. It is not just seeing what you want to see. It is not just seeing what you like. It is not just seeing what you are afraid of. It is not just seeing according to the prevailing attitudes and beliefs in your mind. It is being able to see through the mind. Here the mind is either a window or a wall. It is either a maze that is impenetrable or it becomes a refined telescope.</p>
<p>什么是真正的看见？真正的看见就是看见存在的内识。它不只是看见你想看见的东西。它不只是看见你喜欢的东西。它不只是看见你害怕的东西。它不只是根据你心灵中普遍的态度和信念来看见。它能够看透心灵。在这里，心灵要么是一扇窗户，要么是一堵墙。它要么是一座无法穿越的迷宫，要么成为一架精巧的望远镜。</p>
<p>It is possible for you to see what is really there, to have a direct experience. We call this direct experience when you see what is really there. For a moment you are clicked out of your own thoughts and preoccupations long enough to have a direct experience of something outside yourself. This is very important. This reconnects you with the world. It reconnects you with other people. And it reconnects you with the changing circumstances of your life and gives you an opportunity to gain a different vantage point from which to see and to act.</p>
<p>你有可能看到真正存在的内识，获得直接的体验。当你看到真正存在的内识时，我们称之为直接体验。在片刻之间，你会摆脱你自己的思想和专注，有足够的时间直接体验你自己之外的事物。这非常重要。这会让你与世界重新建立联系。它让你与其他人重新建立联系。它让你与生命中不断变化的环境重新建立联系，让你有机会获得不同的视角来观察和采取行动。</p>
<p>The most effective way of developing direct experience, and as a result gaining a new perspective and greater discernment, is becoming a student of Knowledge. Why? Because when you engage with Knowledge, you engage in life as it is actually happening at this moment within you. You engage with the Source of the life force within yourself, which is directly engaged or connected to the larger events that are happening in the world.</p>
<p>发展直接体验，从而获得新的视角和更伟大的辨别力的最有效方法是成为一名内识的学生。为什么？因为当你接触内识时，你接触的其实是你此刻内在正在发生的生命。你接触的是你自己内在生命力的源泉，它直接接触或关联着世界上正在发生的更大事件。</p>
<p>This takes you out of your self-preoccupation. This takes you out of your obsessions with yourself and your particular interests. This frees you from the restraints in your own mental environment and from the mental environment of your culture as a whole. This brings you out of yourself, out of your mind, and into life as it is really happening.</p>
<p>这会让你摆脱自我关注。这会让你摆脱对你自己和特定兴趣的执着。这会让你摆脱你自己心理环境和整个文化心理环境的束缚。这会让你摆脱你自己，摆脱你的心灵，进入实际发生的生命。</p>
<p>Now life itself will sometimes dump cold water on you, and you will find yourself in a situation to which you will have to respond. These situations are almost always redemptive, but they can be very difficult and very costly. Why become aware and awake only under great adversity when the opportunity is there for you every day? Why wait until your problems become so severe and so demanding that you must respond to them in a state of emergency, usually at great cost to yourself? Why wait until catastrophe comes when it could have been avoided at the outset?</p>
<p>现在，生命本身有时会给你泼冷水，你会发现你自己处于必须做出反应的境地。这些情况几乎总是有救赎的，但它们可能非常困难，代价也非常高昂。既然每天都有机会，为什么只在巨大的逆境中才意识到并醒来呢？为什么要等到你的问题变得如此严重和如此棘手，以至于你必须在紧急状态下应对它们，通常要付出巨大的代价？为什么要等到灾难来临时，而灾难本来可以从一开始就避免呢？</p>
<p>Real seeing and real knowing go together. One can follow the other, but they always go together. Out of this comes effective action, dynamic action. Out of this comes revitalization of your body and greater health as a result.</p>
<p>真正的看和真正的知是相辅相成的。两者可以相继而生，但两者总是相辅相成的。由此产生有效的行动、动态的行动。由此产生身体的活力和更健康的结果。</p>
<p>Knowledge only sees what is important to see. As you learn to see with Knowledge, you learn to penetrate the surface of things, the manifestations of things. You learn to penetrate the prevailing attitudes and beliefs under which you have labored all these years, and you gain discernment. What is discernment again but seeing what is really there, discerning what is important to discern?</p>
<p>内识只看到那些重要的事情。当你学会用内识去看的时候，你就学会了看透事物的表面，看透事物的表现。你学会了看透这些年来你一直努力坚持的主流态度和信念，并且获得了辨别力。辨别力又是什么呢？不就是看到真正存在的内识，辨别出那些重要的事情吗？</p>
<p>Perception, then, can either simply be a mechanism for projecting the prevailing attitudes in your mind and using them to attempt to understand life around you, or perception can become a means of engaging with life as it really is. The former promotes and deepens self-obsession and self-absorption. The latter brings you into life, into a dynamic engagement.</p>
<p>因此，感知既可以简单地成为一种机制，将普遍的态度投射到你的心灵中，并试图用它们来理解周围的生命；也可以成为一种方法，让你参与到实际的生命中去。前者助长并加深了自我沉迷和自我陶醉。后者则将你带入生命，带入充满活力的参与中。</p>
<p>You have already suffered self-obsession and all of its debilitating effects. If that is not enough to convince you, simply look at life around you. Human beings, so gifted and so intelligent, are living under such dismal psychological and physical conditions.</p>
<p>你已经遭受了自我痴迷及其所有令人衰弱的影响。如果这还不足以说服你，那就看看你周围的生命吧。人类如此有天赋和聪慧，却生活在如此悲惨的心理和生理条件下。</p>
<p>You can blame life. You can blame the government. You can blame your parents. You can blame whatever you want to blame. But the responsibility is yours ultimately, for you are the one who can change what you see. You are the one who can find out what you know. You cannot change what you know because you cannot change Knowledge, but you can enable Knowledge to reveal itself to you and to show you how to engage with life in a truly effective and meaningful way. Let Us talk about this.</p>
<p>你可以责怪生命。你可以责怪政府。你可以责怪你的父母。你可以责怪任何你想责怪的。但最终责任在于你，因为你是能够改变你所看到的一切的人。你才能发现你所知道的一切。你无法改变你所知道的，因为你无法改变内识，但你可以让内识向你揭示它自己，并向你展示如何以一种真正有效和有意义的方式参与生命。让我们来谈谈这个。</p>
<p>In looking with Knowledge, there is no right and no wrong. There is instead yes or no. Knowledge is not constantly involved in judging and evaluating people and situations. It is simply trying to get you where you need to go and help you find those people you need to find to get where you need to go. Knowledge is on a mission in life. It is trying to bring you into the mission that has brought you into the world, for only here will you find fulfillment and real happiness.</p>
<p>用内识来看，没有对错。只有是或否。内识不会不断地评判和评估人和情况。它只是试图把你带到你需要去的地方，帮助你找到那些你需要找到的人，以到达你需要去的地方。内识在生命中肩负着使命。内识试图把你带入把你带到这个世界的使命中，因为只有在这里你才能找到满足感和真正的幸福。</p>
<p>It is not just sitting by the side of the road, judging everything that comes along. It is not a spectator in life. It is an active participant. And it is the catalyst for change and redemption.</p>
<p>它不是坐在路边，评判沿途发生的一切。它不是生命的旁观者。它是一位积极的参与者。它是改变和救赎的催化剂。</p>
<p>Many people look at Spirit in a very passive way as if it were something out there floating around in space. It is something that is just being, like a lightbulb in the ceiling, just sending out light everywhere. It is noninvolved. It is totally detached. If things go well, if things do not go well, what does it matter? It is like the sun above the clouds. It shines regardless of the conditions below.</p>
<p>许多人以一种非常被动的方式看待精神，好像它是某种漂浮在太空中的东西。它只是存在，就像天花板上的灯泡，只是向四周发出光芒。它不参与。它完全超脱。如果事情进展顺利，如果事情进展不顺利，那又有什么关系呢？它就像云层之上的太阳。无论下面的条件如何，它都会发光。</p>
<p>But this perception of Spirit is really not correct. Only if you are trying to get out of life would you foster such a perception. But Knowledge is trying to bring you into life. It may have to get you out of life temporarily in order to give you a different vantage point, in order to enable you to re-evaluate your ideas and your priorities, but its intention is to bring you into life, to engage you with life, because that is why you have come.</p>
<p>但这种对精神的感知其实并不正确。只有当你试图逃离生命时，你才会培养这种感知。但内识正试图把你带入生命。它可能需要暂时让你逃离生命，以便给你一个不同的视角，以便让你重新评估你的想法和优先事项，但它的意图是让你进入生命，让你参与生命，因为这就是你来到这里的原因。</p>
<p>You did not go through all the trouble to get here simply to become a bystander, simply to watch the parade. You came here to make things happen. You came here to accomplish things, not only for yourself but for the whole world. Your gift and contribution is primarily for others.</p>
<p>你不辞辛劳来到这里，不只是为了当一个旁观者，不只是为了观看游行。您来到这里是为了让事情发生。你来到这里是为了成就一番事业，不仅是为了你自己，也是为了整个世界。你的礼物和贡献主要是为了他人。</p>
<p>So when Knowledge looks in the world, it does not say, “That is good and that is bad.” No, it says, “yes,” and “no,” yes meaning this is helpful for the discovery and expression of your purpose or no, this is not helpful. As a result, Knowledge does not condemn. It does not judge and cast people into Hell.</p>
<p>因此，当内识审视世界时，它不会说“那是好的，那是坏的”。不，它会说“是”和“不是”，“是”意味着这对发现和表达你的目的有帮助，或者“不是”，这没有帮助。因此，内识不会谴责。它不会评判并将人们投入地狱。</p>
<p>This whole notion of God judging and the Final Judgment and you being cast into purgatory is completely a fabrication of the mind. Its only connection to reality is that if you are not connected with Knowledge, you are sort of living in a purgatory every day. You are living without certainty. You are living without a greater conscience. You are living without direction. You are living without wisdom. You are like a car careening down the mountainside without any brakes, out of control. This is Hell enough.</p>
<p>上帝审判和最终审判以及你被打入地狱的整个概念完全是心灵的虚构。它与现实的唯一联系是，如果你不与内识相连，你每天都会生活在地狱中。你的生活没有确定性。你活在没有良知的世界里。你的生活没有方向。你没有智慧地活着。你就像一辆没有刹车的汽车，失控地从山坡上冲下来。这已经够地狱了。</p>
<p>God is re-employing. God is emphasizing a greater purpose. God is speaking through Knowledge to you. That is your connection with God. God does not appear at the foot of your bed. That only happens in movies. God is speaking through Knowledge to you, reminding you that you came here for a purpose, reminding you that you want to accomplish something here, reminding, reminding, reminding you of your true nature and mission.</p>
<p>上帝在重新就业。上帝在强调一个更伟大宗旨。上帝在通过内识对你讲话。这是你与上帝的联接。上帝不会出现在你的床脚。那只会发生在电影里。上帝在通过内识对你讲话，提醒你，你来到这里是为了一个目的，提醒你，你想在这里完成某件事，提醒、提醒、提醒你，你的真实自然和使命。</p>
<p>God is not trying to take you out of the world. God is trying to get you into the world to do something for life. This is what redeems you. This is what restores your value. This is what turns your past from a painful record, a failure and disassociation into a real meaningful engagement with life. This is what transforms everything that has been created in the world into something good and beneficial. A great part of this transformation is the transformation of perception.</p>
<p>上帝并不是想把你带离这个世界。上帝是想让你来到这个世界，让你为生命做一些事情。这才是救赎你的事情。这才是恢复你价值的事情。这才是将你的过去从痛苦的记录、失败和分离转变为对生命的真正有意义的投入的事情。这才是将世界上创造的一切转化为美好和有益的事情的内识。这种转变的很大一部分是感知的转变。</p>
<p>Looking with Knowledge, then, you are able to see beyond appearances. You are able to see beyond your own ideas even. You are able to see things that your previous beliefs would not let you see. You are able to entertain alternatives. You are able to see elements within your mental and physical environment that you simply could not interact with before.</p>
<p>那么，用内识去看待，你就能看透表象。你甚至能看透你自己的想法。你能看到你以前的信念不允许你看到的事情。你能够考虑其他选择。你能够看到你心理环境和物理环境中你以前根本无法与之互动的元素。</p>
<p>Knowledge will teach you how to see, what to see and how to engage with things in a productive and effective way. This will be very different from your obsessions, your beliefs and your attitudes and your compulsions—fundamentally different. For you will be seeing from a greater vantage point within yourself, and as you learn to see in this way, you will develop new eyes and a new consciousness.</p>
<p>内识将教你如何看待、看什么以及如何以富有成效和有效的方式参与事物。这将与你的痴迷、你的信仰、你的态度和你的冲动截然不同——根本上不同。因为你将从你内在的一个更伟大的视角来看，当你学会以这种方式看待时，你将发展出新的眼光和一种新的意识。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you knows that the world is emerging into the Greater Community. This may be very different from your beliefs, but Knowledge is not affected by your beliefs. It knows that it knows. That is why it is Knowledge. It cannot be swayed. It cannot be corrupted. It cannot be disengaged from itself.</p>
<p>你内在的内识知道世界正在步入大社区。这可能与你的信念截然不同，但内识不受你信念的影响。它知道就是它知道。正因为如此它才是内识。它不会被动摇。它不会腐化。它不会脱离它自己。</p>
<p>This is why it represents a source of power and integrity within you, for as you become close to Knowledge, as you begin to feel the effects of Knowledge more and more, both within the mundane activities of your life and within your greater understanding of where you are going and what you are doing, you will begin to share its attributes. Your sense of invulnerability will grow, and with it your discernment of the world will grow as well.</p>
<p>正因为如此，它代表着你内在力量和完整性的一个源泉，因为当你开始接近内识时，当你开始越来越多地感受到内识的影响时，无论是在你生命的日常活动中，还是在你对你去往何处和你在做什么的更伟大理解中，你将开始分享它的属性。你的无敌感将增长，随之而来的是，你对世界的辨识力也将增长。</p>
<p>Here you will not be preoccupied with all kinds of meaningless things. Instead, your mind will become quiet and still. Your vision will become penetrating. Instead of answering your own questions, you will look for the answer in life. While Knowledge is trying to bring you into the world in a real way, it does not encourage you to try to find all your answers within yourself because most of your answers will be found in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，你不会专注于各种毫无意义的事情。相反，你的心灵将变得安静和静止。你的视野将变得敏锐。你不会回答你自己的问题，而是在生命中寻找答案。虽然内识试图以一种真实的方式把你带入世界，但它并不鼓励你试图在你内心寻找所有的答案，因为你的大多数答案都将在世界上找到。</p>
<p>Though the answer already lives within you, it must be connected to the real events in which it can be expressed and become relevant. This brings you back into the world. This frees you from self-obsession, which is the source of all mental illness.</p>
<p>尽管答案已经在你心中，但它必须与实际事件联系起来，这样它才能得到表达并变得有意义。这会让你回到这个世界。这会让你摆脱自我痴迷，而自我痴迷是所有心理疾病的根源。</p>
<p>In studying Steps to Knowledge, the method of study in learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, your mind is taught how to become still. This is a fundamental skill. It is a skill that is taught in many of the world’s traditions. [Stillness] is necessary to gain discernment, for if your mind is racing or caught up with its own ideas, how can you see anything?</p>
<p>在学习内识进阶——学习大社区内识之路的学习方法时，你的心灵被教导如何保持静止。这是一项基本技能。这是世界上许多传统中教授的技能。静止对于获得辨别力是必不可少的，因为如果你的心灵飞速运转或被它自己的想法所困扰，你如何能看到任何事情呢？</p>
<p>People look. They do not see. Why? Because they are not being present. Why are they not present? Because they are caught up in their own thinking. It is like the television is running in their mind all the time, and they cannot seem to break away from it. So how can they see anything? How can they feel anything? They are disassociated from the world, and as a result can easily become manipulated.</p>
<p>人们看，却看不见。为什么？因为他们不在场。为什么他们不在场？因为他们陷入了他们自己的思维。它就好像电视一直在他们的心灵中播放，他们似乎无法摆脱它。因此，他们如何能看到任何事情呢？他们如何能感觉到任何事情呢？他们与世界脱节，因此很容易被操纵。</p>
<p>It is easy to manipulate someone who is obsessed. It is difficult to influence someone who is present. It is easy to manipulate someone who is dominated by their own ideas. It is difficult to influence someone who is looking beyond themselves.</p>
<p>操纵一个执着的人很容易。影响一个在场的人却很难。操纵一个被他们自己的想法所支配的人很容易。影响一个超越他们自己视野的人却是困难的。</p>
<p>This is why those visitors from the Greater Community who are interacting in human affairs do not support the reclamation of Knowledge. They do not want human beings to become powerful and observant because [then human beings] cannot be used; they cannot be influenced. They become a far greater adversary here.</p>
<p>这就是为什么那些来自大社区、参与人类事务的来访者不支持内识的开垦。他们不希望人类变得强大和敏锐，因为[那样的话]人类就无法被利用；他们无法被影响。他们在这里变成了一个更强大的对手。</p>
<p>Here you may have a greater calling than even your visitors. If you can reclaim Knowledge and with it discernment and perception, then you have something to teach them, if they are able to learn. And all their great technology and even all of their ability to influence the mental environment will not be comparable to the cultivation of Knowledge within the human mind. This is humanity’s only defense and your most important asset in both gaining a real practical mastery within your own life and in preparing for the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>在这里，你甚至可能比你们的来访者有更伟大的召唤。如果你能够重新获得内识，以及随之而来的辨别力和感知，那么你就有东西可以教给他们，如果他们能够学习的话。他们所有的伟大技术，甚至他们影响心理环境的所有能力，都无法与人类心灵中内识的培养相提并论。这是人类唯一的防御手段，也是你自己生命中获得真正的实际驾驭能力以及为大社区本身做好准备的最重要资产。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you looks at your visitors and comprehends their intent, sees their strengths, sees their weaknesses, understands the elements that are governing their mental environment, comprehends their lack of freedom, comprehends their skill and reads everything objectively, just as it is.</p>
<p>你内在的内识会观察你们的来访者并理解他们的意图，看到他们的优势，看到他们的劣势，理解支配他们心理环境的因素，理解他们缺乏自由，理解他们的技能，并且客观地解读一切，就像它本来的样子。</p>
<p>But people in the world, if they are aware of this at all, think, “Oh, they are angels! They are spiritually enlightened and coming to rescue us and to teach us the ways of enlightenment. This will be the end of war and conflict forever.” Or they think, “Oh, they are coming here to devour us! They are going to destroy us! They are going to have us for dinner! They are going to overtake us!” This is not seeing. This is only projecting one’s own beliefs and attitudes upon a situation that one cannot discern clearly.</p>
<p>但世人如果察觉到这一点，就会想：“哦，他们是天使！他们精神上是开悟的，是来拯救我们的，教导我们启蒙之路。战争和冲突将永远终结。”或者他们会想：“哦，他们来这里是为了吞噬我们！他们要毁灭我们！他们要把我们当晚餐吃掉！他们要超越我们！”这不是看清现实。这只是把自己的信念和态度投射到自己无法清楚辨别的情形上。</p>
<p>In the mind of the believer, visitors from the Greater Community must either be angels or demons because any power from the skies must either be angelic or demonic. And so the visitors are conceptualized as either angelic or demonic forms. But this is not seeing. This is not having discernment. This is simply projecting one’s prevailing ideas and beliefs. This is not looking to see what is really there. This is only projecting what one believes to give one a sense of stability and security in light of a whole new experience. Knowledge sees what is there. Belief only sees itself.</p>
<p>在信徒的心灵中，来自大社区的来访者要么是天使，要么是恶魔，因为任何来自天空的势力要么是天使，要么是恶魔。因此，来访者被概念化为天使或恶魔的形式。但这不是在看。这不是在具有辨别力。这只是投射一个人的主流想法和信念。这不是在寻找真正存在的现实。这只是投射一个人的信念，以便在全新体验的光照下给人一种稳定感和安全感。内识看到存在的事情。信仰只看到它自己。</p>
<p>As you come to feel the great need for Knowledge within your life—the need for certainty, the need for clarity, the need for a sense of real purpose and mission in life—you also come to recognize how much you need to be able to see clearly and be present to what is happening around you.</p>
<p>当你开始感受到你生命中对内识的伟大需求——对确定性的需求、对清晰性的需求、对生命真正的目的感和使命感的需求时——你也会认识到你多么需要能够看清并关注你周围正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>Most of the mistakes you have ever made in life were the result of not being present and not being discerning. You were somewhere else in your mind when something happened. You did not see it coming. And perhaps afterwards you felt, “Oh, life is so hard on me! I had such bad luck today,” but you did not see it coming.</p>
<p>你生命中犯下的大部分错误都是因为心不在焉和缺乏辨别力。当某事发生时，你的心灵在别的地方。你没有预料到它的到来。也许事后你会觉得，“哦，生命对我来说太艰难了！我今天运气真差”，但你没有预料到它的到来。</p>
<p>People do not end up where they are simply by chance. They end up there either because they intended to be there in a conscious way or they were not present while other things were setting their course for them.</p>
<p>人们不会因偶然而到达他们现在的处境。他们之所以到达那里，要么是因为他们有意识地想要到达那里，要么是因为他们没有在场，而其他事情正在为他们设定路线。</p>
<p>How many people make pivotal decisions in life without being really aware of what they are doing? And how can you not be aware of what you are doing unless you are preoccupied in your own thoughts and are not engaged with what is really happening around you?</p>
<p>有多少人做出生命中的关键决定时，并没有真正察觉到他们在做什么？除非你专注于你自己的思想，不关心周围实际发生的事情，否则你怎么可能不知道你在做什么呢？</p>
<p>People get married every day, not realizing who they are marrying, what they are getting themselves into, what the responsibilities are. But they are willing to sacrifice so much. And others say, “Well, you have to take your chances in life!”</p>
<p>每天都有人结婚，却不知道他们嫁给了谁，会陷入什么境地，要承担什么责任。但他们愿意做出如此多的牺牲。而其他人则会说：“好吧，你必须在生活中抓住机会！”</p>
<p>But the more intelligent you are, which means the closer you are to Knowledge and the more discerning you are, you realize you take fewer chances, but you also realize the chances are more significant. It becomes more important not to make critical mistakes, especially repeat ones you have made before. You do not take such a casual attitude towards things that have such grave consequences.</p>
<p>但你越聪慧，意味着你越接近内识，你越有辨别力，你就会意识到你冒的风险越少，但你也会意识到机会更重要。不要犯重大错误，尤其是不要重复你以前犯过的错误，这一点变得更加重要。你不会对后果如此严重的事情采取如此漫不经心的态度。</p>
<p>Developing discernment and clear perception, then, begins with being still. To be still you have to be present, and you have to learn how to disengage from your own mind. This is a great training in and of itself. This is not easy, but every little step of advancement you make here yields so much to you.</p>
<p>因此，培养辨别力和清晰的感知始于保持静止。要保持静止，你必须在场，你必须学会​​如何摆脱你自己的心灵。这本身就是一种伟大的训练。这并不容易，但你在这里取得的每一点进步都会给你带来巨大的收益。</p>
<p>Every little accomplishment gives you a sense of discernment, a sense of awareness, a sense of capability that simply was not there before. And, yes, your mind will keep on judging and evaluating because your mind works like a machine. Until it can gain service to the greater power within you, it seems to be like a runaway train.</p>
<p>每一个小小的成就都会给你一种辨别力、一种觉知感、一种能力感，而这些感觉以前是没有的。而且，是的，你的心灵会继续判断和评估，因为你的心灵就像一台机器一样运转。除非它能为你内心更伟大的力量服务，否则它就像一列失控的火车。</p>
<p>But more and more, you are able to step aside from it. More and more, you are able to see over its manifestations. More and more, you are able to take a second look. You step back. You look. You do not answer your own questions. You look. You wait. You become still.</p>
<p>但是，你越来越能够置身事外。你越来越能够看清它的表现形式。你越来越能够多看一眼。你退后一步。你看。你不回答你自己的问题。你看。你等待。你变得静止。</p>
<p>The animals do this every day. They watch. They become still. They watch. They give their full awareness to what they are seeing. But for human beings, this is very difficult, for their minds are overactive. Their imaginations have no context, so they are creating scenarios constantly until people end up living more in the world of imagination than in the world of reality. They cannot distinguish what they are thinking from what is actually happening.</p>
<p>动物每天都在这样做。它们观察。它们静止不动。它们观察。它们全神贯注于所见之物。但对于人类来说，这非常困难，因为他们的心灵过于活跃。他们的想象力没有背景，所以他们不断地创造场景，直到人们最终更多地生活在想象的世界而不是现实世界中。他们无法区分他们所想的和实际发生的事情。</p>
<p>This is a grave disability and one that is very serious, particularly in terms of the Greater Community presences in the world and humanity’s emergence into a Greater Community of life. But you experience this disability every day.</p>
<p>这是一种严重的残疾，而且非常严重，特别是就大社区在世界上的存在以及人类进入生命大社区而言。但你每天都会经历这种残疾。</p>
<p>As We have said, you will begin the reclamation of Knowledge and the development of real discernment primarily for yourself at first. And then you will realize over time that you really are not just doing this for yourself, that if you did it for yourself, you would not exert the energy and the effort required. But instead you are doing this for the world, for something greater. This solidifies your commitment to the truth and gives you greater skill in discerning the truth.</p>
<p>正如我们说过的，你首先将是为了你自己而开始寻回内识并发展真正的辨识力。然后随着时间的推移，你将意识到你实际上并非只是为了你自己而做这件事，如果你是为了你自己而做这件事，你就不会付出所需的能量和努力。相反，你是为了世界而做这件事，为了某件更伟大的事情。这巩固了你对真理的承诺，并赋予你辨识真理的更伟大技能。</p>
<p>When you look at things in the world in a conscious way, ask yourself, “What am I seeing? Is this beneficial? Should I become engaged with this? Should I say anything? Is this important?”</p>
<p>当你有意识地观察世界上的事物时，问问你自己：“我看到了什么？这有益吗？我应该参与其中吗？我应该说什么吗？这重要吗？”</p>
<p>Now you will notice that all of these questions call for either a yes or a no answer. This is a very good way of questioning because this tends to bypass the mind, which has great difficulty in dealing with questions like this, and goes to Knowledge, which simply knows.</p>
<p>现在你会注意到所有这些问题都需要一个是或否的答案。这是一种非常好的提问方式，因为它倾向于绕过心灵，心灵很难处理这样的问题，而转向内识，内识只是知道。</p>
<p>The mind takes a basic question and turns it into a complex series of considerations, which may have little to do with what you are dealing with directly. So while the mind goes on and on and on, trying to use all of its criteria, Knowledge knows.</p>
<p>心灵会把一个基本问题变成一系列复杂的考虑，而这些考虑可能与你直接处理的问题没有多大关系。因此，当心灵不断地思考，试图运用它所有的标准时，内识就会知道。</p>
<p>Sometimes the mind’s criteria are important; often they are not. But to develop a new kind of seeing, you must learn to go beyond the mind, at least temporarily. In the future, you will need to use the mind, but right now you do not have the strength to use the mind, for you are used to having it use you. So to gain a greater sense of authority and ability, you must learn to bypass the thinking mind.</p>
<p>有时，心灵的标准很重要；但通常它们并不重要。但要培养一种新的观察，你必须学会​​超越心灵，至少暂时如此。将来，你需要使用心灵，但现在你没有力量使用心灵，因为你习惯了让心灵使用你。因此，要获得更大的权威感和能力，你必须学会​​绕过思维的心灵。</p>
<p>This is only part of the training, for there are many ways to find what you know. Sometimes you find this by bypassing the mind. Sometimes you find this by going through the mind and the mental processes of which you are aware. But the answer is always beyond the mind.</p>
<p>这只是训练的一部分，因为有很多方法可以找到你所知道的内识。有时你会绕过心灵找到它。有时你会通过心灵和你所知道的心理过程找到它。但答案总是超越心灵。</p>
<p>As you learn to become still, this will quiet your mind and teach you how to see beyond it and to see through it. As you learn to do this, you will be able to see and engage more clearly and directly with what is happening around you. Here your beliefs are secondary. You are trying to see what is there. And if you are patient and do not try to answer your own questions, you will go through a series of real breakthroughs in your perception. This will have an immense effect on all aspects of your life.</p>
<p>当你学会变得静止，你的心灵会安静下来，并教会你如何超越它、看透它。当你学会这样做时，你将能够更清晰、更直接地看到并参与周围发生的事情。在这里，你的信念是次要的。你试图看到那里有什么。如果你有耐心，不试图回答你自己的问题，你的感知就会经历一系列真正的突破。这将对你生命的各个方面产生极大影响。</p>
<p>Ultimately, this will prepare you to engage with the Greater Community because you will be able to see with Knowledge, and will not be fooled by the appearances of things, and will not be governed by your preferences. This gives you power and certainty within the mental environment, for just like in your physical environment, Knowledge is not fooled by the appearance of things.</p>
<p>最终，这将让你做好参与大社区的准备，因为你将能够用内识去看，不会被事物的表象所愚弄，不会被你的偏好所支配。这在心理环境中赋予你力量和确定性，因为就像在你的物理环境中一样，内识不会被事物的表象所愚弄。</p>
<p>The closer you are to Knowledge, the stronger you are with Knowledge, the more Knowledge is directing you, the more you will have this great clarity, this great perception and the more discerning you will become. As a result of this, you will become a great benefactor to others. You will teach them how to see, how to know, how to become still, how to become discerning. You will teach this through demonstration, and you will teach this through all the things that you advocate and that you support in life.</p>
<p>你越接近内识，你的内识就越强大，内识越多地指引你，你就越拥有这种伟大的清晰性、这种伟大的感知，你就越有辨识力。因此，你将成为他人的一个伟大贡献者。你将教他们如何看、如何知道、如何变得静止、如何变得有辨别力。你将通过示范来教导这一点，你将通过你在生命中提倡和支持的所有事情来教导这一点。</p>
<p>Humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of life. The need for discernment, the need for clear perception now is greater than it has ever been. The failure to develop these essential qualities within yourself will not simply be a personal tragedy for you but will engender a greater tragedy for humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>人类正在步入一个生命的大社区。现在比以往任何时候都更需要辨别力和清晰的感知。如果你不能在你自己身上发展这些基本品质，那将不仅仅是你个人的悲剧，而且会给整个人类带来更大的悲剧。</p>
<p>When you look with Knowledge, you look without fear, and you look without preference. As a result, you do not promote fear and preference within yourself. This is the beginning of true objectivity, something that is very, very difficult to achieve in life. And yet the possibility for achieving this is so much greater now because of the presence of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>当你用内识去观察时，你会毫无恐惧地观察，毫无偏好地观察。因此，你不会在内心滋生恐惧和偏好。这是真实客观的开始，而这在生命中是非常非常难以实现的。然而，由于大社区内识之路的存在，实现这一点的可能性现在大得多。</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Teaching that enables you to see and to know. This is its foundation. It teaches you how to become still and observant. It teaches you how to connect with things on the outside without being swept up by your own thoughts and beliefs. And yet even beyond this, it teaches you how to see with a greater vision, the greater vision that one would have as a result of living in a Greater Community of life. It teaches you how to see beyond your isolation as a human being within the world. It teaches you a Greater Community perception, awareness and understanding.</p>
<p>最后，有一种教导能够让你看见和知道。这是它的基础。它教导你如何变得静止和善于观察。它教导你如何与外界事物联结，而不被你自己的思想和信念所左右。然而甚至除此之外，它教导你如何用更伟大的视角去看，这种更伟大的视角是一个人生活在一个生命大社区中所能拥有的。它教导你如何超越你作为世界上的人类的孤立去看。它教导你一种大社区的感知、觉知和理解。</p>
<p>To participate in the Greater Community, you must have great discernment. You must develop some skill in the mental environment. And if you are to truly be a positive force in life, you must become a man or woman of Knowledge. There is only one preparation in the world today that can enable you to do all of these things. It is called The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. It is presented through the sacred texts, Steps to Knowledge and Wisdom from the Greater Community [and the other books of the New Message.]</p>
<p>为了参与大社区，你必须拥有伟大的辨别力。你必须发展一些心理环境方面的技能。而如果你真的想成为生命中的积极势力，你必须成为一个内识的男人或女人。当今世界只有一种准备能够让你做到所有这些事情。它被称为大社区内识之路。它通过神圣文本、内识的进阶以及来自大社区的智慧[以及新讯息的其他书籍]呈现。</p>
<p>The preparation is here. The need is great. Your need is great. You cannot afford to continue to stumble blindly forward in life, hoping that good things will happen for you, but disconnected and unaware of the greater events that are shaping your future, your experience and your destiny. How can you afford this when the means for gaining vision, gaining insight and developing discernment are now available to you?</p>
<p>准备就在这里。需求是伟大的。你的需求也是伟大的。你不能继续在生命中盲目地跌跌撞撞地前进，只是寄希望于美好的事情会发生，却与那些正在塑造你未来、经历和天命的重大事件脱节且毫无察觉。当获得远见、洞察力以及培养辨别力的方法现在已经向你敞开时，你又怎能承受继续如此下去呢？</p>
<p>Yet this preparation will take much patience. You cannot undo decades of habits and years and years of social conditioning in a day, a week or a month. The transformation of your vision and your awareness is something that happens in steps and stages. And yet the calling is in the world to undertake exactly this preparation.</p>
<p>然而，这种准备需要很大的耐心。你不可能在一天、一周或一个月内消除几十年的习惯和多年的社会条件。你的视觉和你觉知的转变是分步和阶段发生的。然而，世界正在召唤你进行这种准备。</p>
<p>There is no time now for ambivalence. There is no time now for self-obsession. There is no time now to indulge yourself in your small pleasures. There is only time now to develop your greatest abilities, to become the person you really are, to gain the rewards of Knowledge, the skills of Knowledge, and to help humanity learn to see its condition, its influences and its destiny.</p>
<p>现在没有时间犹豫不决。现在没有时间自我沉迷。现在没有时间沉溺于小乐趣。现在只有时间发展你最伟大的能力，成为真正的你，获得内识的回报、内识的技能，并帮助人类学会看清它的状况、它的影响和它的天命。</p>
<p>Knowledge will give you this vision. Knowledge will become your eyes. Knowledge will teach you to become still and penetrating, open and compassionate. Knowledge will generate its own mental environment within your mind and within the sphere of your life. Then your life will become a contribution, for Knowledge will emanate from you and around you. And others will learn to see as a result of being in your presence.</p>
<p>内识将赋予你这种视觉。内识将成为你的眼睛。内识将教你变得静止而敏锐、开放而富有同情心。内识将在你的心灵中、在你的生命领域里产生它自己的心理环境。然后你的生命将成为一种贡献，因为内识将从你身上散发出来并围绕着你。而其他人将通过与你同在而学会看清事物。</p>
<p>Yet this can only happen if you undertake the Steps to Knowledge, if you prepare in The Way of Knowledge, if you take all the steps that are necessary to regain your vision, to refine your perception and to develop your discernment. This is what awaits you and this is what We offer.</p>
<p>然而，只有当你开展内识进阶，当你在内识之路上做好准备，当你采取一切必要步骤来重拾视野、完善感知和发展辨别力时，这一切才会发生。这就是等待你的，也是我们所提供的。</p>
