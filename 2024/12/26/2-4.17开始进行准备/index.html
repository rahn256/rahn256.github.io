<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 6, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月6日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The message that We are presenting in this book is of the greatest importance, and yet you must find out for yourself. You must discover what you know, and you must be able to see the world clearly. You must be able to see with your own eyes—not the eyes of your culture, not the eyes of your religion, not the eyes of your family, not the eyes of your friends, but with your own eyes and with the greater Mind that is within you.</p>
<p>我们在这本书中呈现的讯息至关重要，然而你必须自己去发现。你必须发现你所知道的内识，你必须能够清楚地看清世界。你必须能够用你自己的眼睛去看——不是用你的文化的眼睛，不是用你的宗教的眼睛，不是用你的家人的眼睛，不是用你朋友的眼睛，而是用你自己的眼睛，用你内在的更伟大心灵。</p>
<p>What We are presenting in this book is obvious if you can see it, but if you cannot see it, it is not obvious. If you cannot relate to it, then it is beyond your reach. If you cannot consider it, then you are lost to it.</p>
<p>如果你能看见它，我们在这本书中呈现的内容是显而易见的，但如果你看不到，它就是不明显的。如果你无法理解它，那么它就超出了你的理解范围。如果你无法考虑它，那么你就失去了它。</p>
<p>This is not some subtle event happening in the world. This is something that is permeating the mental environment in human civilization. This is a phenomenon that is occurring all around the world. But the governments of the world keep it hidden. They are trying to understand, but they do not realize their own vulnerability. The religions of the world cannot account for it, and may not even hold it to be real.</p>
<p>这不是世界上发生的一些微妙事件。这是渗透到人类文明心理环境的事情。这是世界各地都在发生的现象。但世界各国政府都将其隐藏起来。他们试图理解，但他们没有意识到他们自己的脆弱性。世界上的宗教无法解释它，甚至可能不认为它是真实的。</p>
<p>So where do you go for validation? Where do you go for instruction? How do you find your way? How can you come to know the meaning of the world’s evolution and your fundamental relationship with it?</p>
<p>因此，你从哪里寻求确认？你从哪里寻求指导？你如何找到你的道路？你如何才能知道世界进化的意义以及你与它的根本关系？</p>
<p>For this, you must assume a greater authority in life. You must realize that no one else can do this for you. The preparation is being provided. It is being made available to people all around the world. It is something they must study on their own. Yes, they will need help along the way, but they must assume the responsibility to become educated about the Greater Community and to learn the way to Knowledge.</p>
<p>为此，你必须承担起生命中更大的权威。你必须意识到没有人能为你做到这一点。准备工作正在提供。它正在被提供给世界各地的人们。这是他们必须为他们自己学习的事情。是的，他们一路上将需要帮助，但他们必须承担起责任，受到大社区的教育，去学习通往内识的道路。</p>
<p>We are giving you, then, tremendous responsibility and authority within your own life, more than you have ever assumed before. And yet We are giving you this right and this recognition with the understanding that it requires a tremendous amount of preparation and responsibility.</p>
<p>因此，我们赋予你在你自己的生命中伟大的责任和权威，比你以前承担的还要多。然而，我们赋予你这种权利和认知，是出于这样的理解：这需要大量的准备和责任。</p>
<p>You cannot simply mindlessly assume [you have] it and carry on because you will not find your way. And instead of learning the reality of life and the meaning of your position in the world, you will simply generate your own beliefs and ideas, which come largely out of your imagination and your social conditioning.</p>
<p>你不能只是盲目地假设你拥有它并继续下去，因为你找不到你的路。你不会学习生命的现实和你在世界上位置的意义，而只会产生你自己的信念和想法，而这些信念和想法主要来自你的想象和社会条件。</p>
<p>The way is not hard, but it is different, and it requires a lot of honesty. Here you must step aside from the persuasions of your friends, your family and the institutions with which you may be allied or involved and develop your own vision and understanding, not based upon what you want, or what you are afraid of, or what other people expect of you, but based upon Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>这条路并不难，但它是不同的，它需要很多诚实。在这里，你必须抛开你的朋友、你的家人以及你可能结盟或参与的机构的劝说，发展你自己的视野和理解，不是基于你想要什么，你害怕什么，或者其他人对你的期望，而是基于你内在的内识。</p>
<p>We are confident that if you can make this approach, and cultivate your honesty, and develop your skills, and patiently learn The Way of Knowledge as it is being offered to you that you will be able to see with your own eyes, and you will be able to have your own experience.</p>
<p>我们相信，如果你能采取这种方法，培养你的诚实，发展你的技能，并耐心学习向你提供的内识之路，你将能够亲眼看到，并且你将能够拥有你自己的经验。</p>
<p>In time, you will realize how necessary this is for you and for the world in which you live. This will give you a sense of mission, a sense of direction in life, and you will begin to realize your real gifts and where they must be given.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，你会意识到这对你和你生活的世界有多么必要。这会给你一种使命感、一种生命方向感，你会开始意识到你真正的礼物以及应该把它们奉献给哪里。</p>
<p>Everyone in the world has an important role to play. If they can find this foundation within themselves and develop the necessary honesty and discernment, they will find their contribution and they will find it in the world.</p>
<p>世界上每个人都有重要的角色。如果他们能够在他们自己内在找到这个基础，并培养必要的诚实和辨别力，他们就会找到他们的贡献，也会在世界上找到它。</p>
<p>There must be service in the world at every level of human activity, but if it can be rendered with this greater understanding—this understanding of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community, the need for humanity to gain greater cooperation and integration, the need to develop intelligence, the need to care for people—then humanity will be able to make great strides and will find a new foundation within a larger arena of intelligent life.</p>
<p>在世界上，人类活动的每一个层面都必须有服务，但如果能够以这种更伟大的理解来提供服务——这种对世界向大社区迈进的理解，对人类获得更伟大合作和整合的需要的理解，对发展智能的需要的理解，对关爱人类的需要的理解——那么人类将能够实现伟大的进步，并将在更广阔的智能生命舞台上找到一个新的基础。</p>
<p>The conditions are perfect for this. The conditions require this. It is not simply an option anymore; it is a vital necessity. Just like finding Knowledge within you is a vital necessity. Allow your life to become vital and necessary and you will begin to feel that you are vital and necessary. This is where you discover your power. This is where you tap into your greater energy. This is where you dispel all self-abuse and all negative attitudes towards yourself.</p>
<p>条件非常适合这样做。条件需要这样做。这不再只是一种选择；而是一种至关重要的必要性。就像在你内心寻找内识是一种至关重要的必要性一样。让你的生命变得至关重要和必要，你就会开始感觉到你是至关重要和必要的。这就是你发现你的力量的地方。这就是你发掘你更伟大能量的地方。这就是你消除所有自我虐待和对你自己的所有消极态度的地方。</p>
<p>Here you take a humble yet real approach to the meaning and value of your existence, for you see that there is something you can do here, given what you have and given what you have developed already, and that you do not have to become a superman or a superwoman, but instead become a man or a woman of Knowledge. It is possible for you to do this. It is needed for you to do this. It is necessary.</p>
<p>在这里，你以一种谦逊而又真实的态度来对待你存在的意义和价值，因为你看到，凭借你所拥有的和你已经发展的基础，你可以在这里做一些事情，你不必成为一个超人或女超人，而是成为一个内识的男人或女人。你有可能做到这一点。你需要这样做。它是必要的。</p>
<p>Just take the first step. Knowledge does not ask you to leap off the cliff into the unknown. That is not The Way of Knowledge. The Way of Knowledge is to follow step by step, follow the path before you, keep your eyes open, keep your ears open, try to keep your mind free of assumptions, come to recognize your blind sides and your weaknesses. Build your strengths and you will advance and progress.</p>
<p>只需迈出第一步。内识不会要求你从悬崖上跳入未知世界。这不是内识之路。内识之路是一步一步地追随，沿着你面前的道路前行，睁大眼睛，竖起耳朵，试着让你的心灵中没有假设，认识到你的盲点和弱点。建立你的优势，你就会进步和发展。</p>
<p>Though you may not see the advancement day in and day out, you will notice a fundamental shift in your awareness and your experience: a deepening of your sensitivity, a sharpening of your abilities, greater objectivity about your life and abilities, strengths and weaknesses and a clearer understanding of other people’s intentions and their own problems that they must overcome within themselves.</p>
<p>尽管你可能不会日复一日地看到进步，但你会注意到你的觉知和体验发生了根本性的转变：你的敏感度加深了，你的能力增强了，对你的生命和能力、优点和缺点更加客观，对其他人的意图和他们自己必须克服的问题有了更清晰的理解。</p>
<p>As you journey forth, you will develop greater compassion, for you will realize that this requires tremendous focus and strength—a focus and strength that you actually have and must now utilize. You will understand why others falter and why others are ambivalent, even to receive the gifts that the Creator has given to them.</p>
<p>当你继续前行时，你将发展出更大的同情心，因为你将意识到这需要极大的专注和力量——你实际上拥有并且现在必须善用的专注和力量。你将理解为什么其他人会动摇，为什么其他人会犹豫不决，甚至不愿意接受造物主赋予他们的礼物。</p>
<p>You will understand why people look but do not see. You will see all the mechanisms of denial, and you will begin to see the degree of social conditioning and the extent of influence that is now being perpetrated in the mental environment [on] people everywhere.</p>
<p>你将理解为什么人们去看却看不见。你将看到所有的否认机制，你将开始看到社会条件的程度，以及心理环境对世界各地人们产生的影响的程度。</p>
<p>Here you will work and fight for your own freedom internally, and you will want to provide freedom [for] others—freedom from manipulation, freedom from influence, freedom from the past, freedom from the wretched conditioning that so many people labor under today.</p>
<p>在这里，你将为你自己内在的自由而努力和奋斗，你将想要为他人提供自由——免于操纵的自由，免于影响的自由，免于过去的自由，免于当今许多人所受的悲惨条件的自由。</p>
<p>You will want freedom, but you will want something even greater than freedom, and that is the ability to be connected to the world, to be fully involved in life and to bring the greater endowment of Knowledge that you have, and all the gifts that are associated with it, into active demonstration in the world.</p>
<p>你将想要自由，但你将想要某种比自由更伟大的内识，这就是与世界联接的能力，充分参与生命的能力，把你所拥有的更伟大内识禀赋，以及与之相关的所有礼物带进世界上的积极展示中的能力。</p>
<p>All of this is waiting for you. Indeed, it is calling for you. It is saying, “Come, come! Awaken out of your preoccupations. There is something important for you to do.”</p>
<p>这一切都在等着你。事实上，它正在召唤你。它正在说：“来吧，来吧！从你的烦恼中醒来吧。有一件重要的事情正等待着你去做。”</p>
<p>And if you are broken down by the side of the road, and you do not know what to do or where to go, or you are not sure of your strength, or you are doubting your ability or your value, this is the calling that will get you moving again. For your life must be moving. If it is not moving, it will begin to sink. That is not good.</p>
<p>如果你在路边崩溃了，不知道该做什么，不知道该去哪里，不知道你的力量，怀疑你的能力和你的价值，这就是让你重新前进的召唤。因为你的生命必须前进。如果你停滞不前，它就会开始下沉。这并不好。</p>
<p>Feel your life moving and you will begin to sense a direction. You cannot sense a direction standing by the side of the road looking up and down and all around and wondering what you should do. You actually have to experience yourself moving and making progress.</p>
<p>感受你生命的不断前行，你就会开始感觉到方向。站在路边四处张望，不知道你该做什么，是无法感觉到方向的。你实际上必须体验你自己的不断前行和进步。</p>
<p>The practice in Steps to Knowledge will get your life moving in a real way, in a real direction. And your life will be moving in harmony with your true nature and your true purpose. As a result of taking these Steps, you will begin to experience your true nature and your true purpose, but they can only be experienced if you are moving in this direction, if you are actually moving in the direction you are meant to move in.</p>
<p>内识进阶中的实践将使你的生命以一种真正的方式，一种真正的方向前进。你的生命将与你的真实自然和真实目的和谐地前进。通过开展这些步骤，你将开始体验你的真实自然和真实目的，但只有当你朝着这个方向前进、当你真正朝着你应该前进的方向前进时，你才能体验到它们。</p>
<p>Society will want you to move in other directions. Perhaps the people with whom you are engaged will want you to move in other directions. Your past conditioning will try to move you in other directions. But you must move in the real direction.</p>
<p>社会将希望你朝其他的方向发展。也许与你交往的人会希望你朝着其他的方向发展。你过去的条件会试图将你推向其他的方向。但你必须朝着真正的方向前进。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you knows where you must go, who you must meet and what you must accomplish. It will never give up on you. It will never be defeated. As long as you are in this world, it will continue to exert its influence to provide this movement and this direction.</p>
<p>你内在的内识知道你必须去哪里，你必须遇见谁，你必须完成什么。它永远不会放弃你。它永远不会被打败。只要你在这个世界上，它就会继续发挥影响力，提供这个运动和这个方向。</p>
<p>And yet Knowledge within you knows that you cannot do it alone, that you need others to assist you and that you need a method of preparation. Because you cannot take the journey to Knowledge alone, you will need to share your deeper inclinations with others, but you must not simply share them with anyone. Here you must discern who can hear and who cannot hear. This is something that you can feel within yourself.</p>
<p>然而你内在的内识知道你无法独自做到，你需要他人协助你，你需要一种准备方法。因为你无法独自踏上内识之旅，所以你将需要与他人分享你的更深层次的倾向，但你绝不能简单地与任何人分享它们。在这里，你必须辨别谁能听见，谁不能听见。这是你能在你自己内在感受到的事情。</p>
<p>There are many people that you like and care for, perhaps, but that does not mean that all of them can really hear your deeper inclinations and can relate to them. In fact, if you share them with everyone, you will be shocked perhaps to see that many people are threatened by this or afraid of it or do not trust it or will even actively belittle or condemn what you are telling them.</p>
<p>也许你喜欢和关心的人有很多，但这并不意味着他们所有人都能真正听见你更深层次的倾向并与之产生共鸣。事实上，如果你和每个人分享它们，你也许会震惊地发现，很多人对此感到威胁或害怕它，或不信任它，甚至会主动贬低或谴责你告诉他们的内识。</p>
<p>In your personal life, you can have many friends, but in your deeper life, you need true allies and companions. This means that you must be able to share The Way of Knowledge with others—not to try to convince them, not to try to persuade them, but to see if this calling is being experienced by them.</p>
<p>在你的个人生命中，你可以有许多朋友，但在你更深层次的生命中，你需要真实的盟友和同伴。这意味着你必须能够与他人分享内识之路——不是试图说服他们，不是试图劝说他们，而是看看他们是否正在体验这个召唤。</p>
<p>As We have said, there is a great calling in the world—a calling to prepare, a calling to look over the horizon to see what is coming in your future, a calling to gain a new foundation and a new understanding. This calling is being sounded throughout the world, but there are many, many people who do not feel it and have not heard it.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，世界上有一个伟大的召唤——一个进行准备的召唤，一个看向地平线看清你们未来将会发生什么的召唤，一个获得一种新的基础和一种新的理解的召唤。这个召唤正在全世界响起，但有许多人没有感受到它、没有听到它。</p>
<p>You cannot persuade them. You will exert enormous energy and effort trying to do so. Only if they have heard it and have felt it and can identify it within themselves will they be able to hear what you are telling them. Here you are simply confirming something that they know.</p>
<p>你无法说服他们。你将耗费巨大的能量和努力来尝试说服他们。只有当他们听见、感受到并且能够在他们自己内心认同时，他们才能听懂你在说什么。在这里，你只是在确认他们所知道的事情。</p>
<p>Yet if you tell people who do not have this spark within themselves, they will fight you; they will disagree; they will become threatened; they will not understand what you are talking about; they will think that you are obsessed with something; they will become afraid. Even if their beliefs can accommodate the ideas that you might present to them, if they do not have this spark within themselves, there will not be a resonance between you.</p>
<p>然而，如果你告诉那些内心没有这种火花的人，他们会与你作对；他们会不同意；他们会感到威胁；他们不会理解你在说什么；他们会认为你痴迷于某事；他们会感到害怕。即使他们的信仰可以容纳你可能向他们提出的想法，如果他们内心没有这种火花，你们之间就不会产生共鸣。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must choose carefully. Do not try to win people over. It is only if a person has this spark within themselves. It is only if they have felt this calling, this uneasiness, this restlessness within themselves that you can reach them at another level.</p>
<p>因此，你必须谨慎选择。不要试图赢得他人的支持。只有当一个人内心有这种火花时。只有当他们自己内心感受到这种召唤、这种不安、这种烦躁时，你才能在另一个层面上接触到他们。</p>
<p>Then they will need support because they may not believe in what they are experiencing. They will need some assistance because they may not understand what they are experiencing. They need some sense of confirmation so that they can give greater credence and credibility to this deep but mysterious inner experience: this responsiveness to the world, this sense of calling, this sense that there is something greater for them to do and to be and to demonstrate.</p>
<p>然后他们将需要支持，因为他们可能不相信他们所经历的事情。他们将需要一些帮助，因为他们可能不理解他们所经历的事情。他们需要一些确认感，这样他们才能更加相信和可信地看待这种深刻而神秘的内在体验：这种对世界的回应，这种召唤感，这种感觉，即有更伟大的事情正等待着他们去做、去成为、去展示。</p>
<p>As We have said, We are not here to generate belief. We are here to activate Knowledge. Have this be your approach as you share The Way of Knowledge with others. You do not need people’s opinions. You do not want to have to deal with their ideas and beliefs. You want to find the spark. You want to find the spark within yourself. You want to find the spark in them.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，我们来这里不是为了产生信仰。我们来这里是为了激活内识。当你与他人分享内识之路时，请以此作为你的方法。你不需要人们的意见。你不想处理他们的想法和信仰。你想找到火花。你想找到你自己内心的火花。你想找到他们内心的火花。</p>
<p>Even as I say these words, even at this moment, perhaps there is someone you can think of who could really respond to this, with whom you could really share something very precious, very sacred and very rare. Perhaps you are thinking, “Oh yes, I know someone. I know someone who could really hear this.” Share your experience with them. Share this book with them.</p>
<p>就在我说这些话的时候，就在此刻，也许你能想到有人真的能对此做出回应，你可以和他分享一些非常珍贵、非常神圣、非常罕见的事情。也许你在想，“哦，是的，我知道一个人。我知道一个人真的能听到这些。”和他们分享你的经历。和他们分享这本书。</p>
<p>This book is a calling for people who have felt this spark. This calling and this book are for people who have a greater possibility and a greater destiny.</p>
<p>这本书是对那些感受到这种火花的人的召唤。这种召唤和这本书是为那些拥有更伟大可能性和更伟大天命的人准备的。</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone else is not ready, but there are many people in the world today who are ready. They will look in vain into their romantic relationships, into their hobbies, into their art, into all kinds of interests, but they are looking because they need this calling. It is vital for them. It is lifegiving. It is essential.</p>
<p>也许其他人还没有准备好，但当今世界上有许多人已经准备好了。他们会徒劳地寻找他们的恋爱关系、他们的爱好、他们的艺术、他们的各种兴趣，但他们在寻找，因为他们需要这种召唤。这对他们至关重要。它赋予生命。它是必要的。</p>
<p>You will see this spark in people. Look for it. Review your relationships and ask yourself, “Is this person ready to learn about the Greater Community and about The Way of Knowledge? Is this other person ready to learn about the Greater Community and about The Way of Knowledge?” If you ask this with a clear mind, more often than not you will be able to see clearly who is ready and who is not. It is a feeling. It is something you know.</p>
<p>你会在人们身上看到这种火花。去寻找它。回顾你的人际关系，问问你自己：“这个人准备好学习大社区和内识之路了吗？另一个人准备好学习大社区和内识之路了吗？”如果你用清晰的心灵去问这个问题，你往往能够清楚地看到谁准备好了，谁还没有准备好。这是一种感觉。这是你知道的事情。</p>
<p>While it is true sometimes people will surprise you, yet often you will have an inclination that someone has something mysterious going on in their life, and they are ready to learn more, and they need some assistance. Just like you are ready to learn more, and you need some assistance. This is how Knowledge is shared. This is how Knowledge is built within relationships.</p>
<p>虽然有时人们确实会让你感到惊讶，但你常常会有一种倾向，认为某人的生命中发生了一些神秘的事情，他们准备学习更多，他们需要一些帮助。就像你准备学习更多，你需要一些帮助一样。这就是内识共享的方式。这就是内识在关系中建立的方式。</p>
<p>Consider this: Knowledge within you is not trying to overtake you. It is not trying to win you over with praise or threats of destruction. It is not threatening you with eternity in Hell. It is not trying to control or manipulate you. Rather, it is a growing light within you, forever burning, forever calling, forever giving its beneficial influence.</p>
<p>请考虑这一点：你内心的内识不会试图控制你。它不会试图用赞美或毁灭的威胁来赢得你的心。它不会用地狱的永恒来威胁你。它不会试图控制或操纵你。相反，它是你内心不断增长的光，永远燃烧，永远召唤，永远发挥其有益的影响。</p>
<p>This is how the Creator works in the world. This is how Knowledge functions within the individual. And this is how you can become over time an emissary for Knowledge. And the calling will sound through you and with you. It will happen naturally. Knowledge will speak to this person but not to that person. And Knowledge will call out to these people but not to those people—because Knowledge knows who is ready.</p>
<p>这就是造物主在世界上工作的方式。这就是内识在个人内在运作的方式。这就是你如何随着时间的推移成为内识的使者。召唤将通过你、与你一起响起。它将自然发生。内识将对这个人讲话，但不对那个人讲话。内识将召唤这些人，但不召唤那些人——因为内识知道谁已经做好准备。</p>
<p>As you learn to become close to Knowledge, you will know who is ready and who is not. If someone is not ready, then bless them. Do not condemn them. It is okay. For earlier in your life, you were not ready either. You could not hear the message. You could not respond. You were too self-preoccupied. You were too governed by your ideas and beliefs. So there should be no condemnation in your approach.</p>
<p>当你学会接近内识时，你将知道谁准备好了，谁还没准备好。如果有人还没准备好，那么祝福他们。不要谴责他们。没有关系。因为在你生命的早期，你也没有准备好。你无法听到讯息。你无法回应。你太专注于自我。你太受你的想法和信仰所支配。因此你的方法中不应该有谴责。</p>
<p>Yet you will have a natural desire to share The Way of Knowledge with others because you need relationships of this type. You need relationships that are capable of expressing Knowledge and supporting Knowledge. This is vitally necessary for you, for you need a witness. You need the confirmation. You need to be known by at least one person.</p>
<p>然而，你会自然而然地渴望与他人分享内识之路，因为你需要这种类型的关系。你需要能够表达内识和支持内识的关系。这对你来说至关重要，因为你需要一个见证人。你需要确认。你需要被至少一个人知道。</p>
<p>If you are to play a great role in life, if you are to fulfill your purpose in being here, if you are to discover the greatness within yourself, then you must have this approach. You must take these chances. What do you have to risk?</p>
<p>如果你要在生命中扮演伟大角色，如果你要实现你存在的意义，如果你要发现你自己的伟大之处，那么你必须采取这种方法。你必须抓住这些机会。你有什么风险呢？</p>
<p>All people really have to risk is their idea of themselves. People are terrified to challenge their ideas of themselves because they think without their self-created ideas of themselves, they would be nothing. They would have no focus, no purpose and no meaning and that they would sort of go into a state of self-annihilation.</p>
<p>人们真正需要冒险的就是他们对他们自己的想法。人们害怕挑战他们对他们自己的想法，因为他们认为，如果没有他们自己创造的自我观念，他们就什么都不是。他们将没有重点、没有目的、没有意义，他们会陷入一种自我毁灭的状态。</p>
<p>What is really at risk? What are people really protecting? If you reduce it down to its essential elements, people are really protecting an idea of themselves—just an idea. You could say, “Oh, they are protecting their money. They’re trying to keep money and love in their life and that is why they acted dishonestly. That is why they compromised themselves.” But ultimately it is all an attempt to protect an idea about oneself.</p>
<p>真正处于危险中的是什么？人们真正在保护的是什么？如果你把它归结为基本要素，人们实际上是在保护他们自己的一个想法——仅仅是一个想法。你可能会说，“哦，他们在保护他们的钱。他们试图在生命中保留金钱和爱，这就是他们不诚实的原因。这就是他们妥协的原因。”但归根结底，这一切都是为了保护自己的一个想法。</p>
<p>Having fixed beliefs, being adamantly attached to one’s ideals and beliefs and assumptions—it is all to protect just an idea of yourself. So really nothing is at risk because an idea of yourself is really nothing. It is just a substitute for Knowledge. It is an attempt to be who you are without knowing who you are. It is an attempt to have purpose in life without knowing your purpose in life. It is an attempt to have meaning and value without really knowing your meaning and value. How can this succeed?</p>
<p>有固定的信念，固执己见，坚守自己的理想、信念和假设——这一切都是为了保护你自己的想法。所以实际上没有什么是危险的，因为你自己的想法实际上什么也不是。它只是内识的替代品。它试图成为你自己，却不知道你是谁。它试图在生命中拥有目的，却不知道你生命的目的。它试图在生命中有意义和有价值，却不知道你的意义和价值。这如何能成功呢？</p>
<p>Share The Way of Knowledge with others. But share it with those people who are feeling the spark. Maybe they will not accept your gift at first, but they will think about it. Perhaps their first response will not be welcoming, but they will be touched.</p>
<p>与他人分享内识之路。但要与那些感受到火花的人分享。也许他们一开始不会接受你的礼物，但他们会考虑。也许他们的第一反应不会是欢迎的，但他们会被触及。</p>
<p>Share this book with them, for this book is a calling. It is sounding the calling. It is resonating the great calling that is happening in the world. It is one of the few books in existence that can prepare you for the future. It is one of the few books in existence that will really recognize your meaning and your value and your purpose in life within the context of the world’s evolution. It is one of the few books in existence that can begin to teach you about the Greater Community and its imminent importance to you.</p>
<p>和他们分享这本书，因为这本书是一种召唤。它发出召唤。它与世界上正在发生的伟大召唤产生共鸣。它是现存的少数几本能够让你为未来做好准备的书籍之一。它是现存的少数几本能够在世界进化的背景下真正认识到你的意义、你的价值和你的生命目的的书籍之一。它是现存的少数几本能够开始教导你关于大社区及其对你迫切重要性的书籍之一。</p>
<p>Share this book with those who are ready to receive it. Let them struggle with the message. Let them find its importance and its value within themselves. Do not argue with them. Do not debate with them. Simply give them this book. Everyone must go through some struggle to overcome their ambivalence and to learn to discern where Knowledge really exists within them.</p>
<p>与那些准备好接收这本书的人分享。让他们为这个讯息而奋斗。让他们从他们自己内心找到它的重要性和价值。不要与他们争论。不要与他们辩论。只需把这本书交给他们。每个人都必须经历一些挣扎来克服他们的矛盾心理，并学会辨别内识真正存在于他们内心的地方。</p>
<p>This book is only about Knowledge. It is only about truth. It is only about being connected to reality in the world. If you find its ideas to be radical, it only tells you how far behind humanity is in understanding its condition and its need for preparation. If you think this book is far-fetched, then that only shows you how your social conditioning has retarded your understanding, your ability and your vision.</p>
<p>这本书只讲内识。它只讲真理。它只讲与世界现实的联接。如果你发现它的想法是激进的，它只会告诉你人类在理解其状况和准备需求方面落后了多少。如果你认为这本书牵强附会，那么这只会向你展示你的社会条件如何阻碍了你的理解、你的能力和你的视野。</p>
<p>This book is not far-fetched. This book is not radical. It is sound. It is true. It is absolutely fundamental. But because people in the world have not found this soundness, they have not found what is true, they have not found what is fundamental, then what is fundamental seems radical. It seems far out. But it is not.</p>
<p>这本书并不牵强附会。这本书并不激进。它是合理的。它是真实的。它是绝对根本的。但是因为世界上的人们还没有找到这种合理性，他们还没有找到什么是真实的，他们还没有找到什么是根本的，所以根本的东西看起来是激进的。它似乎很离谱。但事实并非如此。</p>
<p>Share this book with people. Let them struggle with the book. Do not have them struggle with you. This book is a calling. To respond to a calling, you must find what is real within yourself. You cannot simply engage with it at the level of ideas and beliefs. You must feel it deep within yourself.</p>
<p>与他人分享这本书。让他们为这本书而苦恼。不要让他们为你而苦恼。这本书是一种召唤。要响应召唤，你必须找到你自己内心的真实。你不能仅仅在想法和信仰的层面上与之互动。你必须在你自己的内心深处感受到它。</p>
<p>While We are here to present new ideas, Our fundamental aim is to activate Knowledge. In this, this book is an initiation into The Way of Knowledge. It is a confirmation of who you are, why you are here and what you most deeply know.</p>
<p>虽然我们来这里是为了提出新的想法，但我们的根本目的是激活内识。在这方面，这本书是内识之路的启蒙。它确认了你是谁、你为什么在这里以及你最深处的知道。</p>
<p>And yet it is a challenge because it challenges all of the ideas, all of the assumptions that disable people from having this fundamental and primary experience. It challenges the ambivalence; it challenges the pessimism; it challenges the obsessions that are endemic in human society.</p>
<p>然而，这也是一种挑战，因为它挑战所有的想法、所有的假设，这些想法、假设使人们无法获得这种基本的、主要的体验。它挑战的是矛盾心理，挑战的是悲观主义，挑战的是人类社会普遍存在的强迫症。</p>
<p>It only honors Knowledge, nothing else. It only asks for Knowledge, nothing else. It is a calling. Those who can hear, will hear. But they must hear more clearly; they must develop their hearing; they must find the strength to trust what is most deeply known within them.</p>
<p>它只尊重内识，别无其他。它只要求内识，别无其他。它是一种召唤。那些能听见的人会听到它。但他们必须听得更清晰；他们必须发展他们的听力；他们必须找到力量去信任他们内心最深处的知道。</p>
<p>It is time now to begin the preparation for the Greater Community. It is time now to begin the preparation in learning The Way of Knowledge. Yet how can this be done? Should you go to the university? Should you go to the therapist? Should you go to your best friend? Should you peruse the library and see what kind of books you can find?</p>
<p>现在是时候开始为大社区做准备了。现在是时候开始为学习内识之路做准备了。然而，这该怎么做呢？你应该去大学吗？你应该去看心理医生吗？你应该去找你最好的朋友吗？你应该去图书馆看看你能找到什么样的书吗？</p>
<p>Yes, you will find writings and teachings that validate the reality of Knowledge, but you will not find any books or teachings that will validate the reality of Knowledge within the context of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. That is because humanity is at a great turning point, and a turning point requires a New Revelation, a new Teaching and a new foundation.</p>
<p>是的，你会找到证实内识现实的著作和教导，但你不会找到任何书籍或教导，在世界迈向大社区的背景下证实内识现实。这是因为人类正处于一个伟大的转折点，而转折点需要一个新的启示、一个新的教导和一个新的基础。</p>
<p>The vast majority of what is available to you has been created in a state of isolation. There is no recognition of the Greater Community. There is no recognition of humanity’s future in the Greater Community. There is no recognition that the Greater Community, more than anything else, is what will determine what humanity must face and contend with.</p>
<p>你所能获得的绝大部分事物都是在孤立的状态下创造的。没有对大社区的认知。没有对人类在大社区中的未来的认知。没有认识到大社区比其他任何事情都更能决定人类必须面对和应对什么。</p>
<p>Read the predictions for the future in books everywhere, and you will find human beings postulating a future for human beings alone. There is no recognition that you are emerging into a larger arena of life. It is totally isolationist thinking. If there were no Greater Community, and if the Greater Community were not in the world, that would be adequate. But this is not the case.</p>
<p>阅读世界各地书籍中对未来的预测，你会发现人类假设的未来只属于人类。他们没有认识到你们正在进入一个更大的生命舞台。这是完全孤立主义的思维。如果没有大社区，如果大社区不存在于这个世界，它是足够了。但事实并非如此。</p>
<p>Therefore, these teachings, no matter how valuable they may be in their content and in their intention, are not adequate. Humanity is at a turning point. What was valuable yesterday, what worked yesterday now has to be reassessed. Something new has to be given to enable humanity to take the great steps ahead.</p>
<p>因此，这些教导无论内容和意图多么宝贵，都还不够。人类正处于转折点。昨天有价值的事情、昨天奏效的事情现在必须重新评估。必须给予一些新的事物，使人类能够向前迈出伟大的一步。</p>
<p>All religious traditions in the world need something new to give them this vantage point, to give them this power so they can continue to be viable and relevant. That is why The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is being presented into the world. It is not here to replace the religions of the world but to give them new life and to give them relevancy and purpose within the context of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community.</p>
<p>世界上所有的宗教传统都需要一些新的事物来赋予它们这种优势，赋予它们这种力量，使它们能够继续生存和有意义。这就是为什么大社区内识之路被呈现给世界。它的存在不是为了取代世界上的宗教，而是为了赋予它们新的生命，赋予它们在世界向大社区迈进的背景下的意义和目的。</p>
<p>This Teaching, which has never been available before in the world, is now being introduced. It is not being advertised over the television. It is not on billboards across the country. Instead, it is being presented through this book and books like it. It is being shared from person to person. It is being transmitted through meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>这个教导在世界上从未出现过，现在正在被介绍。它没有在电视上做广告。它不在全国各地的广告牌上。相反，它通过这本书和类似的书籍呈现。它正在人与人之间分享。它正在通过有意义的关系传播。</p>
<p>It is being given to empower humanity, to redirect humanity’s awareness and focus, to educate humanity about the Greater Community and to call upon the inherent strength of humanity so that human beings everywhere can come to find their meaning and their value and their purpose in life and can make a real contribution to the world in its current needs.</p>
<p>它是为了赋予人类权力，改变人类的觉知和焦点，教育人类了解大社区，并唤起人类固有的力量，这样世界各地的人就能找到他们生命的意义、价值和目的，并能为世界当前的需求做出一种真正的贡献。</p>
<p>You are very fortunate to have this book. You are very fortunate to be able to hear these ideas. Even if you have difficulty understanding them or relating to them, you are a person of great fortune to be able to receive them.</p>
<p>你很幸运能拥有这本书。你很幸运能听到这些想法。即使你很难理解或与它们产生共鸣，你也很幸运能接收到它们。</p>
<p>You are one of the first to hear the great Message. You are one of the first to have the opportunity to begin a Greater Community education. You are one of the first to have the privilege to be able to learn what spirituality means in the Greater Community and how it will clarify all of your questions about spirituality here on Earth.</p>
<p>你是第一批听到伟大讯息的人之一。你是第一批有机会开始接受大社区教育的人之一。你是第一批有幸能够学习精神性在大社区中的意义以及它将如何澄清你关于地球上精神性的所有疑问的人之一。</p>
<p>It is time to begin the preparation. That is the only way that you will understand fully what is being presented here. And that is the only way that you will be able to experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>是时候开始准备了。这是你完全理解这里所介绍内容的唯一方法。这也是你能够亲身体验的唯一方法。</p>
<p>I know My words are not enough. I know that the perspective I am sharing is not quite enough. People must have this experience themselves—not just a fleeting experience here and there, but a clear experience.</p>
<p>我知道我的文字是不够的。我知道我分享的感知是不够的。人们必须自己拥有这种体验——不只是偶尔的短暂体验，而是一种清晰的体验。</p>
<p>It must be very crystal clear to them that the world is emerging into the Greater Community and that people must find the way to Knowledge in order to prepare. This cannot simply be a hope or an expectation, an ideal or a belief. It must be a certainty based upon a real experience. How will you gain this real experience? By taking the Steps to Knowledge. By learning a Greater Community Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>他们必须非常清楚地认识到，世界正在步入大社区，人们必须找到内识之路，以便做好准备。这不能只是一种希望或期望，一种理想或一种信仰。它必须是基于一种真实体验的确定性。你将如何获得这种真实体验？通过开展内识的进阶。通过学习大社区的内识之路。</p>
<p>As We have said, the answer to great questions is a means of preparation. When you ask, “Who am I? Why am I here? What must I accomplish? Who must I meet?” these are great questions. Would a few words suffice to answer them? If you think that words alone would be an answer to these questions, then you do not know what you are asking for. You have no idea what you are requesting.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，回答伟大问题是一种准备方式。当你问：“我是谁？我为什么在这里？我必须完成什么？我必须遇见谁？”这些都是伟大的问题。几句话就足以回答它们吗？如果你认为仅凭语言就能回答这些问题，那么你就不知道你在要求什么。你不知道你在请求什么。</p>
<p>The only way to find the answer is to be given a means of preparation that can take you up the mountain of life, that can provide the steps, that can give you the perspective that you need, that can enable you to refocus your mind and your energies in a true direction.</p>
<p>找到答案的唯一方法就是为你提供一种准备方式，它可以带你攀登生命的高山，它可以提供步骤，它可以给你所需要的视角，它可以使你将你的心灵和能量重新集中在一个真实的方向上。</p>
<p>If you ask Me, “How will I know what I need to know?” I say, “ I will take you up the mountain where you can see for yourself.” You may say, “Well, just give me the answer!” and I say, “There is no answer until you see for yourself, and the only way you can see for yourself is to reach that vantage point where you can look above the trees out over the lay of the land and gain a real perspective about where you are and what is happening.”</p>
<p>如果你问我：“我如何才能知道我需要知道的事情？”我会说：“我会带你上山，在那里你可以亲眼看到。”你可能会说：“好吧，只要告诉我答案就行了！”我会说：“除非你亲眼看到，否则不会有答案，而你亲眼看到的唯一方法就是到达那个观测点，在那里你可以俯瞰树木，俯瞰地势，真正知道你所在的位置和正在发生的事情。”</p>
<p>You must get there. There is no other way. Having beliefs, having ideals, having grand visions of life, having high experiences—that is not it. That will never work. Many people dedicate themselves to having these things, thinking that that will be adequate, but they never have the foundation inside, and they never get far enough up the mountain to see what is happening on the outside.</p>
<p>你必须到达那里。别无他法。有信仰、有理想、有宏大的人生愿景、有高尚的经历——这些都不是办法。这些永远行不通。许多人致力于拥有这些东西，认为这就足够了，但他们的内心从未有过基础，他们也从未爬到足够高的山峰，去看到外面正在发生了事情。</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer to your need to know, your need to realize who you are, why you are here, what you must accomplish and who you must meet can only be answered by giving you a preparation that will enable you to find out for yourself.</p>
<p>因此，你需要知道，你需要认识你是谁，你为什么在这里，你必须完成什么以及你必须遇见谁，这些答案只能通过给你一种准备来回答，这种准备将使你自己能够发现答案。</p>
<p>Here you will find out without heroes, without gurus, without falling down on your knees to worship some individual. Here you must find the way, but you will not journey alone, for you will need others to help you.</p>
<p>在这里，你无需英雄，无需大师，无需跪下崇拜某个人，你就能找到出路。在这里，你必须找到出路，但你不会孤身一人，因为你需要他人的帮助。</p>
<p>And you will need one of the few people in the world who can instruct you in The Way of Knowledge, in a Greater Community Way of Knowledge. They are there and you will find them when you really need them. But in order to find them and in order to recognize them, you must prepare.</p>
<p>你将需要世界上少数几个能够指导你内识之路、大社区内识之路的人。他们就在那里，当你真正需要他们的时候，你就会找到他们。但是，为了找到他们、为了认出他们，你必须做好准备。</p>
<p>Many people want the great results of spiritual awakening, but they are unwilling to take the journey. They simply want the answers. They think the answers can be given in words or in concepts or can be revealed in having high and happy experiences. They will not make the journey, and so they will not find out. And they will never develop the skill and the power and the ability to live such an awakened life because they will not take the journey.</p>
<p>许多人想要获得精神觉醒的伟大成果，但他们不愿意踏上旅程。他们只是想要答案。他们认为答案可以用文字或概念来给出，或者可以通过拥有高尚而快乐的体验来揭示。他们不会踏上旅程，所以他们不会找到答案。他们永远不会发展出过上这种醒来生命的技能、力量和能力，因为他们不会踏上旅程。</p>
<p>Life is a journey. It is trying to get from one place to another. Knowledge knows where you need to get to. It knows what you need to recognize. It knows the skill and ability you need to cultivate along the way.</p>
<p>生命是一场旅程。它试图从一个地方到达另一个地方。内识知道你需要去哪里。它知道你需要认识什么。它知道你在旅途中需要培养的技能和能力。</p>
<p>It is time to prepare. The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is the only Teaching in the world that can prepare you for the Greater Community. It is the only Teaching in the world that can present to you what Knowledge and Wisdom really mean within a larger arena of intelligent life. It is the only Teaching in the world that can activate your Knowledge and give it full expression within the context of the world’s evolution.</p>
<p>是时候进行准备了。大社区的内识之路是世界上唯一能够让你为大社区做好准备的教导。它是世界上唯一能够向你展示内识和智慧在更广阔的智能生命领域中真正意味着什么的教导。它是世界上唯一能够激活你的内识并在世界进化的背景下充分表达它的教导。</p>
<p>It is a New Revelation. It is a new gift to humanity. It is the gift humanity now needs in order to emerge out of its isolation and face the realities, the difficulties and the opportunities that await it in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>它是一个新的启示。它是给人类的一份新的礼物。这是人类现在需要的礼物，以便走出孤立，面对大社区里正等待它的现实、困难和机会。</p>
<p>The Creator would not leave you alone or unprepared for the Greater Community. The Creator would not leave you without a means for discovering the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>造物主不会让你孤身一人或毫无准备地进入大社区。造物主不会让你没有办法去发现将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>Receive this gift. Hear this calling. Find your deepest response. Go beyond your thinking and your ideas. Go beyond your preoccupations and attachments.</p>
<p>接受这份礼物。聆听这个召唤。找到你最深处的回应。超越你的思维和想法。超越你的专注和执着。</p>
<p>There is something great living within you. It is needed within the world now. It is being called for at this moment. It is a calling to awaken.</p>
<p>你的内心深处蕴藏着一种伟大的内识。现在这个世界需要它。此刻，它正在被召唤。它是一种醒来的召唤。</p>
