<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 11, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年9月11日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many people in the world today who have no one who can truly recognize them. Beyond their position in a family or a culture, beyond their work as an adult, there is no one in the world who really knows who they are or has a deeper feeling for their life and their destiny. Though people are in relationship for many different reasons—to escape loneliness, to build a family, for social position, for wealth, for power, for companionship—even here this deeper recognition is rare.</p>
<p>当今世界上有许多人没有人能够真正认识他们。除了他们在家庭或文化中的位置，除了他们作为成年人的工作，世界上没有人真正知道他们是谁，也没有人对他们的生命和他们的天命有一种更深层次的感受。尽管人们建立关系的原因各不相同——为了逃避孤独、建立家庭、为了社会地位、为了财富、为了权力、为了陪伴——但即使在这里，这种更深层次的认知也是罕见的。</p>
<p>This is really tragic because to be known by someone is to have your deeper nature recognized and strengthened. People are not living according to their deeper nature. They are living according to their adaptation to their culture, to their family, perhaps to a religion. This is their social identity, their social self, but there is a deeper reality within them.</p>
<p>这真的是悲剧，因为被人知道意味着你更深层次的自然被认出和强化。人们并没有按照他们更深层次的自然生活。他们是在适应他们的文化、他们的家庭，或许是他们的宗教进行生活。这就是他们的社会身份，他们的社会自我，但在他们的内心深处还有一种更深层次的现实。</p>
<p>This deeper reality was created by God. It does not have a nametag. It does not have a social function. It is not simply based upon one’s role in a family or a culture. It is not based necessarily on one’s work or vocation.</p>
<p>这种更深层次的现实是由上帝创造的。它没有名字标签。它没有社会功能。它不仅仅基于一个人在家庭或文化中的角色。它不必基于一个人的工作或职业。</p>
<p>To go through life unrecognized is really to be alone. Even if you are a very social person and have a large network of friends, even if you have many engagements with other people, even if you are physically living in a crowded city or a crowded apartment, if you are unrecognized, you are alone. And this loneliness is haunting. It goes with you everywhere. It is the tragedy of Separation.</p>
<p>在不被认出的情况下度过生命，其实就是孤独。即使你是一个非常善于社交的人，拥有庞大的朋友圈，即使你与其他人有许多约定，即使你生活在一个拥挤的城市或拥挤的公寓里，如果你不被人认出，你就是孤独的。而这种孤独感是挥之不去的。它无处不在。这就是分离的悲剧。</p>
<p>Wealthy people try to compensate for this by constant stimulation, by the constant acquisition of things they do not need and by trying to gain recognition from others for whatever beauty or wealth or charm they might possess. But they too are alone. Take away their stimulation, take away their possessions, take away all of their social posturing and you have a lonely, isolated person.</p>
<p>富人试图通过不断的刺激、不断获取他们不需要的事物以及试图通过他们可能拥有的任何美貌、财富或魅力来获得他人的认可来弥补这一点。但他们也是孤独的。剥夺他们的刺激、剥夺他们的财产、剥夺他们所有的社会姿态，你就会看到一个孤独、孤立的人。</p>
<p>This is the tragedy of Separation. It is the result and demonstration that people are not living according to their deeper nature. They are not living deeper within their own mind and consciousness. They are living at the surface.</p>
<p>这是分离的悲剧。这是人们没有按照他们更深层次的自然生活的结果和证明。他们没有生活在他们自己更深层次的心灵和意识中。他们生活在表面。</p>
<p>And like being at the surface of the ocean, they are blown around by the winds of the world, their life is out of control, and they are being swept away by other forces beyond themselves. They are going through life as a kind of duty or resignation—unaware of where they are, who they are and where they really need to go in life.</p>
<p>就像在海面上一样，他们被世界的风吹得四处飘摇，他们的生命失去了控制，他们被他们自己之外的其他力量卷走。他们把生命当成一种责任或一种顺从——没有察觉到他们在哪里，他们是谁，他们真正需要去哪里。</p>
<p>This loneliness and this isolation is a source of great suffering and great anxiety. For even if you had every social advantage, there is really no one there for you. People may depend upon you and your productivity, your wealth or your social standing. People may need you for what your labor can produce. But there is really no one there for you. At a very deep level this creates a tremendous emptiness and isolation.</p>
<p>这种孤独和孤立是巨大痛苦和焦虑的根源。因为即使你拥有一切社会优势，实际上也没有人支持你。人们可能依赖你和你的生产力、你的财富或你的社会地位。人们可能需要你的劳动成果。但实际上没有人支持你。从更深层面上讲，这造成了极大的空虚和孤立。</p>
<p>If you cannot know others, then people are just parts of a social, functioning society—playing roles, distant from you. Their needs are not your needs. You may have no feeling for them at all. They are just people moving about with their own burdens, their own isolation. But the truth is they are facing the same isolation as you—alone, unknown and unable to know others.</p>
<p>如果你无法知道他人，那么人们就只是社会运转的一部分——扮演着与你相距甚远的角色。他们的需求不是你的需求。你可能对他们毫无感觉。他们只是带着他们自己的负担、他们自己的孤独四处走动的人。但真理是，他们和你一样面临孤立——独自一人、不为人知、无法知道他人。</p>
<p>Your condition places you in the same situation. The need is the same—the need for recognition, the need to resonate with someone at a deeper level, the need to have someone really there for you, not because you are trying to be charming or handsome or beautiful, but they are there for you.</p>
<p>你的情况也是如此。需求是一样的——需要被认出，需要在更深层次的层面上与他人产生共鸣，需要有人真正地陪伴你，不是因为你试图变得迷人、英俊或美丽，而是他们真的陪伴着你。</p>
<p>This is such a marvelous thing when it can happen because at the deepest level, love is about devotion. You may love many things about a person—their appearance, their circumstances, their charm, their beauty, their intelligence—but to be devoted comes from a greater recognition. To be devoted to another, not because of their assets but because of who they are, is an incredibly powerful antidote to suffering.</p>
<p>当这种情况发生时，这是一件非常奇妙的事情，因为在最深的层面上，爱是一种奉献。你可能爱一个人的许多方面——他们的外表、他们的处境、他们的魅力、他们的美貌、他们的智慧——但奉献来自一种更伟大的认知。对另一个人的奉献，不是因为他们的财富，而是因为他们是谁，是治疗痛苦的极其有效的良药。</p>
<p>When that devotion is shared, you have a relationship that has a deeper connection and a deeper destiny. Its power and its strength will compensate for whatever dissonance might occur at the level of your personalities, or your tastes or your preferences. This relationship will shine like a beacon in a dark land. It is a sign of hope for people who are struggling with hopelessness. It is a demonstration of recognition amongst those who are not recognized.</p>
<p>当你分享这份奉献时，你们的关系就会更加紧密，天命也会更加深远。它的力量和它的强度将弥补你们个性、品味或偏好方面可能出现的任何不和谐。这种关系将像黑暗中的灯塔一样闪耀。它是那些在绝望中挣扎的人们的希望之光。它是那些未被认出的人获得认识的表现。</p>
<p>This recognition occurs because you are functioning at a deeper level of Knowledge. This Knowledge that God has created— this deeper Intelligence, this deeper Self that is truly who you are—represents your greater nature and your real purpose for coming into the world. When another can recognize this and unite with this, then you have a relationship that represents a higher purpose in life.</p>
<p>这种认知的产生是因为你在更深层次的内识中运作。上帝创造了这个内识——这种更深层次的智能，这种真正属于你的更深层次的自我——代表着你的更伟大自然和你来到这个世界的真正目的。当另一个人能够认识到这一点并与之结合时，你们在生命中就拥有了一段代表更高宗旨的关系。</p>
<p>When you are known at this level, it enables you to know yourself, but it is really hard to know yourself at this deeper level if no one else is recognizing you. Only through very determined spiritual practice could you gain this recognition without the recognition of others. But even here you could lose this awareness of yourself if over time no one else was able to recognize you, to truly recognize you.</p>
<p>当你在这个层面上被人知道时，你就能知道你自己，但如果没有人知道你，那么在这个更深层次的层面上认识你自己实际上是困难的。只有通过非常坚定的精神实践，你才能在不被他人认知的情况下获得这种认识。但即使在这里，如果随着时间的推移没有人能够认识你、真正认识你，你也可能会失去对你自己的这种觉知。</p>
<p>This recognition leads to devotion. For if two or more people share a greater destiny, and they can recognize the reality of this destiny and experience the deeper resonance this creates in their experience, then you have a powerful relationship between two people or between many people.</p>
<p>这种认知导致奉献。因为如果两个或更多的人共享一个更伟大的天命，并且他们能够认出这个天命的现实，并体验到这在他们的经历中产生的更深层次的共鸣，那么你就拥有了一种两个人之间或许多人之间的强大关系。</p>
<p>Real spiritual community must be based upon this if it is to be strong and enduring and to have real depth and meaning. A real marriage must have all of these qualities as well, along with a greater compatibility, even at the personal level. That is why relationships of this kind seem to be rare in the world, for while the world is in many places very crowded with people, there is actually very little recognition that is occurring.</p>
<p>真正的精神社区必须以此为基础，才能强大而持久，并具有真正的深度和意义。真正的婚姻也必须具备所有这些品质，以及更伟大的兼容性，即使在个人层面也是如此。正因为如此，这种关系在世界上似乎很少见，因为虽然世界上许多地方都人满为患，但实际上很少有人能认知到这一点。</p>
<p>In the study of Steps to Knowledge, you learn to build a deeper connection to Knowledge within yourself, your deeper nature. And as you begin to experience this deeper nature, perhaps incrementally at first, you begin to look for deeper qualities in other people. As you progress, you are no longer so impressed by beauty, wealth and charm. You are looking for something deeper in other people, and this is the result of looking for something deeper within yourself. As your experience of your deeper nature grows, as you have a greater sense that there is a deeper current in your life, then you will want to build your relationships based upon this deeper current.</p>
<p>在内识进阶的研究中，你学会在你内心建立与内识、你更深层次的自然一种更深层次的联接。当你开始体验这种更深层次的自然时，也许一开始是逐渐的，你开始在其他人身上寻找更深层次的品质。随着你的进步，你不再对美貌、财富和魅力印象深刻。你在其他人身上寻找一种更深层次的内识，这是在你内心寻找一种更深层次内识的结果。随着你对你更深层次的自然体验不断增长，随着你更强烈地感受到你的生命中有一股更深层次的潮流，那么你将想要基于这种更深层次的潮流来构建你的关系。</p>
<p>Here you will not seek stimulation as much as you will a deeper resonance with other people. You will value honesty; you will value sincerity; you will value commitment over all other forms of stimulation. Instead of just trying to have fun with someone, you want to really feel a connection, and you look for this connection in other people. Though you will not have this deeper resonance with everyone, certain people will stand out. Among them there will be a few with whom you are destined to be united for a greater purpose, a greater work in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，你将不再寻求刺激，而是寻求与他人的一种更深层次的共鸣。你将珍视诚实；你将珍视真诚；你将珍视承诺，胜过所有其他形式的刺激。你不只是试图与某人寻欢作乐，而是想要真正感受到一种联结，你在其他人身上寻找这种联结。尽管你不会与每个人都产生这种更深层次的共鸣，但某些人会脱颖而出。在他们之中，你将注定与他们联合，为了世界上一个更伟大的目的、一个更伟大的工作。</p>
<p>You will look for this. And your mind will become ever more free of being seduced by beauty, wealth or charm. You may encounter the most beautiful person you have ever seen, and your mind may be impressed, but deeper down there is no response. Deeper down there is no recognition. Therefore, this person’s beauty accounts for nothing.</p>
<p>你会寻找这个。你的心灵会越来越不受美貌、财富或魅力的诱惑。你可能会遇到你见过的最美丽的人，你的心灵可能会留下深刻的印象，但内心深处却没有回应。内心深处没有认可。因此，这个人的美貌没有意义。</p>
<p>You are looking now for the people who represent and who will support your greater purpose and destiny in the world. Their outward appearance is not important now because you are looking for something deeper. And you are looking for this within yourself.</p>
<p>你现在正在寻找那些代表并支持你在世界上的更伟大目的和天命的人。他们的外表现在并不重要，因为你在寻找一种更深层次的内识。你在你自己的内心寻找它。</p>
<p>Now you just do not view yourself as an array of personality characteristics. You do not think of yourself as a mass of desires and fears. You do not think of yourself at the level of personality or even at the level of your physical existence, for you are looking down a deeper well now. What is at the bottom of that well is a great Presence, and you want to feel that Presence within yourself, and you want to share that Presence with other people.</p>
<p>现在你不再把你自己看作是一系列的人格特征。你不再把你自己看作是欲望和恐惧的集合。你不再把你自己看成是一个人格，甚至不再把你自己看成是一个物质层面的存在，因为你现在正在看向更深的井。这口井的底部是伟大的存在，你想在你自己内心感受到这种存在，你想与其他人分享这种存在。</p>
<p>Now your whole criteria for being with other people is shifting. Instead of looking for pleasure or stimulation, instead of trying to run away from being lonely or isolated, you are now looking for a deeper resonance. Here you are going beneath the surface, and you are looking for relationships of depth.</p>
<p>现在，你与他人相处的整个标准都在转变。你不再寻求快乐或刺激，不再试图逃避孤独或孤立，而是寻求一种更深层次的共鸣。在这里，你正在深入表层，寻找有深度的关系。</p>
<p>This is what really creates the opportunity for a deeper recognition to occur. Instead of just having recognition be some chance occurrence in the process of life, you are now creating the motive, the incentive and the opportunity for this recognition to occur. It is evident that people can go through their entire lives without ever having a deeper experience of recognition with others. In fact, this is immensely common. So do not just trust luck or chance. Do not think that this is just going to happen for you without you really exerting yourself.</p>
<p>这才是真正为一种更深层次的认知创造机会。领悟不再只是生命过程中偶然发生的事件，而是你正在为这种认知创造动机、激励和机会。显然，人们可能终其一生都没有与他人有过更深层次的认知体验。事实上，这种情况非常普遍。所以不要只信任运气或机会。不要认为你不需要付出真正的努力，这种事情就会自然而然地发生在你身上。</p>
<p>To have the opportunity to be known by others, you must build the connection to Knowledge so you can be known to yourself. Now you are really creating a change within yourself and even within the world. Now you are creating the opportunity for people to have an experience of recognition with you. Instead of sitting idly by and hoping and wishing for something to happen, you are creating the environment within yourself and around yourself where recognition is inevitable.</p>
<p>为了有机会被他人知道，你必须建立与内识的联接，这样你才能被你自己知道。现在你实际正在你自己的内在甚至在世界内部创造一种改变。现在你正在为人们创造与你一起获得认知体验的机会。你不是无所事事地坐在那里，希望和期盼某事发生，而是在你自己内在和周围创造一种环境，在这里认知是不可避免的。</p>
<p>That is why when people are doing something really important in life, other people will join them. They will join them not because this person is overwhelmingly charming or beautiful or has external attributes that are so attractive. They are being joined because they are doing something meaningful. And this meaningful activity creates recognition at a deeper level.</p>
<p>这就是为什么当人们在生命中做一些真正重要的事情时，其他人会加入他们。他们之所以加入他们，并不是因为这个人魅力非凡、美丽动人，或者拥有如此吸引人的外在特质。他们之所以被加入，是因为他们正在做一些有意义的事情。而这种有意义的活动会在更深层次的层面上产生认知。</p>
<p>This recognition experience requires that you not be judgmental or condemning of others, for that obstructs the whole process of discerning a person’s deeper nature. You may condemn people for their appearance, for their behavior, for their station in life. You may condemn them for their religion or their ethnicity. You may judge them for their personality or their self-expression and so on. But when you do this, you are preventing yourself from discerning their deeper nature.</p>
<p>这种认知体验要求你不要评判或谴责他人，因为这会阻碍你辨别一个人更深层次自然的整个过程。你可能会因为他人的外表、行为和地位而谴责他们。你可能会因为他们的宗教或种族而谴责他们。你可能会因为他们的个性或自我表达等而评判他们。但当你这样做时，你就阻碍了你自己辨别他们更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>That is why it is important to look at other people from more of a place of neutrality. It is easy to judge people. Everyone is fallible. People annoy you with their behavior, with their attitudes, with their speech, with their appearance. But when you are neutral and looking at them, you have a chance to see beyond the surface. You have a chance for a deeper experience of recognition.</p>
<p>这就是为什么从更中立的角度看待他人很重要。评判他人很容易。每个人都会犯错。人们的行为、态度、言语和外表都会让你感到厌烦。但当你以中立的态度看待他们时，你就有机会看透表面。你就有机会获得更深层次认知的体验。</p>
<p>You yourself know what it is like to live at the surface. You have been living there for years, and now you are trying and focusing on taking your awareness to a deeper level. So do not be so ready to judge. You know how easy it is to live at the surface. You know the social pressures and the economic pressures and the sense of isolation and desperation within people that lead them to behave so foolishly and recklessly.</p>
<p>你自己知道生活在表面是什么感觉。你已经在这里生活了许多年，现在你正努力并专注于将你的觉知提升到更深层次的层面。所以不要那么急于评判。你知道生活在表面是多么容易。你知道社会压力、经济压力以及人们内心的孤立感和绝望感导致他们如此愚蠢和鲁莽地行事。</p>
<p>To see another, you must become neutral. Neutral means you are not trying to love them; you are not trying to judge them; you are not trying to put them into a category; you are not trying to evaluate them according to their outward appearances. You are just neutral. You are just looking and listening. Without trying to make anything happen, you are just being present.</p>
<p>要看到他人，你必须保持中立。中立意味着你不会试图爱他们；你不会试图评判他们；你不会试图将他们归类；你不会试图根据他们的外表来评价他们。你只是保持中立。你只是在看和听。你不会试图让任何事情发生，你只是在场。</p>
<p>It is within this state of being present that you are able to learn more about the other person. You have a chance here to discern the deeper current of their life, which they are probably completely unaware of. Once you have this recognition, they also may have a recognition with you because they will feel and recognize that you are being with them in a very special way.</p>
<p>正是在这种存在状态下，你才能更多地了解对方。你有机会在这里辨别他们生命中更深层次的潮流，而他们可能对此一无所知。一旦你有了这种认知，他们也可能对你产生认知，因为他们会感觉到并认识到你以一种非常特殊的方式与他们同在。</p>
<p>Underneath everyone’s desperate pursuits, addictions, goals and fears is the desire to be known and recognized. People are angry. They are judgmental. They are even violent because they are not being recognized, and they have not found a way to gain a deeper recognition of themselves.</p>
<p>每个人的迫切追求、沉迷、目标和恐惧背后，都隐藏着渴望被知道和认识的欲望。人们会感到愤怒。他们会评判他人。他们甚至会使用暴力，因为他们没有被认识，他们还没有找到一种方式来获得对他们自己更深层次的认知。</p>
<p>When this recognition can take place, it is immensely healing and life affirming. Even if it only occurs for a moment, even if you only have a moment of true recognition with another, it can be profound in affecting them and in affecting you.</p>
<p>当这种认知发生时，它具有极大的治愈作用和生命力。即使它只发生一瞬间，即使你只有一瞬间与他人真正的认识，它也会对他们和你产生深远的影响。</p>
<p>There is always this emphasis on relationships and getting along with people and expressing your feelings and being honest and working out problems. But unless there is this deeper recognition, it is all happening at the surface.</p>
<p>人们总是强调人际关系、与人相处、表达感受、诚实和解决问题。但除非有这种更深层次的认知，否则这一切都只是浮于表面。</p>
<p>This recognition does not mean that you are going to marry this person or that they are going to be with you for the rest of your life. It just means that you are having a deeper experience. Only if this experience continued over time and if you had a sufficient level of compatibility with each other and were able to participate with each other in a meaningful way could a greater relationship come out of this.</p>
<p>这种认知并不意味着你会和这个人结婚，也不意味着他们会和你共度余生。它只是意味着你正在经历一种更深层次的体验。只有当这种体验持续一段时间，并且你们彼此之间具有足够的兼容性，并且能够以有意义的方式参与其中时，一段更伟大的关系才会由此产生。</p>
<p>But recognition is not relationship yet. A spark is not a fire. An understanding is not a reality. But for a true relationship to be built—whether it be in a marriage or in a spiritual community or in a network where people are working together for an important purpose or goal—this recognition is very important.</p>
<p>但认知还不等于关系。火花不是火。理解不是现实。但要建立真实的关系——无论是在婚姻中、在精神社区中，还是在人们为重要目的或目标共同努力的网络中——这种认知是非常重要的。</p>
<p>Here people become more devoted to one another, more caring for one another. They share a greater destiny together. Their appreciation for themselves far surpasses whatever outward appearances or charms they might have. Here you are loving the person for who they are, not for what they can do, how they appear or the way they behave, but really for a deeper nature and quality within them.</p>
<p>在这里，人们变得更加忠诚于彼此，更加关心彼此。他们共同分享着更伟大的天命。他们对他们自己的欣赏远远超越了他们可能拥有的任何外表或魅力。在这里，你爱的是这个人本身，而不是他们能做什么、他们如何出现或他们如何行为，而是因为他们内在的更深层次的自然和品质。</p>
<p>This is what everyone wants in relationship. And yet this is what is so very rare. That is why taking the Steps to Knowledge is revolutionary because here you are breaking the ice; you are breaking free of life on the surface; and you are focusing on the deeper reality of Knowledge within yourself—a deeper Intelligence beyond the realm and the scope of the intellect.</p>
<p>这是每个人在关系中都想要的。然而，这却非常罕见。正因为如此，开展内识进阶是革命性的，因为在这里，你正在打破坚冰；你正在摆脱表面的生命；你正在专注于你内在内识的更深层次的现实——一种超越智力领域和范围的更深层次的智能。</p>
<p>You are beginning here to have a real recognition within yourself that you are not simply a social functionary in life, you are not simply a nametag, you are not simply a description of your personality, but there is really a greater reality within you.</p>
<p>你在这里开始真正认知到你自己不仅仅是生命中的一个社会职能人员，你不仅仅是一个名字标签，你不仅仅是你人格的一个描述，你内心还真正有一个更伟大的现实。</p>
<p>You are beginning to have a recognition experience of this as a result of taking the Steps to Knowledge. Now you are beginning to have this experience with other people. Here the deeper need for recognition, the deeper need for purpose and meaning, has an opportunity to become fulfilled.</p>
<p>作为内识进阶的结果，你开始对此有了认知体验。现在你开始与其他人一起拥有这种体验。在这里，对认知的更深层次的需求、对目的和意义的更深层次的需求有机会得到满足。</p>
<p>What do people really need? They need to recognize their deeper nature. They need to be recognized by others. They need devotion in their life—to be devoted to others and to have people devoted to them. They need to fulfill their greater purpose and destiny in the world, a greater purpose that God has placed within them—a contribution to life, a unique set of gifts to be given in concert with certain other people.</p>
<p>人们真正需要什么？他们需要认知他们更深层次的自然。他们需要被他人认知。他们需要在他们的生命中奉献——奉献给他人并让人们奉献给他们。他们需要实现他们在世界上的更伟大目的和天命，上帝赋予他们内在的一个更伟大宗旨——对生命的一种贡献，一套与某些其他人共同给予的独特礼物。</p>
<p>Beyond having enough food and shelter and clothing and outward security, this represents the deeper need in people everywhere, from any country or culture or circumstance. When there is true recognition, real devotion can arise. And real devotion is the greatest demonstration of love.</p>
<p>除了拥有足够的食物、住所、衣服和外在的安全之外，这代表了世界各地人民的一种更深层次的需求，无论他们来自哪个国家、文化或环境。当人们真正认知到这一点时，就会产生真正的奉献。真正的奉献是爱的最大体现。</p>
<p>Here devotion is not attachment. It is not based upon dependence or need. It is based upon a deeper resonance with another person and a sense of shared destiny with another person. You still have to work out the difficulties of relationship—the daily issues that might arise, the disagreements over certain things—but fundamentally you are connected at a deeper level.</p>
<p>在这里，奉献不是依恋。它不是基于依赖或需求。它基于与他人更深层次的共鸣和与他人共享天命的感觉。你仍然必须解决关系中的困难——可能出现的日常问题、对某些事情的分歧——但从根本上说，你们在更深层次的层面上是相连的。</p>
<p>This has the power to override differences of view or opinion. This is really the glue that holds people together in a real way. It is so very different from dependency or attachment. It is coming from a place of strength, not from weakness within yourself. It is really a reward, one of life’s greatest rewards. It is what everyone is looking for.</p>
<p>这有能力克服观点或意见的差异。这实际上是将人们真正团结在一起的粘合剂。这与依赖或依恋截然不同。它来自力量，而不是来自你内心的弱点。它实际上是一种回报，是生命中最伟大的回报之一。这是每个人都在寻找的。</p>
<p>Here the tragedies of the rich become apparent, for though they may appear to have everything, though they may appear even to have the luxury of free time, though they can own anything and go anywhere and have so much social power, if they are unrecognized and unknown, they are desolate. And despite their wealth or privilege, depression will overtake them. They will find that their life is empty and without real meaning or purpose.</p>
<p>富人的悲剧就此显现出来，因为尽管他们似乎拥有一切，尽管他们似乎甚至拥有自由时间的奢侈，尽管他们可以拥有任何东西、去任何地方并拥有如此巨大的社会权力，但如果他们不被认知和不为人知，他们就会孤独。尽管他们富有或享有特权，但抑郁会降临到他们头上。他们会发现他们的生命是空虚的，没有真正的意义或目的。</p>
<p>The tragedy of the poor is certainly more apparent due to their circumstances and to the difficulty of their environment. Yet they suffer from the same isolation, from the same dreadful separation.</p>
<p>穷人的悲剧当然因他们的境遇和困难而更加明显。但他们也遭受着同样的孤立，同样的可怕分离。</p>
<p>To build this recognition experience for yourself, you must take the Steps to Knowledge. You must realize that who you are is not your mind or your body. Your mind and your body are vehicles of expression in the world. They give you the opportunity to be recognized here, to have an impact upon the world and to experience life at this level.</p>
<p>为你自己建立这种认知体验，你必须开展内识的进阶。你必须认识到，你是谁并不在于你的心灵或你的身体。你的心灵和你的身体是这个世界的表达载体。它们让你有机会在这里被认知，对世界产生影响，并体验这个层面的生命。</p>
<p>But who you are is beyond this. It is beyond any idea that you might have about yourself, for who you are is not just an idea. You may think of yourself in any number of ways, but who you are is beyond any ideas that you may entertain.</p>
<p>但你是谁却超越了这一点。你是谁超越了你对你自己的任何想法，因为你是谁不只是一个想法。你可以用各种方式看待你自己，但你是谁超越了你可能拥有的任何想法。</p>
<p>You experience this by going deeper within yourself, by practicing stillness, which gives you the chance to feel and experience your deeper nature. You do this by suspending judgment and condemnation so that you can be present for other people. You do this by deeply evaluating your life to see what is most important there, what is fundamental to your life and what is required of you to face the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world—Great Waves of change that will change and alter the circumstances for so many people, even in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>你可以通过深入你自己的内心，通过练习静止来体验这一点，这让你有机会感受和体验你更深层次的自然。你可以通过暂停评判和谴责来做到这一点，这样你就能为他人而存在。你可以通过深度评估你的生命来做到这一点，看看生命什么是最重要的，什么对你的生命来说是根本性的，以及你需要做什么来面对正在降临世界的变革巨浪——变革的巨浪将改变和转变许多人的境况，甚至在富裕国家也是如此。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world. It is a Message for the whole world, but it also establishes a path of redemption and empowerment for the individual. At the center of this is this recognition experience you have within yourself and with other people. It involves taking the Steps to Knowledge and learning a greater Wisdom about how to be in life in such a way that your greater purpose can emerge within you and become expressed where it is needed to be expressed. This involves finding certain people who share your greater purpose, and these will prove to be the greatest relationships you can possibly have here.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送了一条新讯息。这是给整个世界的讯息，但它也为个人建立了一条救赎和赋权之路。它的核心是你在你自己和他人身上拥有的认知体验。它涉及开展内识的进阶，学习一种更伟大的智慧，关于如何以这样的方式生活在生命中，让你的更伟大目的能够在你内心浮现，并在需要表达的地方得到表达。这涉及找到与你有着共同更伟大目的的某些人，这些人将被证明是你在这里可能拥有的最伟大的关系。</p>
<p>This fulfills the need of the soul. This breaks down the reality of isolation. This frees you from obsession and addiction. This reverses and overcomes the source of your suffering. Now you find yourself committed and devoted to others, and you find that others are committed and devoted to you, and that this devotion is based on a deeper recognition. It is beyond words and description, it is so profound.</p>
<p>这满足了灵魂的需求。这打破了孤立的现实。这让你摆脱了痴迷和上瘾。这扭转并克服了你痛苦的根源。现在你发现你自己对他人的忠诚和投入，你发现其他人也对你忠诚和投入，而这种投入是基于一种更深层次的认知。它是无法用语言描述的，它是如此深刻。</p>
<p>This alters your life so dramatically. You look around you and you look at people, and they are suffering because they are alone and are unrecognized. And all of their social behavior and their foolishness and their tragedy is expressing this desire and need to be recognized.</p>
<p>这极大地改变了你的生命。你环顾四周，看着人们，他们因为独自一人和不被认出而痛苦不堪。他们所有的社交行为、愚蠢和悲剧都表达了这种渴望和这种认出的需求。</p>
<p>If you listen carefully, even beyond what they are telling you or demonstrating to you, you will hear the great need of their soul, and you will feel compassion for them. You will see that even in their anger or their frustration, in their judgment or condemnation of others, you will see this need for recognition. This will temper your judgment of them.</p>
<p>如果你仔细聆听，甚至超越他们告诉你或向你展示的内容，你就会听到他们灵魂的伟大需求，你会对他们感到同情。你会看到，即使在他们的愤怒或沮丧中，在他们对他人的评判或谴责中，你也会看到这种对认知的需求。这会缓和你对他们的评判。</p>
<p>This will enable compassion to arise, naturally—not as a kind of forced exercise, but naturally. As you feel your own need to be recognized and to recognize yourself, you will see this in people around you, and it will move you. You will feel compassion for them, and you will see their dilemma.</p>
<p>这将使同情心自然而然地产生——不是作为一种强迫行为，而是自然而然地产生。当你感到你自己需要被认出和认识你自己时，你会在你周围的人身上看到这一点，他将推动你。你会对他们感到同情，你会看到他们的困境。</p>
<p>People act crazy when they go unrecognized. People do foolish things. People lash out at others because they are unrecognized. Of course this happens.</p>
<p>当人们不被认出时，他们就会变得疯狂。人们会做出愚蠢的事情。人们会因为不被认出而对他人大发雷霆。当然会发生这种情况。</p>
<p>Here you will see the greater need of the soul in others. If you can speak to this and be sensitive to this, you will be a light in the world. Your presence will nourish others. It will remind others that they are not alone and that they too have come into the world for a greater purpose. And they too are connected to God and to their Spiritual Family. And even though the world can present grim appearances, there is a greater network of relationships that exist here—underneath the surface, escaping the attention of people living at the surface, but there nonetheless.</p>
<p>在这里，你将看到他人灵魂的更伟大需求。如果你能谈论这个并对此敏感，你将是世界上的一束光。你的存在将滋养他人。它将提醒他人，他们并不孤单，他们也是为了一个更伟大目的来到这个世界。他们也和上帝、和他们的精神家庭联接在一起。尽管世界可能呈现出严峻的表象，但这里存在着一个更伟大的关系网络——在表面之下，躲过了生活在表面的人们的注意，但无论如何它就在那里。</p>
<p>When you are around other people, be neutral and observant. Look and listen for what people are really communicating through their behavior and their words. Ask yourself: “What is this person really communicating?”</p>
<p>当你与他人相处时，要保持中立和观察。观察和倾听人们通过他们的行为和言语真正传达的信息。问问你自己：“这个人真正传达的是什么？”</p>
<p>If you listen with this kind of attention, you might hear something very different from what they are saying or from what their appearance might be demonstrating. Then you can ask yourself: “Is this person ready to take the Steps to Knowledge?” If you ask this with this kind of objectivity, you might hear a yes or a no, or perhaps a maybe.</p>
<p>如果你用这种注意力去倾听，你可能会听到与他们所说的或他们的外表所展示的截然不同的事情。然后你可以问你自己：“这个人准备好踏上内识之路了吗？”如果你用这种客观的态度去问这个问题，你可能会听到一个肯定或否定的回答，或者也许是一个可能。</p>
<p>This is all listening at a deeper level. And listening here is very important. In the study of Steps to Knowledge, you learn how to listen within yourself. Instead of just trying to have immediate insights or ideas, you learn how to simply listen. In the practice of stillness, you are listening.</p>
<p>这一切都是在一个更深层次的层面上的倾听。倾听在这里非常重要。在学习内识进阶时，你将学会如何倾听你自己的内心。你不会只是试图获得即时的见解或想法，而是学会如何简单地倾听。在静止的实践中，你正在倾听。</p>
<p>As you develop this ability to listen, you learn how to listen to others. You learn how to become neutral when others are speaking to you so that you can hear what they are really saying, what they are really needing from you and what they are really trying to communicate even though they themselves cannot really express this clearly.</p>
<p>当你培养这种倾听能力时，你就会学会如何倾听他人。当他人和你说话时，你会学会如何保持中立，这样你就能听到他们真正在说什么，他们真正需要你做什么，他们真正想传达什么，即使他们自己无法清楚地表达这些。</p>
<p>This listening, this paying attention, is so important. You develop this skill within your practice in taking the Steps to Knowledge because these Steps will teach you how to listen within yourself. They will teach you how to become patient and observant. They will help you to settle down and become less restless. They will relieve you of your anxiety, which drives you constantly in life. They will enable you to experience your deeper feelings and emotions and to forgive those individuals and those circumstances that you feel have wounded you in the past.</p>
<p>这种聆听、这种关注非常重要。你在内识进阶的实践中发展了这种技能，因为这些步骤教你如何聆听你自己的内心。它们将教你如何变得有耐心和善于观察。它们将帮助你安定下来，变得不那么焦躁不安。它们将减轻你的焦虑，而焦虑是你在生命中不断前行的动力。它们将使你能够体验你更深层次的感受和情绪，并原谅那些你认为在过去伤害过你的人和那些情况。</p>
<p>Now you are learning to listen, and you are listening for the deeper current of your life. Now you are listening to others. This listening is so important because people need to be heard. Even the person ranting at the railway station who seems to be mad and crazy, even they are trying to be heard, and no one will listen to them. They are trying to be heard. And they are trying to be heard because they need recognition—not for who they think they are, not for their ideas, but for who they really are underneath all of that.</p>
<p>现在你正在学习聆听，你正在聆听你生命中更深层次的潮流。现在你正在聆听他人。这种聆听非常重要，因为人们需要被倾听。即使是火车站里那些看起来疯狂咆哮的人，他们也在试图被倾听，但没有人会听他们说话。他们试图被倾听。他们试图被听到，因为他们需要被认知——不是因为他们认为他们是谁，不是因为他们的想法，而是因为他们在所有这一切之下真正是谁。</p>
<p>Then when you are out in public and you look at the long faces and you look at people’s circumstances, you can see the results of their living without recognition. They might be married, they might have immense social contacts, but if there is not a deeper recognition, then they are still impoverished. And this generates suffering, frustration and anger.</p>
<p>然后，当你走在公众面前，看到人们愁眉苦脸的样子，看到他们的生活境况，你就会看到他们没有被认知的结果。他们可能结婚了，可能有广泛的社会联系，但如果没有一种更深层次的认知，那么他们仍然是贫穷的。这会产生痛苦、沮丧和愤怒。</p>
<p>We are giving you here the clue to really connecting with yourself and with other people. But you must be listening at a deeper level. That is why your practice in Steps to Knowledge is so essential, for this will teach you how to listen and how to feel and how to experience the deeper current of your life, which is the power and the presence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>我们在这里给你提供真正与你自己和他人联接的线索。但你必须在一种更深层次的层面上聆听。正因为如此，你在内识进阶中的实践是如此重要，因为这将教你如何聆听、如何感受以及如何体验你生命的更深层次的潮流，也就是你内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>As you develop this sensitivity and awareness, you will naturally apply it to other people. You will look beyond appearances. You will listen beyond people’s words. You do this so you can hear people. For many others, they will find relief in being with you because someone is really giving them some real attention—not just agreeing with them or their ideas, but paving the way for some kind of deeper recognition to occur.</p>
<p>当你发展出这种敏感性和觉知时，你自然会把它应用到其他人身上。你会看透表象。你会倾听人们的话语。你这样做是为了听取他人的意见。对许多人来说，他们会从与你在一起中得到安慰，因为有人真的在注意他们——不仅仅是同意他们或他们的想法，而是为某种更深层次的认知铺平道路。</p>
<p>You may have this experience with many people. So do not think that this means that you are to marry someone or spend your whole life with them because that is not the case at all. Should you become truly capable here, people will come to you for guidance and for reassurance. You will be able to contribute to people because you are having this recognition experience with them. In your life, you will find that certain people who are really ready to participate with you and who have the right qualities will come into your life to assist you with your greater work, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>你可能和许多人有过这种体验。所以不要认为这意味着你要嫁给某人或和他们共度一生，因为根本不是这样。如果你在这里真正有能力，人们就会来找你寻求指导和安慰。你将能够为人们做出贡献，因为你和他们有过这种认知体验。在你的生命中，你会发现某些真正准备好和你一起参与、拥有正确品质的人会进入你的生命，帮助你完成更伟大的工作，无论那是什么。</p>
<p>Here you have found the wealth of life and have learned to escape your impoverished condition of living at the surface of your mind, where there are only appearances. Now you are living a life based upon a deeper recognition, and this deeper recognition creates a deeper level of relationship with others.</p>
<p>在这里，你找到了生命的财富，学会了摆脱生活在心灵表面、只有表象的贫困状态。现在，你生活在一种基于更深层次认知的生命，这种更深层次的认知创造了与他人一种更深层次层面上的关系。</p>
<p>Here you are like water in a thirsty land. You are bringing nourishment to people because you yourself are nourished. You are speaking to the deeper need of the soul within the individual, and whether they can accept you or not, whether they can receive you or not, you are still having an impact. Here you are being known, and you are able to know others. And that is an unparalleled gift in this world.</p>
<p>在这里，你就像干渴土地上的水。你给人们带来滋养，因为你自己也得到了滋养。你在诉说个人灵魂深处的需求，无论他们是否接受你，无论他们是否可以接纳你，你仍然在产生影响。在这里，你的存在被人知道，你也能够知道他人的存在。这是这个世界上无与伦比的礼物。</p>
