<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 6, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年2月6日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have come here for a greater purpose. You were born with the Knowledge of what you must do, what you must accomplish, who you must meet and where you must go. It is time to find this Knowledge and begin to live it.</p>
<p>你来到这里是为了一个更伟大的目的。你生来就知道你必须做什么、必须完成什么、必须遇见谁、必须去哪里。现在是时候找到这个内识并开始实践它们了。</p>
<p>The Knowledge that you possess is directly connected and responsive to the evolution of the world, and though you have spent most of your life developing yourself as a person—developing your personal skills and being conditioned by your society and its institutions—this Knowledge lives within you at this moment.</p>
<p>你所拥有的内识与世界的进化直接相关且相互响应，尽管你生命中的大部分时间都在发展你自己——发展你的个人技能并受到社会及其制度的制约——但这个内识此刻就存在于你的内心。</p>
<p>When I say you have come to the world for a great purpose, do not think of grandiose roles for yourself. Do not think you are going to become a great emancipator or a great healer. Rather, your role will be more mundane and more hidden, but it will be quite specific, and it will be vital in the larger scheme of things.</p>
<p>当我说你来到这个世界是为了一个伟大的目的时，不要为你自己想着宏伟的角色。不要认为你会成为一个伟大的解放者或伟大的治疗者。相反，你的角色将更加平凡和隐秘，但它将非常具体，并且在更大的范围内至关重要。</p>
<p>You cannot figure this out on your own because you only hold part of the puzzle to the reality and the meaning of this greater purpose for you. To find the rest of the parts, to complete the picture, you must find those key individuals who are destined to participate with you in your greater purpose and mission.</p>
<p>你无法独自解决这个问题，因为你只掌握了拼图的一部分，而这个更伟大的目的对你来说就是现实和意义。要想找到其余的部分，要完成这幅图景，你必须找到那些注定要与你一起参与你的更伟大目的和使命的关键人物。</p>
<p>Understanding this, you can see why there is an incessant quest for relationship. Even though people’s romantic endeavors have produced enormous pain and cost, they keep trying to establish a real connection somewhere. Why else would they continue something that has so little success and such great costs?</p>
<p>理解了这一点，你就能看到为什么人们不断追求恋爱关系。尽管人们的恋爱努力带来了巨大的痛苦和代价，但他们仍试图在某个地方建立真正的联系。否则他们为什么还要继续做这种收效甚微、代价如此巨大的事情呢？</p>
<p>Despite all of the fantasy surrounding romantic relationships, in spite of all of the misunderstanding regarding this, there is a genuine motivation to connect with certain people for a certain purpose. And though, for most people, this drive is largely unconscious, it is very powerful nonetheless.</p>
<p>尽管人们对浪漫关系抱有种种幻想，尽管对此存在种种误解，但人们确实有出于特定的目的与特定的人建立联系的真正动机。尽管对大多数人来说，这种驱动力在很大程度上是无意识的，但它仍然非常强大。</p>
<p>You must find those key individuals with whom you share a destiny. They hold the rest of the pieces of the puzzle to the mystery of your life. That is why you cannot find the way on your own. You can begin on your own. You can advance. But you cannot fulfill what you are here to do on your own.</p>
<p>你必须找到那些与你共享天命的关键人物。他们掌握着你生命之谜的其余部分。这就是为什么你无法独自找到道路。你可以独自开始。你可以前进。但你无法独自完成你来这里要做的事情。</p>
<p>As We have said, Knowledge will bring important people into your life to assist you. Not all of them represent the key people that We are speaking of, but they will all play an important role in your development. However, there are a few key people that you must meet. Knowledge within you will attempt to bring them to you or bring you to them. It will attempt to bring you together in any way that is possible. Likewise, Knowledge within them will attempt to do the same.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，内识会把重要的人带进你的生命来帮助你。他们并非都是我们所说的关键人物，但他们都将在你的发展中扮演重要角色。然而，有几个关键角色你必须去见。你内在的内识会试图把他们带到你身边，或者把你带到他们身边。它会试图以任何可能的方式把你们聚集在一起。同样，他们内在的内识也会试图做同样的事情。</p>
<p>But Knowledge does not overwhelm the person. It is not a tyrant. It does not dominate. It does not rule in a harsh manner. Rather, it gives its influence and attempts to keep the person moving in a positive direction, in the direction they are meant to go.</p>
<p>但内识不会压倒人。它不是暴君。它不会主宰。它不会以严厉的方式统治。相反，它施加影响，并试图让人们朝着积极的方向前进，朝着他们应该去的方向前进。</p>
<p>Not everything that happens to you is predetermined, but there are certain things you must do and certain people you must meet and certain activities you must participate in. How this can come about can happen in many different ways, but certain key elements must be there. You cannot replace these. You must find your purpose, your people and your mission in life.</p>
<p>并非所有发生在你身上的事情都是注定的，但有些事情你必须做，有些人你必须遇到，有些活动你必须参加。实现这一点的方式可能有很多种，但某些关键因素必须存在。这些因素是无法替代的。你必须在生命中找到你的目的、你的人和你的使命。</p>
<p>In many forms of spiritual teaching and practice, people are encouraged to be concerned about their destiny beyond the world, for example, whether they will go to Heaven or Hell, or whether they will elevate to another level and so on and so forth. There is a wide variety of ideas and beliefs associated with this, but for many this is a primary focus. But this is not Our focus, and this is not the focus of Greater Community Spirituality.</p>
<p>在许多形式的精神教导和实践中，人们被鼓励去关心他们在世界之外的天命，例如，他们会去天堂还是地狱，或者他们是否会提升到另一个层面，等等。与此相关的想法和信仰种类繁多，但对许多人来说，这是主要关注点。但这不是我们的关注点，也不是大社区精神性的关注点。</p>
<p>When you leave this world, you will go home to your Spiritual Family. They are watching over you now, and they are waiting for you when you return. You must return there; you have no choice. You cannot stay in the world forever; over that you have no choice.</p>
<p>当你离开这个世界时，你会回到你的精神家庭。他们现在正在守护着你，当你回来时，他们正在等待你。你必须回到那里；你别无选择。你不能永远留在这个世界上；对此你别无选择。</p>
<p>It is what you are able to accomplish here that will make all the difference. It will make the difference in terms of your development and in terms of your Spiritual Family advancing. Your Spiritual Family is comprised of individuals who are directly connected to you at the level of Knowledge, who share a specific set of missions and accomplishments with you. Your Spiritual Family will ultimately join with other Spiritual Families, like the rivers joining together on their way to the sea.</p>
<p>正是你在这里能够完成的事情，才会带来所有的改变。它会让你的发展和你的精神家庭的进步产生巨大的改变。你的精神家庭由在内识层面上与你直接联接的个体组成，他们与你分享一套特定的使命和成就。你的精神家庭最终会与其他精神家庭联合，就像河流汇入大海一样。</p>
<p>What distinguishes one Spiritual Family from another only has to do with the nature of accomplishment and the activities that must be carried out in manifest life. There is no opposition between Spiritual Families; they are all working towards the same goal. But the Creator realizes that individuals work better in small groups to which they can become accountable, and so this is part of the Greater Plan for the reclamation of all separate beings.</p>
<p>一个精神家庭与另一个精神家庭的区别只在于成就的性质和显现生命中必须进行的活动。精神家庭之间没有对立；他们都在为同一个目标而努力。但造物主意识到，个人在可以对其负责的小团体中工作得更好，因此这是恢复所有单独生命的更伟大计划的一部分。</p>
<p>The critical questions are: What is your destiny in the world? What are you here to do and how will it be accomplished? These are the critical questions for you, and these should be the critical questions in all spiritual traditions.</p>
<p>关键问题是：你在这个世界上的天命是什么？你来这里要做什么，又将如何实现？这些是对你来说至关重要的问题，也应该是所有精神传统中的关键问题。</p>
<p>Yes, there is a reward in the afterlife. If you are successful here, you will bring great success with you to your Spiritual Family. And if you are not successful here, then you will return and realize that you must come back and try again. The reward in a sense is that you will not have to come back and try again. We think that is a very worthwhile reward.</p>
<p>是的，来世会有回报。如果你在这里成功了，你就会给你的精神家庭带来伟大的成功。如果你在这里没有成功，那么你会回来，意识到你必须回来再试一次。从某种意义上说，回报是你不必回来再试一次。我们认为这是一个非常有价值的回报。</p>
<p>Therefore, focus on the question about your destiny in the world. Your heritage is established. Your destiny beyond this world is established. You are blessed in the sight of the Creator, for the Creator only knows who you really are. You must find out who you really are while you are in the world and allow Knowledge within you to express itself and contribute to the world through you.</p>
<p>因此，关注你在世界上的天命问题。你的传承已经确立。你在这个世界之外的天命已经确立。在造物主的眼中你是被祝福的，因为只有造物主知道你真正是谁。你必须在身处世界上时发现你真正是谁，并允许你内在的内识表达它自己并通过你为世界做出贡献。</p>
<p>This is the only mastery that is possible here, and this is the mastery that is needed. If you can accomplish this, you will seem masterful compared to others, but you will come to understand that you are not the real master. The master is working through you and with you and for you and for others and for the whole world. This is the mastery.</p>
<p>这是这里唯一可能的大师，也是需要的大师。如果你能做到这一点，你会比其他人看起来更熟练，但你会理解你不是真正的大师。大师通过你、与你一起、为你、为他人、为整个世界工作。这就是大师。</p>
<p>It could be said that The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is The Greater Community Way of Relationship. For the way out of isolation and self-absorption is to develop meaningful and purposeful relationships with people, with possessions, with places, with everything. This is what ends Separation. This is what restores meaning and value to all things that have been degraded before.</p>
<p>可以说，大社区内识之路就是大社区的关系之路。因为摆脱孤立和自我沉迷的方法是与人、与财产、与地方、与一切事物建立有意义和有目的的关系。这才是结束分离的办法。这才是恢复所有以前被贬低的事物的意义和价值的办法。</p>
<p>Ultimately, your spiritual advancement is the ability to join in greater and greater panoramas of relationship. You cannot simply unite with everything. You must begin to unite incrementally, though it is believed by many and hoped by many more that you can simply jump from your isolated state into the Mind of God and disappear there. But it is really not like that. It is that you are able to join together in serving people. You are able to join with Knowledge. You are able to join your mind and your body together. You are able to establish meaningful relationships with people and purposeful relationships with people. It is all a transformation of relationship.</p>
<p>最终，你的精神进步是能够参与越来越广泛的关系。你无法简单地与一切联合。你必须开始逐渐联合，尽管许多人相信，也有更多人希望，你能从孤立的状态跳入上帝的心灵，然后消失在那里。但事实并非如此。而是你能够联合起来为人们服务。你能够与内识联合。你能够将你的心灵和你的身体联合起来。你能够与人们建立有意义的关系和有目的的关系。这都是关系的转变。</p>
<p>Before this, people attempt to use people to fulfill their ideas or to fortify their self-identity. Relationship is more a form of usury than companionship. People bond together for financial advantage, for beauty, for pleasure, for excitement, but they rarely know one another.</p>
<p>在此之前，人们试图利用他人来实现他们的想法或强化自我认同。关系更像是一种高利贷，而不是陪伴。人们为了经济利益、为了美丽、为了快乐、为了刺激而结合在一起，但他们很少相互知道对方。</p>
<p>The great transformation occurs when you can establish relationships based upon Knowledge and based upon purpose. This is an entirely different foundation for relationship and one that is sound and strong and will yield for everyone involved a greater wisdom and a greater ability.</p>
<p>当你能够基于内识和目的建立关系时，伟大的转变就会发生。这是一个完全不同的关系基础，它健全而强大，将为每个参与的人带来更伟大的智慧和更伟大的能力。</p>
<p>In Greater Community Spirituality, there are no great individuals. There are no heroes and heroines. But there are great relationships and there are great communities. What makes a great relationship is the greatness that each person can bring to it—not their ideals and their aspirations and their ambitions, their wealth and their possessions, but the greatness of their Being and what they can produce and create in life together.</p>
<p>在大社区精神性中，没有伟大的个人。没有英雄和女英雄。但有伟大的关系和伟大的社区。成就伟大关系的是每个人的伟大之处——不是他们的理想、他们的抱负、他们的野心、他们的财富和他们的财产，而是他们存在的伟大之处，以及他们在生命中一起产生和创造的事情。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you knows that you cannot accomplish your task alone, and it also knows that you cannot accomplish your task with whomever you choose. There are only certain people who can really help you, who you really need, and you do really need them.</p>
<p>你内在的内识知道你无法独自完成你的任务，它也知道你无法与你选择的人一起完成你的任务。只有特定的人可以真正帮助你，你实际需要他们，而你也确实需要他们。</p>
<p>They have a responsibility to find you, and you have a responsibility to find them. They have a responsibility to be ready to participate with you in an intended way as you have a responsibility to participate with them in the intended way.</p>
<p>他们有责任找到你，你也有责任找到他们。他们有责任准备好以预期的方式与你一起参与，而你也有责任以预期的方式与他们一起参与。</p>
<p>It is your ability to join in relationships that represent Knowledge and real purpose in life that is a great accomplishment because these relationships will give to the world around them. They will yield far more than they take. They will create; they will produce; they will serve. They represent the real promise for humanity. And though they might seem mundane on the outside, within themselves there is a spiritual Fire burning now so hot and so bright that it will be able to illuminate others who come into proximity to these relationships.</p>
<p>你有能力加入代表内识的关系和真正生命目的的关系中，这是一项伟大的成就，因为这些关系将为周围的世界做出贡献。它们的收获将远远超过它们的索取。它们将创造；它们将生产；它们将服务。它们代表着人类真正的承诺。虽然他们外表看似平凡，但在他们的内心深处，有一团精神之火正在燃烧，它是如此炽热、如此明亮，以至于能够照亮与这些关系接近的其他人。</p>
<p>You already have great relationships, so take heart. The Unseen Ones are with you. They will not interfere in your personal life and only under very, very rare circumstances will they reveal themselves to you. But the greatness of this relationship is already with you.</p>
<p>你已经拥有了伟大的关系，因此振作起来。不可见者与你同在。他们不会干涉你的个人生命，只有在极少数情况下他们才会向你透露他们自己的身份。但这种关系的伟大之处已经与你同在。</p>
<p>They are not here to give you everything that you want. They are not here to make your life wonderfully comfortable and easy. They are not here to smooth your way so that there are no bumps in your road. Instead, they are here to remind you of your purpose, of your decision to come into the world and of the greater nature and gift that you possess that must be discovered and reclaimed.</p>
<p>他们来这里不是为了给你你想要的一切。他们来这里不是为了让你的生命变得非常舒适和轻松。他们来这里不是为了让你的道路平坦，让你的道路上没有坎坷。相反，他们来这里是为了提醒你，你的目的，你来到这个世界的决定，以及你必须发现和重新获得的更伟大的自然和你所拥有的礼物。</p>
<p>You cannot use them to gain advantages in life; you cannot employ them to help you fulfill your personal goals. They cannot be used and manipulated. That is how great they are. They in a sense are a model for the relationship that you need to establish with those key individuals that you are destined to meet.</p>
<p>你无法利用他们在生命中获得优势；你无法利用他们来帮助你实现个人目标。他们无法被利用和操纵。这就是他们的伟大之处。从某种意义上说，他们是你需要与那些你注定会遇到的关键个人建立关系的典范。</p>
<p>There is a great deal that must be taught concerning relationships—the establishment of relationships of Knowledge, the maintenance of relationships of Knowledge and the fulfillment of relationships of Knowledge. To learn more about this, you must read Our forthcoming book, Relationships and Higher Purpose. But for now it is important to gain a perspective and a basic understanding that in The Way of Knowledge, you will not journey alone. Certain others who are sharing this mysterious and great path with you will be called to abide with you and to assist you.</p>
<p>关于关系，必须教导的内容非常多——内识关系的建立、内识关系的维护以及内识关系的实现。要学习这方面的更多，你必须阅读我们即将出版的书《关系与更高宗旨》。但现在重要的是获得一个视角和一个基本的理解，即在内识之路上，你不会独自前行。与你共享这条神秘而伟大道路的某些人将被召唤来与你同行并帮助你。</p>
<p>There will be no heroes. There will be no avatars. There will be no perfect beings. There will only be students of Knowledge at different levels of accomplishment.</p>
<p>不会有英雄。不会有化身。不会有完美的人。只会有不同成就水平的内识学生。</p>
<p>The real master is Knowledge. That is the work of the Divine within your life and within the world, working behind the scenes to reclaim the separated through Knowledge.</p>
<p>真正的主人是内识。这是神圣在你生命和世界中的工作，在幕后工作，通过内识找回被分离的人。</p>
<p>It is critically important that you realize that you have a destiny within the world and that the meaning and nature of this destiny is determined by where you have come from and where you will ultimately go, for that is where your mission is set. That is where your goals are established. But they are meant to be expressed and carried out right here in the world—in the world of mundane things and mundane situations, the world of conflict and difficulty, beauty and opportunity.</p>
<p>至关重要的是，你要意识到你在这个世界上有一个天命，这个天命的意义和自然取决于你来自哪里以及你最终将去往何处，因为这是你的使命所在。这是你的目标所在。但它们注定要在这个世界中表达和实现——在这个充满世俗事物和平凡处境的世界，在这个充满冲突和困难、美丽和机会的世界。</p>
<p>How will you find your destiny? Well, your destiny can only be known. You may have any idea you want about it. You may formulate any belief. You may build a complicated system of ideas based upon your preferences and your past experience, but this is not destiny.</p>
<p>你将如何找到你的天命？好吧，你的天命只能被知道。你可以对它有任何想法。你可以形成任何信念。你可以根据你的偏好和过去的经历建立一个复杂的想法体系，但这不是天命。</p>
<p>Destiny happens in a whole different part of you. It is something you cannot eradicate from your Being. You cannot change it; you cannot alter it; you cannot make it do what you want it to do in the moment. It is there like a blueprint within you. It will require the involvement of others in a very specific way, for you must learn that you can do nothing alone and that everything that is created, by anyone at any time in any place throughout the Greater Community, is the result of this kind of relationship.</p>
<p>天命发生在你完全不同的部分。它是你无法从你的存在中根除的内识。你无法改变它；你无法更改它；你无法让它做你想让它在当下做的事。它就像你内心的蓝图一样。它将需要其他人以非常特殊的方式参与，因为你必须学会​​你无法独自一人做任何事情，在整个大社区中，任何人在任何时间、任何地点所创造的一切，都是这种关系的结果。</p>
<p>In this world, many people are preoccupied with marriage, partnership like this, but that may not be their greatest need. Their yearning for relationship is genuine, but their interpretation may be in error. You need to be able to unite with others to produce great things because alone you cannot produce great things.</p>
<p>在这个世界上，许多人都专注于婚姻、伴侣关系之类的，但这可能不是他们最大的需求。他们对关系的渴望是真实的，但他们的解读可能是错误的。你需要能够与他人团结起来才能创造伟大的事情，因为你独自一人无法创造伟大的事情。</p>
<p>Everything is the product of relationship. Everything that is created is the product of relationship. Everything that is contributed is the product of relationship. That is why The Way of Knowledge is The Way of Relationship.</p>
<p>一切都是关系的产物。一切创造都是关系的产物。一切贡献都是关系的产物。这就是为什么内识之路就是关系之路。</p>
<p>People are very pessimistic about relationships based upon their past experience and based upon what they see demonstrated within the world. And so they try to think, “Well, I have to do it on my own. I must learn to be complete within myself. I cannot rely upon anyone else.” Though understandable, this reaction cannot produce success.</p>
<p>人们基于过去的经验以及他们所看到的世界上的情况，对关系非常悲观。因此，他们试图想：“好吧，我必须依靠自己。我必须学会自我完善。我不能依赖任何人。”这种反应虽然可以理解，但却无法取得成功。</p>
<p>The key is to become a man or a woman of Knowledge, for your great relationships will be built upon your ability to do this. This is what you bring to the relationship of destiny.</p>
<p>关键是要成为一个内识的男人或女人，因为你的伟大关系将建立在你做到这一点的能力之上。这就是给你带来天命关系的内识。</p>
<p>For even should you find that person you are destined to meet, if you are not ready to participate, or if they are not ready to participate, or if you both are not ready to participate to carry out and to fulfill what you came here to do, it will produce great conflict for you. It is better that you do not find each other until you are ready and that you concentrate instead upon becoming ready—ready for each other and ready for the life that you are meant to live and the gifts that you are meant to give.</p>
<p>因为即使你找到了你注定要遇见的那个人，如果你还没有准备好参与，或者他们还没有准备好参与，或者你们双方都没有准备好参与去实践和实现你们来此要做的事情，这将给你们带来巨大的冲突。你们最好在准备好之前不要去找对方，而是专注于做好准备——为彼此做好准备，为你们注定要过的生命做好准备，为你们注定要给予的礼物做好准备。</p>
<p>Here you will not remove yourself from society and meditate for long hours, trying to break through the fabric of the mind. That is only meant for a very few people who have a very specific purpose. The fact that it has become popular or socially acceptable in certain places does not mean that it is the way for you.</p>
<p>在这里，你不会脱离社会，长时间冥想，试图突破心灵的束缚。那只是为极少数有非常明确目的的人准备的。它在某些地方流行或被社会接受，并不意味着它适合你。</p>
<p>As We have said, the world’s emergence into the Greater Community will forever change humanity’s understanding of religion and spirituality. It will change the context. Now you must find a greater God and a greater religion and a greater spirituality.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，世界向大社区的迈进将永远改变人类对宗教和精神性的理解。它将改变背景。现在你们必须找到一个更伟大的上帝、一个更伟大的宗教和一个更伟大的精神性。</p>
<p>It is a spirituality of community. In the Greater Community, what can an individual do? What kind of power can they yield? What kind of influence can they have? It is a different environment.</p>
<p>这是一种社区的精神性。在大社区里，个体能做什么呢？能发挥什么样的力量？能产生什么样的影响力？它是一个不同的环境。</p>
<p>The social development that has occurred there has generated group mind. Tremendously powerful it can be if it is used wisely with Knowledge. Without Knowledge, like anything else, it becomes destructive and manipulative.</p>
<p>大社区发生的社会发展出了群体心灵。如果明智地使用内识，群体心灵将非常强大。如果没有内识，它就会像其他任何事物一样变得具有破坏性和操纵性。</p>
<p>Your destiny in life requires the development of others, specifically those others with whom you are meant to be engaged. You, therefore, practice in The Way of Knowledge, not just for yourself, but for them as well. They practice not just for themselves, but for you as well. You are now relying upon each other to become successful.</p>
<p>你在生命中的天命需要他人的发展，特别是那些注定与你交往的人。因此，你实践内识之路，不仅是为了你自己，也是为了他们。他们的实践不仅是为了他们自己，也是为了你。你们现在依靠彼此来取得成功。</p>
<p>This is how things happen in life. This is part of the Greater Plan. People must be taken out of their self-obsession and self-absorption into meaningful relationship in order to understand their true nature and their purpose for being in the world. This is fundamental.</p>
<p>这就是生命中发生的事情。这是更伟大计划的一部分。人们必须摆脱自我痴迷和自我沉迷，投入有意义的关系中，才能理解他们的真实自然和存在于世界的目的。这是基础。</p>
<p>It is now made even more urgent by the presence of the Greater Community, for they recognize that individual power is insignificant unless you are dealing with individuals of Knowledge. And those individuals will not be individuals alone for long, for they must join with others because Knowledge always leads people to join in meaningful relationships. Yes, they are still individuals, but now they have a greater Being and a greater identity. They are greater than the sum of their individual parts.</p>
<p>现在，大社区的存在使得这个问题变得更加紧迫，因为他们认识到，除非他们面对的是内识个体，否则个体的力量是微不足道的。而那些个体不会长期孤单，因为他们必须与他人结合，因为内识总是引导人们建立有意义的关系。是的，他们仍然是个体，但现在他们拥有一个更伟大的存在和一个更伟大的身份。它们的整体力量大于其个体部分的总和。</p>
<p>This represents a formidable power in the Greater Community. These individuals together cannot be manipulated. Their mental environment cannot be dominated. Regardless of what you might do to convince them or to persuade them, to induce them or to discourage them, because of the strength of Knowledge in their relationships, they are beyond your influence. You cannot see them, but they can see you. You cannot discern them, but they can discern you.</p>
<p>这代表着大社区里一种强大的力量。这些个体合在一起是无法被操纵的。他们的心理环境是无法被主宰的。无论你如何说服或劝说他们、诱导或劝阻他们，由于他们关系中内识的力量，他们超出了你的影响范围。你无法看见他们，但他们能够看见你。你无法辨别他们，但他们能够辨别你。</p>
<p>Perhaps this does not seem important to you yet at this moment. Perhaps you will say, “Well, that is not what I need right now.” But it is what you will need. It is what the world will need. And in effect, you do need it right now because you do need to offset the influences that are guiding your life. You do need to reclaim your authority. You do need to exercise your authority. You do need to find your authority. And you need to find those people who can help you do this because you cannot journey in The Way of Knowledge alone. How can one person alone undo their own conditioning and offset the conditioning of the world? People have tried, but that is not the way.</p>
<p>或许此刻这对你来说还不重要。或许你会说：“好吧，这不是我现在需要的。”但这是你将需要的。这是世界将需要的。实际上，你现在确实需要它，因为你确实需要抵消那些引导你生命的影响力。你确实需​​要重获你的权威。你确实需​​要运用你的权威。你确实需​​要找到你的权威。你需要找到那些可以帮助你做到这一点的人，因为你无法独自在内识之路上前行。一个人如何能够独自解除他们自身的制约并抵消世界的制约呢？人们已经尝试过了，但这是行不通的。</p>
<p>Men and women of Knowledge join together in alliances and in communities of Knowledge. They have their great allies. They require these relationships in order to be strong and focused. They cannot carry out their activities alone, for they need the cooperation and support of others. They need to be known and recognized by someone else.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人和女人联合起来，组成内识的联盟和社区。他们拥有伟大的盟友。他们需要这些关系来变得强大和专注。他们无法独自开展活动，因为他们需要他人的合作与支持。他们需要被他人知道和认可。</p>
<p>This confirmation amplifies their ability and confirms the true nature of their Being and their purpose. Everyone in the world needs this confirmation, but you must be prepared in order to understand it and to utilize it properly.</p>
<p>这种确认会增强他们的能力，并确认他们存在的真实自然和目的。世界上每个人都需要这种确认，但你必须做好准备，才能理解它并正确善用它。</p>
<p>There are strong relationships needed in the world. The potential is here. Humanity has always had strong relationships, but they have been too rare. There have been too few of them. This needs to grow in people’s experience. The fear, the doubt, the hostility, the cynicism need to be dispelled by a demonstration of true union and true ability. These relationships you cannot establish with everyone, for you are only destined to have them with certain people, but that will be a challenge in and of itself.</p>
<p>这个世界需要强大的关系。潜力就在这里。人类一直拥有强大的关系，但这种关系太罕见了。这种关系太少了。这需要在人们的体验中成长。恐惧、怀疑、敌意、愤世嫉俗需要通过展示真实的团结和真实的能力来消除。你无法与每个人建立这些关系，因为你注定只能与特定的人建立这种关系，但这本身就是一个挑战。</p>
<p>Yet it is bringing Knowledge into the experience of daily life and into the greater comprehension of the world that will make the critical difference. This is what will engender the courage, the selflessness and the ability to meet the problems of the world and the greater problems you will encounter in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然而，正是把内识带进日常生命的体验里、带进对世界的更伟大理解中，才将带来关键的不同。这将带来勇气、无私和能力，去面对世界的问题以及你们将在大社区里遭遇的更伟大问题。</p>
<p>Your true heritage is built upon real relationship. Your true destiny is built upon real relationship. And your calling in the world will be built upon true relationship. Yes, you will find the people you need, but you must be ready. That is the emphasis. Right now you are not ready. Perhaps they are not ready either.</p>
<p>你真实的传承建立在真正的关系之上。你真实的天命建立在真正的关系之上。你在世界上的召唤也将建立在真正的关系之上。是的，你会找到你需要的人，但你必须做好准备。这就是重点。现在你还没有准备好。也许他们也没有准备好。</p>
<p>They will not come to you by chance though your meeting may be very circumstantial. Being with them may not be easy because you will both have to get beyond your personality in order to deal with the reality of your relationship.</p>
<p>尽管你们的相遇可能非常偶然，但他们不会偶然来到你身边。与他们相处可能并不容易，因为你们都必须超越你们的人性，才能处理好你们关系的现实。</p>
<p>Before this can happen, you will have to gain the discernment to know what a relationship of destiny is and to distinguish it from a relationship of preference and desire. You can have strong preferences. You can have strong desires. You can build seemingly strong relationships based upon this, but these relationships are not really strong, and they will fail within the context of a real life. They will not have the foundation or the substance to support the revelation of Knowledge.</p>
<p>在这一切发生之前，你必须获得辨别力，去知道天命关系的内识，并把它与偏好和欲望关系区分开来。你可以有强烈的偏好。你可以有强烈的欲望。你可以基于此构建看似牢固的关系，但这些关系并非真正牢固，它们将在一个真正生命的背景下失败。它们将没有基础或实质来支持内识的启示。</p>
<p>How will you know who to be with and who not to be with? You will know. To gain a deeper understanding of this, it is essential to become a student of Knowledge and to learn the teaching on relationships within The Greater Community Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你怎么知道该和谁在一起，不该和谁在一起？你会知道的。为了更深入地理解这一点，你必须成为一名内识的学生，并学习大社区内识之路中关于关系的教导。</p>
<p>In this sense, what has been accomplished in the Greater Community far exceeds what has been demonstrated here in the world. It is not simply technology or the ability to get around, the ability to travel from one world to another. That is all machinery. But the ability to develop real and meaningful relationships and communities, this is something that is rare in the Greater Community but has been achieved at very high levels.</p>
<p>从这个意义上来说，大社区所取得的成就远远超过这个世界所展现的。它不仅仅是技术，或是出行的能力，从一个世界旅行到另一个世界的能力。这都是机器。但发展真正而有意义的关系和社区的能力，这在大社区中都是罕见的，但却在非常高的水平上实现了。</p>
<p>Most societies in the Greater Community are not communities of Knowledge. They are communities of law. They require a very strict obedience, conformity, a highly regulated life for their members. You would find living in most of them to be quite intolerable.</p>
<p>大社区中的大多数社会都不是内识的社区。它们是法制社区。它们要求其成员严格服从、一致、过着受严格管控的生命。你会发现，生活在其中的大多数社会是相当难以忍受的。</p>
<p>And yet they have power. It may not be the power of Knowledge, but they have power—power in the physical realm and power in the mental environment. They gain their cooperation through force and through enforcement, not through Knowledge.</p>
<p>然而他们拥有力量。它或许不是内识的力量，但他们拥有力量——物质领域的力量和心理环境的力量。他们通过武力和强制获得合作，而非通过内识。</p>
<p>The communities of Knowledge that exist in the Greater Community are small and withdrawn. Their allegiance is natural. Their power is unique.</p>
<p>大社区里存在的内识社区规模是小而隐秘的。他们的忠诚是自然的。他们的力量是独特的。</p>
<p>We share these things with you to give you an understanding and a perspective about the nature of power in the world and how Knowledge functions within the world—quietly behind the scenes. This gives you an idea of how you will function in the future.</p>
<p>我们与你分享这些，是为了让你理解并看到这个世界的力量本质，以及内识如何在这个世界中——在幕后——悄悄地运作。这让你知道你的未来将如何运作。</p>
<p>For as you learn to become wise, you will not want recognition. You will only want recognition from those who can truly know you. You may want your works to be recognized and to be studied and to be utilized, but you yourself will not want recognition.</p>
<p>因为当你学会变得明智时，你不会想要得到认可。你只会想要那些真正知道你的人的认可。你可能希望你的作品被认可、被研究和被善用，但你自己并不想要得到这种认可。</p>
<p>You have a destiny within the world. It will require great relationships. Your ability to find these and to participate in them will be the result of your preparation in The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你在世上有一个天命。它需要伟大的关系。你找到这些关系并参与其中的能力将是你在内识之路上准备的结果。</p>
<p>Take heart, then. There is something great for you. Great things are happening in the world. Yes, they are risky, but they are also promising. Take heart. You will not travel this journey alone, but you must prepare and you must be patient. You will not be able to find your way all at once.</p>
<p>因此，振作起来。对你来说，这是一件伟大的事情。世界上正在发生伟大的事情。是的，它们有风险，但也充满承诺。振作起来。你不会独自踏上这段旅程，但你必须做好准备，你必须有耐心。你不可能一下子就找到你的路。</p>
<p>From where you stand today to the full experience of your destiny in the world, there are many, many steps, and you do not have a great deal of time. That is why you feel this sense of urgency. And if this sense of urgency is denied, you will feel depression.</p>
<p>从你今天所处的位置到充分体验你在世上的天命，还有许多许多步骤，而你没有太多的时间。这就是为什么你会感到这种紧迫感。如果这种紧迫感被否定，你就会感到沮丧。</p>
<p>Look into your heart, then, and you will know. You will respond at a deeper level and not all at once. The calling is subtle, but it is continuous. The opportunity is hidden, but it is there. The reality is beyond your vision, but it can be seen.</p>
<p>因此，进入你的内心，你就会知道。你会在更深层次的层面上做出回应，而不是一下子。召唤是微妙的，但它是持续的。机会是隐藏的，但它就在那里。现实超出了你的视野，但它是可见的。</p>
<p>Knowledge will take you there, but first you must find Knowledge. You must unite with Knowledge. You must learn how to become wise and discerning with Knowledge. You do not simply give yourself up with Knowledge. You bring your strength to Knowledge, and you learn how to become stronger.</p>
<p>内识会带你到达那里，但首先你必须找到内识。你必须与内识结合。你必须学会​​如何通过内识变得明智和明辨是非。在内识面前，你不能简单地放弃你自己。你将你的力量带给内识，并学会如何变得更强大。</p>
<p>This is bringing all aspects of yourself together in their rightful order. It is entirely natural, but in order to do it, you must unlearn what has been unnatural. This is what is set out before you now.</p>
<p>这就是将你自己的各个方面按照正确的顺序组合在一起。这是完全自然的，但为了做到这一点，你必须忘记那些不自然的事情。这就是现在摆在你面前的工作。</p>
<p>We emphasize the reality of the Greater Community because this is the greater context for realizing who you are, why you are here and what you must do. You cannot create a context yourself and be able to understand these things.</p>
<p>我们强调大社区的现实，因为这是认识你是谁、你为何在此以及你必须做什么的更伟大背景。你无法为你自己创造一个背景并能够理解这些事情。</p>
<p>Here you must look into the world and you must look into yourself. Rather than trying to impose your values upon the world, trying to impose your goals upon life, trying to extract the rewards you want from life itself, you come into a dynamic relationship with life.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须观察并进入世界，你也必须观察你自己并进入。你不是试图将你的价值观强加于世界，不是试图将你的目标强加于生命，不是试图从生命本身获取你想要的回报，而是与生命建立一种动态的关系。</p>
<p>Here you stop resisting being in the world. Here you outgrow your ambivalence about being here. Here you gain a real foundation.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再抗拒身处这个世界。在这里，你不再对身处这个世界感到矛盾。在这里，你获得了一个真正的基础。</p>
<p>It is remarkable that many people in the world today have not really decided to be here. It is like they have one foot out the door. That is why so many people live in fantasy. That is why so many people have disengaged from reality. That is why so many people are lost within their own minds. That is why so many people are disassociated and alone and isolated.</p>
<p>值得注意的是，当今世界上的许多人并没有真正决定要来到这里。他们就像一只脚已经踏出家门。这就是为什么这么多人生活在幻想中。这就是为什么这么多人脱离了现实。这就是为什么这么多人迷失在他们自己的心灵中。这就是为什么这么多人疏离、孤独和孤立。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge brings you into contact with what is great and small—what is great within you and what is small within you, what is great within the world and what is small within the world. It sets a clear distinction that you can experience. It makes things clear because things are clear when you can see them clearly.</p>
<p>内识之路让你接触伟大与渺小——你内心的伟大与渺小，世界中的伟大与渺小。它设定了清晰的区分，你可以体验到它们。它让事物变得清晰，因为当你能清楚地看到它们时，事物就变得清晰了。</p>
<p>You know, there is a prevailing attitude in the world today that everything is quite relative to your perspective and viewpoint. People will say, “Well, that’s just one way of looking at it. There are other ways to look at it.” And while this holds true, it does not represent the truth. In other words, different viewpoints do yield different perceptions, but there is actually something beyond your viewpoint in order to see and to know.</p>
<p>你知道，当今世界普遍存在一种态度，即一切都与你的感知和看法有关。人们会说：“嗯，这只是一种看法。还有其他看法。”虽然这是事实，但它并不代表真理。换句话说，不同的观点确实会产生不同的感知，但实际上，在你的观点之外还有一些事情值得你去看见和知道。</p>
<p>This relativistic thinking then is so pervasive. It keeps people from recognizing what is essential within themselves and the world. It keeps them in a constant state of doubt and speculation about their own experience. It makes the obvious seem to be mixed in with everything else. They cannot tell what is real from what is unreal, what is genuine from what is not genuine. They think it is all their perception.</p>
<p>这种相对主义思维是如此普遍。它使人们无法认识到他们自己和世界内在的本质。它使他们对他们自己的经历不断产生怀疑和猜测。它使显而易见的事情似乎与其他一切混为一谈。他们无法分辨什么是真实的，什么是不真实的，什么是真正的，什么是虚假的。他们认为这都是他们的感知。</p>
<p>They do not realize that they need to become connected to what is happening in the world. They need to become connected to what is happening deep within themselves at the level of Knowledge. This is the foundation for relationship. This is the foundation for community. This is the foundation for being able to accomplish anything with anyone.</p>
<p>他们没有意识到，他们需要与世界上正在发生的事情建立联系。他们需要与他们自己内在内识层面发生的事情建立连接。这是关系的基础。这是社区的基础。这是能够与任何人一起完成任何事情的基础。</p>
<p>In The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, you are prepared to discover your destiny, your purpose and those key relationships that you will need to make your life fulfilling and complete here. This will take you away far beyond where you have ever gone before. In a way, what you have done before will not be what you rely upon now.</p>
<p>在大社区内识之路上，你已准备好发现你的天命、你的目的以及让你在这里的生命充实和完整所需的那些关键关系。这将带你远远超越你以前去过的地方。在某种程度上，你以前做过的事将不再是你现在所依赖的。</p>
<p>Instead, there will be a greater current pulling you forward. You will continue to have good days and bad days, days when you feel clear, days when you feel unclear, days when things are in focus, days when things are out of focus. But something will be driving you forward. It is connected to life. It is connected to the Greater Community. It is connected to who you are. They are all connected. They are all in dynamic relationship.</p>
<p>相反，会有一种更伟大的潮流拉着你前进。你将继续有好日子和坏日子，有感觉清晰的日子，有感觉不清晰的日子，有事情清晰的日子，有事情模糊的日子。但有内识会推动你前进。它与生命相连。它与大社区相连。它与你是谁相连。它们都是相连的。它们都处于动态的关系中。</p>
<p>You can experience this. You must experience this. This is calling to you. This is waiting for you. This is meant for you.</p>
<p>你可以体验这一点。你必须体验这一点。这正在召唤你。这正在等待着你。这注定属于你。</p>
<p>You have a relationship with the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. This is the greater context you will need to fully realize why you are here and what you must do. Without this context, it will not be clear to you. This is when people fill in all the gaps with their own ideas. This is when people create their ideology because they cannot see things as they really are.</p>
<p>你与世界向大社区的迈进有着某种关系。这是你需要的更伟大背景，以便充分认识到你为何在这里以及你必须做什么。没有这个背景，你不会清晰。这是人们用他们自己的想法填补所有空白的时候。这是人们创造他们的意识形态的时候，因为他们无法看清事物的本来面目。</p>
<p>Therefore, The Way of Knowledge must take you to that vantage point where you can see. In order to get up the mountain of life, you must have strong relationships, true companions who can take this journey with you. You will make it possible for each other to advance.</p>
<p>因此，内识之路必须带你到达这个你能够看见的观测点。为了登上生命之山，你必须拥有强大的关系，拥有可以与你一起踏上这段旅程的真实的同伴。你们将使彼此能够进步。</p>
<p>The journey now is before us. The Greater Community is here. Humanity must become strong. There must be greater demonstrations of relationships of Knowledge within the world. There must be more contribution. There must be greater mental and physical health. There must be preparation for the future. These are all calling to you now. Become still and you can feel it.</p>
<p>旅程现在就在我们面前。大社区就在这里。人类必须变得强大。世界上必须有更多内识关系的展示。必须有更多的贡献。必须有更伟大的身心健康。必须为未来做好准备。这些现在都在向你召唤。静下心来，你就能感觉到它。</p>
<p>I can say it in many, many different ways. I can illustrate it in many, many different ways. But it is the same calling and the same force. It is the call for Knowledge. It is the calling of Knowledge.</p>
<p>我可以用众多不同的方式来表达它。我可以用众多不同的方式来说明它。但这是同一种召唤和同一种力量。这是对内识的召唤。它是内识的召唤。</p>
<p>Stay with this. Respond to this. Keep this within your sights. Begin to prepare in The Way of Knowledge. You cannot get there without the preparation. You must take the Steps. Take these Steps and you will not journey alone, for the Unseen Ones will be with you and others will come to join you in your great journey homeward to Knowledge.</p>
<p>留在这里。对此做出回应。将其放在你的视野之内。在内识之路中开始准备。没有准备，你就无法到达那里。你必须开展内识的进阶。采取这些步骤，你将不再孤身一人，因为不可见者将与你同在，其他人也将加入你，踏上回归内识的伟大旅程。</p>
