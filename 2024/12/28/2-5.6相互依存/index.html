<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on July 4, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年7月4日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three stages in one’s overall development. There is dependence. There is independence. And there is interdependence. In the simplest way, this is demonstrated in a person’s life by the fact that they are very dependent when they are infants and young children, slowly growing out of dependence to a state of independence as an adolescent or young adult, when they begin to differentiate from their parents and family. Then there is interdependence, when they are married and have a family, or unite with other people in spiritual community and so forth.</p>
<p>人的整个发展分为三个阶段。依赖、独立和相互依存。最简单的方式是，这在人的一生中表现为，婴儿和幼儿时期依赖性很强，青少年或青年时期逐渐摆脱依赖，独立，这时他们开始与父母和家人区分开来。然后是相互依存，当他们结婚生子，或与精神社区中的其他人团结在一起等。</p>
<p>This definition really does not capture the real meaning of these three stages of development. For a person can remain dependent for their whole life—psychologically and emotionally dependent—even if they are physically able. They may pass through adolescence and young adulthood in this state. They may even marry and have a family and still be fundamentally in a state of dependence. Never having learned to think for themselves sufficiently, they just attach themselves to whomever they feel will give them stability and security. In fact, this is quite common.</p>
<p>这个定义实际上并没有抓住这三个发展阶段的真正含义。因为一个人即使身体健全，也可能终其一生都处于依赖状态——心理上和情感上都依赖他人。他们可能以这种状态度过青春期和青年期。他们甚至可能结婚生子，但从根本上来说仍然处于依赖状态。他们从未学会充分独立思考，只是依附于他们认为能给他们稳定和安全的人。事实上，这种情况很常见。</p>
<p>Within a marriage itself, these three stages can be manifested. When people first meet, they may be very dependent upon each other emotionally. They do not want to spend a day apart. When they have children, they are dependent upon each other, too, but they become more independent as their children grow. And beyond this, they may become more independent at a higher level, at a more spiritual level. But this often does not occur.</p>
<p>在婚姻中，这三个阶段可以体现出来。当人们第一次见面时，他们可能在情感上非常依赖对方。他们不想分开一天。当他们有了孩子，他们也相互依赖，但随着孩子的成长，他们会变得更加独立。除此之外，他们可能在一个更高的层面，一个更精神的层面上变得更加独立。但这往往不会发生。</p>
<p>Some people reach a state of independence, but never graduate beyond it, unable to really unite with another, to share their power with another, to yield sufficiently to another so they can work together as a team. There are many people who never really are able to move beyond this intermediate stage of independence.</p>
<p>有些人达到了独立状态，但从未超越过它，无法真正与他人团结在一起，无法与他人分享力量，无法充分屈服于他人，以便他们能够作为一个团队一起工作。许多人从未真正能够超越这个独立的中间阶段。</p>
<p>To reach a state of interdependence represents a greater level of maturity within the individual. Having attained independence sufficiently so that they can begin to think for themselves and to experience a deeper, more inner motivation that is beyond the reach of family and culture, they will find over time that they can do very little alone, and that they need to unite with others to achieve anything of real merit.</p>
<p>达到相互依存的状态代表着个人的成熟度更高。当他们获得足够的独立性，开始独立思考，体验到超越家庭和文化的更深层次、更内在的动机时，他们会随着时间的推移发现，他们独自一人几乎无法完成任何事情，他们需要与他人团结起来才能取得真正的成就。</p>
<p>In a more complete sense, this stage of interdependence represents a real union of purpose. It is not governed simply by psychological needs now or cultural mandates. It is determined by two people, or in the case of community, more people uniting for a greater purpose—a greater purpose that is theirs to fulfill. They have found one another and they have realized that together they can fulfill this purpose, whereas alone, in a more independent state, they could not.</p>
<p>从更完整的意义上讲，这一阶段的相互依存代表着一种真正的目的统一。它不再仅仅受制于现在的心理需求或文化要求。它由两个人决定，或者在社区中，由更多人为了一个更伟大的目的而团结起来——一个他们必须实现的更伟大的目的。他们找到了彼此，并意识到，他们可以一起实现这个目的，而如果独自一人，处于一个更独立的状态，他们就无法实现。</p>
<p>For you were born with a greater purpose and a mission in the world. But this mission requires the recognition and participation with certain individuals who will share this mission with you. It is their destiny to do so. Alone you have only part of the picture, and you cannot fulfill this mission alone. Knowledge, the greater Intelligence within you, knows this, of course, and will lead you, if you are free, to find those individuals with whom you can share and express and fulfill this greater purpose.</p>
<p>因为你生来就肩负着一个更伟大的目的和一个使命。但这个使命需要某些将与你共享这个使命的个体的认知和参与。这是他们的天命。你一个人只能看到一部分，你无法独自完成这个使命。内识，你内在的更伟大智能，当然知道这一点，如果你是自由的，它将引导你找到那些你可以与之分享、表达和实现这个更伟大目的的个体。</p>
<p>This represents the highest level of relationship, relationship at the level of higher purpose. Here your union is driven by a greater power and a deeper need, a need of the soul. These relationships can be so strong that they can overcome psychological impairments within the individual and differences in their personality or their cultural backgrounds. These differences will exist and can be problematic, but this greater purpose is more powerful. It reaches into the very heart of the individual.</p>
<p>这代表着最高层面上的关系，更高宗旨层面上的关系。在这里，你们的结合受到一种更伟大力量和一种更深层次需求的驱动，一种灵魂的需求。这些关系可以如此强大，以至于它们能够克服个体内在的心理障碍以及人格或文化背景的差异。这些差异将会存在，并且可能带来问题，但这种更伟大的目的更加强大。它深入个体的内心。</p>
<p>Seen from a greater perspective, your entire life is moving you towards this state of discovering you have a greater purpose, and the realization that you cannot fulfill it alone, and the realization that you cannot fill it with people who are simply pleasant or attractive. It calls for certain individuals with a deeper motivation in life and a unique set of characteristics.</p>
<p>从更伟大的角度来看，你的整个生命都在向着这样的状态前进：发现你有一个更伟大的目的，认识到你无法独自实现它，认识到你无法用那些令人愉快或有吸引力的人来填补它。它需要某些具有更深层次生命动机和一系列独特特征的人。</p>
<p>The power of Knowledge within you and the other individuals you are destined to encounter can be so strong it can lead you to find one another even if you are at opposite ends of the world. This is the highest and most complete expression of relationship, for it honors your Source and your destiny.</p>
<p>你和你注定会遇到的其他人内在的内识力量是如此强大，即使你们身处世界的两端，它也能引领你们找到彼此。这是关系的最高和最完整的表达，因为它尊重你的本源和你的天命。</p>
<p>There are people who are aware of this as a potential, but they have not cultivated their own abilities sufficiently, and they have not attained a sufficient level of independence—the intermediate stage—to be able to embark on this greater journey in life. They are moving in the right direction, but they are not ready for what they realize they must have eventually.</p>
<p>有些人察觉到这是一种潜力，但他们没有充分培养他们自己的能力，他们没有达到足够的独立水平——中间阶段——从而能够开启生命中的这个更伟大旅程。他们正在朝着正确的方向前进，但他们还没有为他们意识到他们最终必须拥有的内识做好准备。</p>
<p>For certain individuals, there is a realization even in childhood that they are here to do something important, but what it is remains a mystery. There are people who are young adults, or even in middle age, who realize they are here to do something important in life, but it remains a mystery.</p>
<p>对于某些人来说，他们甚至在童年时期就认识到他们来到这个世界上是为了做一件重要的事情，但这件事到底是什么，这仍然是个谜。有些人在青年时期，甚至在中年时期，意识到他们来到这个世界上是为了做一件重要的事情，但这仍然是个谜。</p>
<p>This is because they have not built a foundation upon which this realization can really occur, and they are not in a position yet to have this recognition and to respond to this greater calling. In certain situations, the others whom they must meet are unavailable, and so they are held back.</p>
<p>这是因为他们还没有构建一个基础，让这个认知能够真正发生，他们还没有能力拥有这个认知并回应这个更伟大的召唤。在某些情况下，他们必须遇见的人还不在，因此他们被阻碍了。</p>
<p>Perhaps they are not in the right place geographically. Perhaps they are engaged in other relationships that do not represent this higher purpose. Perhaps they have irresolution from the past that is strong enough to hold them back.</p>
<p>也许他们所处的地理位置不对。也许他们所从事的关系并不代表这个更高宗旨。也许他们过去的犹豫不决足以阻碍他们的前进。</p>
<p>In essence, they are not where they need to be. They have not reached a place where they begin a great inner transition from being governed by psychological needs to being moved by a deeper need of the soul.</p>
<p>从本质上说，他们还没有达到他们需要达到的境界。他们还没有达到一个能够开始实现内心伟大转变的地方，即从受心理需求支配转变为受灵魂更深层次需求的驱动。</p>
<p>That is why learning The Way of Knowledge is so fundamental to your preparation because Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, holds your greater purpose for you. Only it knows whom you must recognize and unite with to fulfill this greater purpose, a purpose that transcends psychological needs and cultural expectations and so forth.</p>
<p>正因为如此，学习内识之路对于你的准备是如此重要，因为内识，你内在更深层次的智能，为你保留着更伟大的目的。只有它知道你必须认识谁、与谁联合，才能实现这个更伟大的目的，这个目的超越了心理需求和文化的期望等等。</p>
<p>It is not uncommon when people begin to have this deeper realization within themselves to find that they are circumscribed by relationships and obligations and commitments that they had established previously. Perhaps they are married with a family, and now they find themselves responding to a mysterious, but powerful calling within themselves. Yet the people around them, the people to whom they are bound, are not having such an experience and are not responding to such a calling.</p>
<p>当人们开始在他们自己内心深处认识到这一点时，他们发现他们受到先前建立的关系、义务和承诺的束缚，这并不罕见。也许他们已经结婚并有了家庭，现在他们发现他们自己正在回应内心一种神秘而强大的召唤。然而他们周围的人，他们所依附的人，却没有这样的体验，也没有回应这样的召唤。</p>
<p>This creates a real crisis and a dilemma that only Knowledge itself can unravel. That is why it is necessary and so very strongly recommended that you begin to take the Steps to Knowledge when you are young. Otherwise, you will create a whole life that will then be challenged when Knowledge begins to emerge in your experience.</p>
<p>这造成了真正的危机和困境，只有内识本身才能解开。这就是为什么有必要并强烈建议你在年轻时开始开展内识的进阶。否则，当内识开始在你的体验中浮现时，你将创造出一个完整的生命，而这个生命将面临挑战。</p>
<p>For [Knowledge] will require that you re-evaluate all of your relationships—relationships with people, with places, with possessions, with goals, with all of your activities. For many people, if they have already created an entire life, this represents too great a challenge for them, even though it is natural and necessary for them to respond to this challenge.</p>
<p>因为内识将要求你重新评估你所有的关系——与人的关系、与地方的关系、与财产的关系、与目标的关系、与你所有活动的关系。对许多人来说，如果他们已经创造了整个生命，那么这对他们来说代表着一个过于巨大的挑战，尽管回应这个挑战对他们来说是自然而必要的。</p>
<p>Interdependence can be understood in many ways. It is not only interdependence with others, from a place of power and responsibility. It is interdependence with God and with those Unseen Forces in life who are working on behalf of the Creator of all life. They are depending upon you. You are depending upon them. They are communicating to you and through you, and they need you to become a representative of a greater power and presence in life. You need them because they are fulfilling your destiny. They are giving you power and strength and wisdom that you cannot provide for yourself.</p>
<p>相互依存可以从许多方面来理解。它不仅是从权力和责任的角度与他人的相互依存。它是与上帝的相互依存，与生命中那些为所有生命创造者工作的看不见的力量的相互依存。他们依靠你。你依靠他们。他们在与你沟通并通过你沟通，他们需要你成为生命中一个更伟大力量和存在的代表。你需要他们，因为他们在实现你的天命。他们给你力量、实力和智慧，而这些是你无法为你自己提供的。</p>
<p>You are giving yourself to this greater union as a conscious self-determined act. You have to function as a powerful individual here. You cannot be functioning from a state of dependence, unable to think for yourself, unable to make decisions, like a helpless child.</p>
<p>你把你自己交给这个更伟大的联盟，是一种有意识的自我决定行为。在这里，你必须作为一个强大的个体运作。你不能像一个无助的孩子一样，依赖他人，不能独立思考，不能做决定。</p>
<p>You will have to function as a powerful agent of Knowledge—a Divine representative. You will have to make strong decisions. You will have to discern your environment and your relationships. You will have to be aware and potent in your communications.</p>
<p>你必须扮演内识的强大代理人——一个代表神圣的角色。你必须做出坚定的决定。你必须辨别你的环境和关系。你必须在沟通中保持警觉和有力。</p>
<p>A relationship at this level requires powerful participants. You must have been prepared to function at this level of interdependence, or you simply cannot do it. And it will not be offered to you if you are not ready.</p>
<p>这种层面的关系需要强大的参与者。你必须准备好在这种相互依存的层面上运作，否则你根本做不到。如果你没有准备好，它就不会提供给你。</p>
<p>Here there is a natural evolution from a state of dependence where you are relying upon other people, not only to care for you physically, but to make decisions for you, to define reality for you, to guide you, to oversee your life and so forth. Many people never graduate from this condition.</p>
<p>这是从依赖状态自然演变而来的状态，你依赖他人，不仅要他们照顾你的身体，还要他们为你做决定，为你定义现实，为你指引方向，监督你的生命等等。许多人永远无法从这种状态中毕业。</p>
<p>Then there is independence where you begin to respond to your own ideas, or at least interpret your cultural conditioning as an individual. You taste the pleasures and the limitations of freedom. You have to make important decisions, take on greater ranges of responsibility, and you find that freedom is actually quite difficult, which is why many people remain in a state of dependence.</p>
<p>然后就是独立，你开始回应你自己的想法，或者至少以个体的身份解读你的文化条件。你体会到自由的乐趣和局限。你必须做出重要的决定，承担更伟大的责任，你会发现自由其实相当困难，这就是为什么许多人仍然处于依赖状态。</p>
<p>To be independent, you must be very responsible. You must assume a certain degree of authority in your life. You must manage your affairs. You must manage your thinking and behavior. You must face often difficult decisions. You make yourself vulnerable to grave errors in judgment. It is not an easy stage to be in if one is to enter it completely. But it is a necessary prerequisite to entering the greater stage of interdependence.</p>
<p>要独立，你必须非常负责任。你必须在你的生命中拥有一定程度的权威。你必须管理好你的事务。你必须管理好你的思维和行为。你必须经常面对艰难的决定。你很容易做出严重的判断错误。如果一个人要完全进入这个阶段，这不是一个容易的阶段。但这是进入相互依存的更大阶段的必要先决条件。</p>
<p>True interdependence is not simply interdependence between two individuals or interdependence with a spiritual community. Real interdependence is being guided by Knowledge and united with others at the level of Knowledge.</p>
<p>真实的相互依存不仅仅是两个个体之间的相互依存，也不是与一个精神社区的相互依存。真正的相互依存是受内识的指导，并在内识层面与他人联合。</p>
<p>This powerful recognition is so far beyond the psychological dynamics of personal relationships that it is really a new kind of experience altogether. This is where your life is meant to go. This is where every marriage is meant to go. But few people have the awareness or the understanding or the preparation necessary to engage them with the power and the presence of Knowledge in a very direct way and to prepare them to live and function at this higher level of life.</p>
<p>这种强大的认知远远超出了个人关系的心理动态，它实际上是一种全新的体验。这是你生命注定要去的地方。这是每段婚姻注定要去的地方。但是很少有人拥有必要的觉知、理解或准备，以非常直接的方式让他们接触内识的力量和存在，​​并让他们为在这个更高生命层面上生活和运作做好准备。</p>
<p>Everyone is moving in this direction because this represents the need of the soul. People have practical needs. They have psychological needs. They have even emotional needs. But the need of the soul is the deepest and most fundamental need. Life will not satisfy all of your practical needs. It will not satisfy all of your psychological needs or your emotional needs. But it is so important that life fulfills the deeper need of the soul within you.</p>
<p>每个人都在朝这个方向前进，因为这代表着灵魂的需求。人们有实际的需求。他们有心理需求。他们甚至有情感需求。但灵魂的需求是最深层次、最根本的需求。生命不会满足你所有的实际需求。它不会满足你所有的心理需求或情感需求。但生命满足你内在灵魂的更深层次的需求是如此重要。</p>
<p>This need is to discover your purpose and to fulfill it in concert with others. This ends the Separation between your thinking mind and the deeper Mind of Knowledge within you. This ends your Separation between yourself and others, for you are able to unite with certain individuals at a very complete level. This ends your Separation from God because now you are responding to the power and presence of God within your life, which is the power and presence of Knowledge in your life.</p>
<p>这种需求就是发现你的目的，并与他人一起实现它。这结束了你的思维心灵和你内在更深层次内识心灵之间的分离。这结束了你和他人之间的分离，因为你能够在一个非常完整的层面上与特定的个体结合。这结束了你与上帝的分离，因为现在你在回应你生命中上帝的力量和存在，​​这是你生命中内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>This deeper need does not mean you have no other needs, for you will still have some practical needs, psychological needs and emotional needs. But to fulfill this deeper need of the soul means that you have given satisfaction and fulfillment to your essential nature here.</p>
<p>这种更深层次的需求并不意味着你没有其他需求，因为你仍然会有一些实际需求、心理需求和情感需求。但满足灵魂的这种更深层次的需求意味着你在此给予了你关键自然的满足和充实。</p>
<p>You can acquire wealth. You can be devoted to beauty. You can be politically involved. You can have a deeply engaging social life. You can have all the appearances of success in the world. But if the deeper need of your soul remains undiscovered and unfulfilled, you will still be impoverished, and the feelings of emptiness will haunt you, driving you further into your outer pursuits as you try to mitigate or satisfy this deeper need within yourself.</p>
<p>你可以获得财富。你可以致力于美貌。你可以参与政治。你可以拥有非常投入的社交生命。你可以拥有世界上所有成功的表象。但是，如果你灵魂深处的需求仍未被发现和满足，你仍将一贫如洗，空虚的感觉将困扰你，当你试图缓解或满足你内心深处的需求时，你会进一步追求外在的事物。</p>
<p>But you cannot do it because it can only be fulfilled by responding to the power and presence of Knowledge and having it guide you to the discovery, the experience and the expression of your greater purpose.</p>
<p>但是你无法做到这一点，因为这唯有通过回应内识的力量和存在，​​并让它引导你去发现、体验和表达你的更伟大目的，才能实现。</p>
<p>For this, you will need relationships of higher purpose, relationships of destiny, for you will not be able to achieve such things on your own. And once you begin to respond to the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, once you have the strength and self-trust to do this, once you are sufficiently free from outer commitments and obligations to respond to this deeper power within yourself, you will begin to draw others to you, and some of these people will be part of your destiny.</p>
<p>为此，你将需要更高宗旨的关系，天命的关系，因为你无法独自实现这些事情。一旦你开始回应你内在内识的力量和存在，一旦你拥有力量和自信来做到这一点，一旦你充分摆脱外在的承诺和义务来回应你内在的这种更深层次的力量，你将开始吸引其他人来到你身边，其中一些人将成为你天命的组成部分。</p>
<p>If they are not ready to respond, then there will be difficulty, and they may not arrive in your life. But the power and the attraction now are becoming stronger. It represents a greater force in life, a force that is barely known to most people. But it is the force that governs the future and the advancement of humanity, and ultimately the fulfillment of everyone who has come into the world.</p>
<p>如果他们没有准备好回应，那么就会有困难，他们可能不会出现在你的生命中。但现在，这种力量和吸引力正在变得越来越强大。它代表着生命中一种更伟大的力量，一种大多数人几乎不知道的力量。但它是主导人类未来和进步的力量，最终是每个来到这个世界的人的成就的力量。</p>
<p>This is beyond your intellectual comprehension. But what is important for you now is to begin to take the Steps to Knowledge so that you can feel this power and purpose within yourself arising and so that you can adjust your life increasingly as you proceed to allow this power to emerge in your experience, to give you direction and to give you resolution. This is entirely natural. This is allowing your true nature to emerge and to express itself in your awareness and in your life.</p>
<p>这超出了你的智力理解范围。但现在对你来说重要的是开始开展内识之路，这样你就能感受到你内在的力量和目的正在升起，这样你就能随着前进不断调整你的生命，让这种力量在你的体验中浮现，给你方向，给你决心。这是完全自然的。这让你的自然浮现，并在你的觉知和生命中表达它自己。</p>
<p>This also represents interdependence within yourself, for now your body, your mind and your Spirit are working in concert with one another, whereas before your mind was slavishly trying to fulfill the needs of the body, and the body was slavishly trying to fulfill the needs of the mind, and you were preoccupied with your psychological, emotional and practical needs.</p>
<p>这也代表了你自己内在的相互依存，因为现在你的身体、你的心灵和你的精神正在协同工作，而之前你的心灵只是盲目地试图满足身体的需求，身体也盲目地试图满足心灵的需求，而你则全神贯注于你的心理、情感和实际需求。</p>
<p>Somehow your Spirit, if you were aware of it at all, was called upon to serve the mind. But now the true association of your mind, body and Spirit begins to become recognized, and you begin to learn that the body is here to serve the mind, and the mind is here to serve the Spirit, or Knowledge. Whether you believe in God or not, whether you are a religious person or not, whether you are part of a religion or not, you are beginning to experience something holy in your life.</p>
<p>在某种程度上，你的精神（如果你察觉到的话）被要求为心灵服务。但现在，你的心灵、身体和精神之间的真正联系开始被认识到，你开始了解到身体是为了服务于心灵，而心灵是为了服务于精神或内识。无论你是否相信上帝，无论你是否是一个宗教人士，无论你是否信奉宗教，你都开始在生命中体验到一些神圣的事情。</p>
<p>Anyone who becomes strong with Knowledge will attract others who are strong with Knowledge and will only really be able to participate intimately or closely with someone who is strong in Knowledge. There will be Mystery in their lives, for the intellect can never fully comprehend Knowledge. It can only follow it and serve it and receive its blessings and greatness.</p>
<p>任何拥有强大内识的人都会吸引其他拥有强大内识的人，并且只有真正能够与拥有强大内识的人亲密或紧密地​​参与其中。他们的生命将充满神秘，因为智力永远无法充分理解内识。它只能追随它、服务它并接收它的祝福和伟大。</p>
<p>But Knowledge remains ever mysterious because it is a doorway to God. It is your connection to God. It is how God speaks to you. It is where the Divine impulses enter your experience and awareness in life.</p>
<p>但内识永远是神秘的，因为它是通往上帝的大门。它是你与上帝的联接。它是上帝与你对话的方式。它是神圣的冲动进入你的生命体验和觉知的地方。</p>
<p>At another level, dependence, independence and interdependence can be understood at the level of nations. Certain nations are dependent on other nations until they gain their independence, if they ever do. Then they become independent nations, self-governing nations, nations that are exercising their self-determination.</p>
<p>在另一个层面上，依赖、独立和相互依存可以在国家层面上理解。某些国家依赖其他国家，直到它们获得独立（如果它们真的获得独立的话）。然后它们成为独立国家、自治国家、行使自决权的国家。</p>
<p>Eventually, even independent nations find themselves becoming interdependent with other nations—through trade and commerce, through the sharing of resources, through greater alliances and so forth. Ultimately, the nations of the world will have to achieve a very high state of interdependence if they are to survive the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world—environmental degradation; diminishing resources; the loss of food production; the changing climate and violent weather; the threat of pandemic illness; and the threats of growing conflict, competition and war.</p>
<p>最终，即使是独立的国家也会发现他们自己与其他国家相互依存——通过贸易和商业，通过资源共享，通过更大的联盟等等。最终，世界各国必须实现高度的相互依存，才能在即将降临世界的变革巨浪中生存下来——环境恶化；资源减少；粮食产量下降；气候变化和恶劣天气；流行病的威胁；以及日益加剧的冲突、竞争和战争的威胁。</p>
<p>Only a greater interdependence can make war unnecessary—interdependence based upon fundamental mutual need. Now it is the whole human family that must be sustained. Now it is the security of the world, even more than the security of any nation, that becomes a priority because you are threatened by the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>只有一种更伟大的相互依存才能使战争变得不必要——基于根本的相互需求的相互依存。现在必须维系的是整个人类大家庭。现在，世界的安全，甚至比任何国家的安全都更加重要，因为你们受到了变革巨浪的威胁。</p>
<p>Then there is competition from beyond the world, from the universe, from a Greater Community of intelligent life—competition seeking for dominance and persuasion within this world. This too will forge a greater unity between nations here, nations that must now depend upon one another to be sustained, to be stable and to be secure.</p>
<p>然后还有来自世界之外、来自宇宙、来自一个智能生命大社区的竞争——在这个世界里寻求统治和说服的竞争。这也将铸就这里各国之间的更伟大团结，这些国家现在必须相互依存才能持续发展、保持稳定和安全。</p>
<p>This is a destiny of nations within your world. Either they will decline through competition, conflict and war, or they will have to unite and to learn to cooperate with each other out of necessity in facing the Great Waves of change and in facing competition and intervention from a Greater Community of life in the universe.</p>
<p>这是你们世界各国的天命。它们要么通过竞争、冲突和战争衰落，要么必须团结起来，学会相互合作，以面对变革的巨浪，以面对来自宇宙生命大社区的竞争和干预。</p>
<p>This is the direction of all nations. It is resisted, of course. Nations want to remain independent, but in fact they are becoming ever more interdependent. No nation has enough resources to fully take care of itself, so its independence is short lived, in essence.</p>
<p>这是所有国家的发展方向。当然，它遭到了抵制。各国都希望保持独立，但事实上它们正变得越来越相互依存。没有一个国家有足够的资源来完全照顾它自己，所以从本质上讲，它的独立是短暂的。</p>
<p>Nations are engaged in trade. They require the sharing of resources. They require commerce, and this mitigates conflict and war and isolation. The need for interdependence between nations will grow ever more powerful and essential as time goes on in the face of the Great Waves of change and in the face of competition and intervention from the universe around you.</p>
<p>各国都在进行贸易。它们需要共享资源。它们需要商业，这减轻了冲突、战争和孤立。随着时间的推移，面对变革的巨浪，面对来自你们周围宇宙的竞争和干预，各国之间相互依存的需要将变得越来越大和必要。</p>
<p>So at the level of the individual, at the level of relationship, at the level of nations, this movement through these three stages—dependence, independence and interdependence—is the natural evolution and flow of life. If you are unable to move through these three stages, your life will be held up. Even if you are able to gain a certain degree of material success and security, you have not really fulfilled your life here. Your development has been arrested and held back. You are incomplete. Your life will be unfulfilled and unrewarding.</p>
<p>因此，在个人层面、在关系层面、在国家层面，通过这三个阶段——依赖、独立和相互依存——是生命的自然演化和流动。如果你无法通过这三个阶段，你的生命就会受到阻碍。即使你能够获得一定程度的物质成功和安全，你也没有真正实现你在此的生命。你的发展被阻止和阻碍。你是不完整的。你的生命将是不充实和没有回报的。</p>
<p>When a person is moving from the stage of dependence to independence, then independence is everything to them. They are not yet able to give themselves to anyone sufficiently or in a genuine sense. And when someone is moving from the stage of independence to interdependence, that is everything to them.</p>
<p>当一个人从依赖阶段走向独立阶段时，独立对他们来说就是一切。他们还不能充分或真正地把他们自己交给任何人。而当一个人从独立阶段走向相互依存阶段时，这对他们来说就是一切。</p>
<p>What is necessary to understand here is that relationships function at all three of these of levels—dependence, independence and interdependence. People could have a relationship of dependence, where they are just mutually dependent on each other, huddling together, afraid to be in life, afraid to assume powers and responsibilities. They are huddling together, trying to escape through romance, trying to escape through shared obsessions, trying to escape from life.</p>
<p>这里需要理解的是，关系在依赖、独立和相互依存这三个层面上运作。人们可能有一种依赖关系，他们只是相互依赖，挤在一起，害怕融入生命，害怕承担力量和责任。他们挤在一起，试图通过浪漫来逃避，试图通过共同的痴迷来逃避，试图逃避生命。</p>
<p>Then there is relationship at the level of independence, where people are together, but they are trying to still assert themselves as individuals. So there is a competition for power. There are problems dealing with authority. There are problems dealing with how much is shared and how much is still the [province] of the individual.</p>
<p>然后是独立层面的关系，人们在一起，但他们仍试图维护他们自己作为个体的地位。因此，存在权力竞争。在处理权威方面存在问题。在处理多少是共享的以及多少仍然是个人的[领域]方面存在问题。</p>
<p>Many people are in this stage, of course. They want to be together, but only to a certain degree. They are unwilling to unite with each other. It is more of a collaboration.</p>
<p>当然，许多人都处于这个阶段。他们想在一起，但只是在一定程度上。他们不愿意团结在一起。这更像是一种合作。</p>
<p>Nations are in this stage of still trying to be independent, but to benefit from relationship with one another. So there is a constant tension and struggle over power, dominance and authority.</p>
<p>各国目前仍处于试图独立但又希望从彼此关系中获益的阶段。因此，权力、统治和权威之间始终存在着紧张和斗争。</p>
<p>People who are in relationship at the level of independence are always concerned with power, authority and setting boundaries. They want to be together, but they want to be self-determined, and so they are constantly in a struggle or a tension over these matters.</p>
<p>处于独立关系的人总是关心权力、权威和设定界限。他们想在一起，但他们想自主，所以他们在这些问题上总是处于斗争或紧张之中。</p>
<p>You can see this all around you. People are together, but not really together. They are trying to fulfill their psychological and emotional needs together. Perhaps they are trying to fulfill practical needs together, to build financial security together. But at the level of the soul, they are not together. They are not even meant to be together. They do not have a greater destiny together. They are simply using each other to try to fulfill their psychological, emotional or practical needs. And so their relationships are stressful and rarely last a long time. If they do last, it is because they have property together, they have established wealth together or they are obligated to their children together, but they are not really together.</p>
<p>你可以在周围看到这种情况。人们在一起，但并非真正在一起。他们试图一起满足心理和情感需求。也许他们试图一起满足实际需求，一起建立财务安全。但在灵魂层面，他们并没有在一起。他们甚至不应该在一起。他们没有共同的更伟大天命。他们只是在利用对方，试图满足心理、情感或实际需求。因此他们的关系紧张，很少能持续很长时间。如果他们的关系能持续下去，那是因为他们共同拥有财产，共同积累财富，或者共同对他们的孩子负有义务，但他们并没有真正在一起。</p>
<p>Knowledge will liberate them, if they have the courage to face this and if they have begun to experience the deeper movement of their life.</p>
<p>如果他们有勇气面对这个问题，并且已经开始体验生命中更深层次的运动，那么内识将会解放他们。</p>
<p>Relationship at the level of interdependence is rare and very special. It can take the form of a marriage. It can take the form of working together in spiritual community. It can take the form of a great alliance in one’s work. But it has this greater dimension, this greater power and this greater stability. Individuals are still individuals. They still have their own psychological, emotional and practical needs, and many of these needs will be met through their great association. But it is the power and presence of Knowledge that is guiding them now.</p>
<p>相互依存层面的关系是罕见且非常特殊的。它可以采取婚姻的形式。它可以采取精神社区共同工作的形式。它可以采取工作中的伟大联盟的形式。但它拥有这种更伟大的维度、这种更伟大的力量和这种更伟大的稳定性。个体依然是个体。他们依然有他们自己的心理、情感和实践需求，而这些需求中的许多将通过他们的伟大联盟得到满足。但现在，正是内识的力量和存在引导着他们。</p>
<p>They have found escape from the endless negotiations that people are engaged in at the level of independence, trying to be in relationship at the level of independence. They have found resolution at this greater stage. They are motivated by a mission and calling in life. They are in service to others. Their relationship now has entered a new arena, a greater panorama. They still have problems together. They still have difficulties communicating over certain issues. They still have likes and dislikes. But there is this greater power within them that is moving them. It is coming from within them. It is not coming from any external force. They are not being manipulated.</p>
<p>他们已经摆脱了人们在独立层面上所从事的无休止的谈判，试图在独立层面上建立关系。他们已经在这个更伟大阶段找到了解决方案。他们受到生命中的使命和召唤的激励。他们服务于他人。他们的关系现在进入了一个新的领域、一个更伟大的全景。他们在一起依然有问题。他们在某些问题上依然难以沟通。他们依然有好恶。但是他们内在有一股更伟大力量在推动着他们。它来自他们的内在。它并非来自任何外在力量。他们没有被操纵。</p>
<p>Only someone who is beginning to feel the stirrings of Knowledge within themselves can appreciate and value relationships at this level. To those in earlier stages, it is rarely understood. People at the level of dependence think interdependence is just more dependence. People who are at the stage of independence are afraid of interdependence because they think it represents a loss of their personal power. They are not ready for it. They do not even see how necessary it really is.</p>
<p>只有那些开始感受到他们自己内在内识的骚动的人才能欣赏和重视这个层面的关系。对于处于早期阶段的人来说，很少有人理解这一点。处于依赖层面的人认为相互依存只是更多的依赖。处于独立阶段的人害怕相互依存，因为他们认为这代表着他们个人权力的丧失。他们还没有做好准备。他们甚至没有看到这有多么必要。</p>
<p>That is why when Knowledge begins to move in your life, and you begin to feel that you have a greater destiny here, and that this really is essential and central to your life and to the importance of your relationships and activities, you will begin to make this transition from independence to interdependence.</p>
<p>正因为如此，当内识开始在你的生命里移动，当你开始感到你在此拥有一个更伟大的天命，并且这对你的生命以及你的关系和活动的重要性来说确实是必要和核心的时候，你将开始实现从独立到相互依存的转变。</p>
<p>You will seek a greater honesty from people, a greater responsibility in people and a greater resonance with people. You are no longer driven simply by your psychological, emotional and practical needs. There is a greater need now, and it requires a much deeper and more complete level of communication and relationship with others.</p>
<p>你将寻求人们更加诚实，更加负责，与人们产生一种更伟大的共鸣。你不再仅仅被你的心理、情感和实际需求所驱动。现在有一个更伟大的需求，它需要与他人进行一种更深层次、更全面的沟通和关系。</p>
<p>If you were to follow your life consciously, you would see that there are stages, that at a certain point you will feel the yearnings to become independent, to differentiate from the social structure in which you have grown. And though many people are never able to enter this second stage of their development, it is still a natural impulse.</p>
<p>如果你有意识地回顾你的生命，你就会发现生命有多个阶段，在某个时刻，你会渴望独立，渴望摆脱你成长的社会结构。虽然许多人永远无法进入他们成长的第二阶段，但这仍然是一种自然的冲动。</p>
<p>And it is a natural impulse to realize, if you are living independently, that to have a greater purpose in life means you must have a greater degree of relationship with others. You need a greater commitment in being together and a greater resonance with one another. It is as if you have hit a point in your journey, and now something else is set in motion, as if a switch has been thrown, or you stepped over a line that has ignited a deeper movement in your life.</p>
<p>如果你独立生活，那么你自然会意识到，要想在生命中拥有更伟大的目的，就必须与他人建立更紧密的关系。你们需要更紧密地在一起，彼此之间产生一种更伟大的共鸣。这就像你在旅途中到达了某个节点，现在又有其他事情开始了，就像一个开关被打开了，或者你跨过了一条线，点燃了你生命中一种更深层次的运动。</p>
<p>The movement away from dependence and later the movement away from independence represent natural transitions, stimulated by Knowledge within you. It is also represented by meeting deeper sets of needs, as if there is a hierarchy of needs.</p>
<p>摆脱依赖和随后摆脱独立代表着自然的转变，由你内在的内识所激发。它也代表着满足更深层次的需求，就好像存在着需求的层级一样。</p>
<p>At first you need people to survive and to be safe and secure as you grow up. Then you have a need to express yourself as an individual and to determine your psychological, emotional and practical needs as an individual. And later you begin to feel there is a greater need within you—the need of the soul, the need to discern the purpose of your life, and to express this great purpose, and to find those individuals who are meant to be a part of it.</p>
<p>一开始，你需要有人陪伴才能生存，才能在成长过程中获得安全感。然后，你需要表达你自己作为个体的你，并确定你作为个体的心理、情感和实际需求。后来，你开始感觉到你内心有一种更伟大的需求——灵魂的需求，需要辨别你生命的目的，表达这个伟大的目的，并找到那些注定要成为它一部分的人。</p>
<p>These are all natural transitions. But it does not mean that people choose to move forward. So much of what people do is unnatural. People do miss the cues and signs of their life, and this is constantly happening. It takes a strong will and determination to move from dependence to independence, and you must establish this independence before you can really be prepared to enter a greater stage of interdependence.</p>
<p>这些都是自然的过渡。但这并不意味着人们选择继续前进。人们做的许多事情都是不自然的。人们确实会错过他们生命的线索和迹象，这种情况一直在发生。从依赖走向独立需要坚强的意志和决心，你必须先建立这种独立性，然后才能真正准备好进入一种更伟大的相互依存阶段。</p>
<p>Each stage is necessary. You cannot jump from dependence to interdependence, for you will never have the strength or authority within yourself to enter this third stage of your development. And to move from a stage of dependence to [independence] means you will be changing your relationships with people, with your family and with your friends. It will bring new relationships into your life. And as you move from a stage of independence to interdependence, it will change your relationship with everyone you know and bring new relationships into your life.</p>
<p>每个阶段都是必要的。你无法从依赖跳到相互依存，因为你永远没有力量或权威进入你发展的第三阶段。从依赖阶段进入独立意味着你将改变你与他人、与家人和与朋友的关系。这将为你的生命带来新的关系。当你从独立阶段进入相互依存时，它将改变你与你认识的每个人的关系，并为你的生命带来新的关系。</p>
<p>You can think of it as an ascending level of need. But really it is a natural transition because you are sent into the world with a purpose. Your intellect does not know what it is and cannot figure it out. It is beyond the realm of the mind. It is in the arena of Knowledge, or Spirit.</p>
<p>你可以把它看作是需求的上升阶段。但实际上，这是一个自然的过渡，因为你带着目的来到这个世界。你的智力不知道它是什么，也无法弄清楚。它超出了心灵的范围。它属于内识或精神的领域。</p>
<p>The mind can understand and recognize steps that must be taken in one’s life, decisions that must be made, restraints that must be exercised, boundaries that must be established and so forth. But the greater power and movement of your life is mysterious. It is deeper. It is beyond the reach of the intellect. You can create an elaborate understanding of it, but really it can never contain the reality.</p>
<p>心灵可以理解和认识到一个人一生中必须采取的步骤、必须做出的决定、必须行使的约束、必须设立的界限等等。但你生命中更伟大的力量和运动是神秘的。它是更深层次的。它超出了智力的范围。你可以对它创造一种详尽的理解，但实际上它永远无法包含现实。</p>
<p>This is the movement of your life. If you are moving from dependence to independence, you must make this transition in order for your life to progress and for you to find greater satisfaction and greater strength. If you find yourself moving from a state of independence to interdependence, you must make this transition to find greater relationships, greater strength and a deeper fulfillment and meaning in your life.</p>
<p>这是你生命的运动。如果你正在从依赖转向独立，你必须进行这种转变，这样你的生命才能进步，才能找到更大的满足感和更大的力量。如果你发现你自己正在从独立状态转向相互依存，你必须进行这种转变，才能找到更伟大的关系、更伟大的力量以及你生命中更深层次的满足感和意义。</p>
<p>Knowledge will take you there, for that is where Knowledge is going. If you cannot move with Knowledge, Knowledge remains with you, but it is silent, awaiting your readiness.</p>
<p>内识会带你去那里，因为这是内识要去的地方。如果你不能随内识而行，内识会留在你身边，但它会保持沉默，等待你的准备。</p>
<p>You have a journey to take and a destiny to fulfill here. That, in essence, is the real meaning of your life. This is what you will reflect upon once you leave this world. This is the deeper thread of truth and meaning.</p>
<p>你要踏上一段旅程，要在这里实现一个天命。从本质上讲，这就是你生命的真正意义。这就是你离开这个世界后要反思的事情。这是真理和意义的更深层次的线索。</p>
<p>The journey is before you. You must take it. Do not turn away from it for any reason—not for love, not for money, not for intellectual pride, not for personal security. This is your journey. You must take it.</p>
<p>旅程就在你面前。你必须踏上征程。不要因为任何原因而放弃它——不管是因为爱情，不管是因为金钱，不管是因为智力的骄傲，不管是因为个人安全。这是你的旅程。你必须踏上旅程。</p>
