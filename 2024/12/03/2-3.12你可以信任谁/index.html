<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 9, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年10月9日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In times of great change, many things are revealed. Weakness is revealed, corruption is revealed, incompetence is revealed—within governments and institutions and within people everywhere. In facing great change, people begin to find the real condition of their nature and constitution, and whether their foundation is strong or not.</p>
<p>在伟大变革时期，许多事情都会显露出来。弱点会显露出来，腐败会显露出来，无能会显露出来——在政府和机构内部，在各地的人民内部。面对伟大的变革，人们开始发现他们的自然和体质的真正状况，以及他们的基础是否牢固。</p>
<p>Humanity is now facing Great Waves of change that are coming to the world: environmental decline, diminishing resources, violent weather, changing climate, growing political and economic instability and the real risk of war between groups of nations over the remaining resources.</p>
<p>人类现在正面临着席卷全球的变革巨浪：环境恶化、资源减少、恶劣天气、气候不断变化、政治和经济日益的不稳定，以及各国之间为争夺剩余资源而爆发战争的实际风险。</p>
<p>The growing human family is drinking from a slowly shrinking well. The strain this will produce—the unanticipated consequences, the fracturing of economies—all of these things will be revealed as time goes on.</p>
<p>日益壮大的人类大家庭正从一口逐渐萎缩的井中汲取营养。这将带来的压力——意想不到的后果、经济的崩溃——所有这些都将随着时间的推移而显露出来。</p>
<p>People will find themselves far less secure than they perhaps believed they were before. It will change their priorities and their focus in life, and the question of trust will arise. Who can you trust? What can you trust? Can you trust yourself? Can you trust other people? Can you trust your ideas or beliefs or assumptions?</p>
<p>人们会发现他们自己的安全感远不如以前。这将改变他们的优先事项和生命重心，信任问题也随之而来。你​​可以信任谁？你可以信任什么？你可以信任你自己吗？你可以信任他人吗？你可以信任你的想法、信念或假设吗？</p>
<p>So much will be thrown in question that you may feel you cannot trust anything, that everything is in flux. What you relied upon before is now changing or breaking up or falling apart. You may feel that you cannot trust your leaders, your government, your economic institutions, your religious institutions. People may question the foundation of their religious beliefs and institutions. Peoples’ grievances towards other groups and other nations will be activated as they look for someone to blame.</p>
<p>许多事情都会受到质疑，你可能会觉得你无法信任任何事情，一切都在变化之中。你以前所依赖的事物现在正在改变、瓦解或分崩离析。你可能会觉得你无法信任你的领导人、你的政府、你的经济机构、你的宗教机构。人们可能会质疑他们的宗教信仰和机构的基础。当人们寻找可以责怪的人时，他们对其他群体和其他国家的不满情绪就会被激发。</p>
<p>You are entering into a time of great instability and uncertainty, and this will arouse many different kinds of passions, ideas and reactions in people. Most of them will be unhealthy and unfavorable. Within yourself, you will have to find a firm foundation as the foundations of society and organizations around you become challenged or fall into disarray.</p>
<p>你们正在进入一个极不稳定和不确定的时期，这将激起人们各种不同的激情、想法和反应。其中大部分都是不健康和不利的。随着你周围的社会和组织的基础受到挑战或陷入混乱，你必须在你自己的内心找到一个坚实的基础。</p>
<p>Trust here cannot be based upon hope. Hope is too weak and too easily dashed, too easily disappointed and overthrown. Your trust must be in something greater, within yourself and within other people.</p>
<p>这里的信任不能建立在希望之上。希望太过脆弱，太容易破灭，太容易令人失望和被推翻。你必须信任更伟大的内识，信任你自己和他人内在的内识。</p>
<p>As the Great Waves approach and begin to have ever-greater impacts, you will see, perhaps with dismay, that so many things you trusted in before or relied upon before will now appear to be weak and vulnerable. People will appear to be weak and vulnerable. Governments will appear to be weak and vulnerable. Even your most firmly held beliefs about your nation or your religion may appear to be weak and vulnerable. This throws you back upon yourselves and requires a re-evaluation, a very serious and deep re-evaluation.</p>
<p>随着巨浪的逼近，并开始产生越来越大的影响，你会看到，也许是惊愕地看到，你以前信任或依赖的许多事物，现在都显得软弱无力、不堪一击。人们会显得软弱和脆弱。政府将显得软弱和脆弱。就连你对国家或宗教最坚定的信念也会显得软弱和脆弱。这让你重新回到你自己，需要重新评估，非常严肃和深入的重新评估。</p>
<p>Many people have based their entire lives on a set of hopes and expectations which are built upon a weak and fragile infrastructure of human society. You will see how easily governments are thrown into panic, how easily major institutions can fail or falter. And this will shake you.</p>
<p>许多人的一生都建立在一系列希望和期望之上，而这些希望和期望又建立在人类社会脆弱不堪的基础设施之上。你将看到政府是多么容易陷入恐慌，主要机构是多么容易失败或摇摇欲坠。这将震撼你的心灵。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will want someone to blame. Perhaps you will strike out at others. Perhaps you will express anger and frustration, but this is not really addressing your core need or problem here.</p>
<p>也许你会想找个人来指责。也许你会攻击他人。也许你会表达愤怒和沮丧，但这并不能实际解决你的核心需求或问题。</p>
<p>The question arises: Who can you trust, what can you trust? Everyone will trust something. Even if it is a distrust, they will trust something. Perhaps they will trust change. They will say everything is going to change, and that is where they will place their faith and their trust. Even the most cynical point of view has trust in it. One is trusting their cynicism. One is trusting their ideas. One is trusting their perception and their position in life, even if that trust is misplaced.</p>
<p>问题出现了：你可以信任谁，你可以信任什么？每个人都会信任一些事情。即使是一种不信任，他们也会信任一些事情。也许他们会信任改变。他们会说一切都会改变，这就是他们信仰和他们信任的地方。即使是最愤世嫉俗的观点，其中也包含着信任。人们信任他们的愤世嫉俗。人们信任他们的想法。人们信任他们的感知和他们在生命中的位置，即使这种信任是错位的。</p>
<p>So the question will arise in times of great change, uncertainty and upheaval: What can you trust? Where will you place your faith? As you look about you, if you are looking seriously, if you are really looking to see and not merely to judge, it will be a difficult question to answer. What can you really trust? What is it you see that will not fall away in front of you, or prove to be weak and vulnerable or prove to be other than it appears?</p>
<p>因此，在伟大的变革、不确定性和动荡的时期，就会出现这样的问题：你可以信任什么？你的信仰又将寄托在哪里？当你环顾四周时，如果你认真地观察，如果你真的在观察而不是仅仅评判，它将是一个很难回答的问题。你真正可以信任什么？你所看到的，是什么不会在你面前崩塌，不会显示出软弱和脆弱，或被证明是表里不一的？</p>
<p>It will be a crisis of faith for people everywhere, even in the wealthy nations where hope and belief and assumption are more rife and evident than in the poorer nations, where people tend to be a little more realistic. Fantasy and self-indulgence increase with affluence, but so does disassociation from life—a disassociation from humanity, a disassociation from reality itself.</p>
<p>它对世界各地的人们来说都将是一场信仰危机，即使是在富裕的国家，那里的希望、信仰和假设比贫穷国家更为普遍和明显，因为在贫穷的国家，人们往往更为现实。幻想和自我放纵会随着富裕而增加，但与生命的脱离也随之而来——一种与人类的脱离，一种与现实本身的脱离。</p>
<p>God has created a deeper Mind within you—a Mind that is not afraid, a Mind that is not in conflict with itself, a Mind that does not judge and condemn others, a Mind that is secure, a Mind that can face great change and upheaval with determination and equanimity, a Mind called Knowledge. It is called Knowledge because it is related to your ability to have profound experiences of recognition and knowing. These experiences can fly in the face of even your own ideas and beliefs, for they are not bound by these things.</p>
<p>上帝在你的内心创造了一种更深层次的心灵——一种无所畏惧的心灵，一种不与它自己冲突的心灵，一种不评判和谴责他人的心灵，一种安全的心灵，一种能够以坚定和平静面对伟大变革和动荡的心灵，一个被称为内识的心灵。它之所以被称为内识，是因为它与你拥有深刻的认知和知道的体验的能力有关。这些体验甚至可以与你自己的想法和信念相悖，因为它们不受这些事物的束缚。</p>
<p>Your deeper Mind is so different from your intellect; from your socially-conditioned mind; from your personal mind that is patterned by culture, family and even religion; patterned to think like others, patterned to be compliant, patterned to be subject to other forces; to be persuaded and manipulated, to be corralled and cajoled, to be directed and to be pacified.</p>
<p>你更深层次的心灵与你的智力、与你受社会条件制约的心灵、与你受文化、家庭甚至宗教塑造的个人心灵有着很大的不同；你的心灵被塑造成与他人一样的思考，被塑造成顺从的模式，被塑造成受其他力量制约的模式；你的心灵被说服和操纵，被控制和哄骗，被指挥和安抚。</p>
<p>That is why people say the same things, think the same thoughts, do the same things. Like herds of cattle, they are corralled around, led to believe this, led to believe that, assured constantly by governments and leaders that their well-being is being attended to, that they will be safe and secure.</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们说着同样的话，想着同样的事，做着同样的事。就像牛群一样，他们被圈养起来，被引导着相信这个，被引导着相信那个，被政府和领导人不断地保证着他们的福祉会得到关注，他们将安全无虞。</p>
<p>But in the face of the Great Waves of change, these assurances will prove to be weak and transparent. And they will prove to be utterly false in so many instances. Then people will be outraged. They will be shocked. They will be dismayed. They will feel betrayed. They will feel misled. And they have been misled, and they have misled themselves.</p>
<p>但是，面对变革的巨浪，这些保证将被证明是软弱无力的、透明的。在许多情况下，它们将被证明是完全虚假的。到那时，人们就会愤怒。他们会感到震惊。他们会感到沮丧。他们会感到被背叛。他们会感到被误导。他们被误导了，他们也误导了他们自己。</p>
<p>Having given their authority and their power over to other forces, to other people, to governments, or to sets of beliefs and assumptions, now they feel really vulnerable. And they are less likely to trust future assurances.</p>
<p>他们将他们的权威和他们的力量交给了其他势力、其他人、政府，或者一系列信仰和假设，现在他们感到非常脆弱。并且，他们不太可能再信任未来的保证。</p>
<p>This is both dangerous and healthy. It is dangerous because people can do radical things that are not in their best interests. They can condemn others, trying to find someone to blame because they themselves cannot yet take real responsibility for their life and condition, so they must find someone else to blame. And they will give this blame with vehemence. Perhaps they will blame peoples of other nations, leading to further misunderstanding and the potential for conflict and war. This is how your personal mind responds to change—with fear, with panic, with aggravation, with condemnation, even with violence: violent thoughts, violent behavior, violent intentions.</p>
<p>这既危险又健康。它之所以危险是因为人们会做出不符合他们最佳利益的激进之举。他们会谴责他人，试图找出一个人来责怪，因为他们自己还不能对他们的生命和状况负起真正的责任，所以他们必须找一个人来责怪。他们会激烈地指责这个人。也许他们会指责其他国家的人民，导致进一步的误解和冲突与战争的可能性。这就是你的个人心灵对改变的回应——恐惧、恐慌、恼怒、谴责，甚至暴力：暴力的思想、暴力的行为、暴力的意图。</p>
<p>But your deeper Mind does not respond this way at all. It recognizes the Great Waves of change. It understands people’s lack of preparation and awareness. It sees the problem. It recognizes the manifestations of this fundamental problem that people are not connected to Knowledge within themselves, so they do not see, they do not know and as a result they do not act wisely.</p>
<p>但是，你更深层次的心灵却完全不会这样回应。它认识到变革的巨浪。它理解人们缺乏准备和觉知。它看到了问题所在。它认识到这个根本问题的表现形式，即人们没有与他们自己内在的内识相联接，因此他们看不到，他们不知道，因此，他们不会明智地行动。</p>
<p>They allow themselves to be shepherded around by people who are profiting off of them. They are given some slight degree of security and affluence perhaps, but they yield so much for this. They are willing to believe because they want to believe, because they are afraid not to believe, because they feel they do not have the power to think outside of these assurances. This is fundamentally a problem in people’s lack of awareness of Knowledge.</p>
<p>他们任由那些从他们身上牟利的人摆布。他们或许得到了一些安全感和富裕，但他们为此付出了太多。他们愿意相信，因为他们想要相信，因为他们害怕不相信，因为他们觉得他们没有能力在这些保证之外思考。从根本上说，这是人们缺乏对内识觉知的问题。</p>
<p>Would you rather have a government guide you, or a financial institution guide you, or have God guide you? Your leaders may be as blind as anyone else, living on false assumptions, believing firmly and fervently in their own ideas and the justification of their actions, like the blind leading the blind. You want to believe because you are afraid not to believe, because without that, then what can you trust?</p>
<p>你是愿意让政府指导你，还是愿意让金融机构指导你，还是愿意让上帝指导你？你的领导者可能和其他人一样盲目，生活在错误的假设中，坚定而狂热地相信他们自己的想法和他们行为的合理性，就像盲人带瞎子一样。你想要相信，因为你害怕不相信，因为如果不相信，你还可以信任什么？</p>
<p>This shock is beneficial because it gives you a chance to recognize how weak and frail is the foundation of human civilization and how prone to error all people are. And you will see that there is really something else within people—perhaps you will only see it in a few people—that is really wise.</p>
<p>这种冲击是有益的，因为它让你有机会认识到人类文明的基础是多么薄弱和脆弱，以及所有人都是多么容易犯错。你会看到，在人们的内心深处，确实存在着内识——也许你只能在少数人身上看到——真正的明智。</p>
<p>You have a natural trust towards people who demonstrate this wisdom and this compassion. These people are not perfect, of course. They can make critical errors, but there is a certain quality about them that distinguishes them from others and that naturally evokes your sense of respect and trust. Though these individuals may make mistakes, they are functioning from a higher standard. They are truly here to serve, and this transcends their self-interest in the matter. This is because you are recognizing Knowledge within them—a deeper power, a greater incentive, a truer motivation.</p>
<p>你对展现这种智慧和同情心的人有一种天然的信任。当然，这些人并不完美。他们可能会犯关键性的错误，但他们身上有一种特质使他们区别于其他人，并自然而然地唤起你的尊重和信任感。尽管这些人可能会犯错，但他们是在一种更高的标准下运作的。他们在这里是真正服务的，这超越了他们在这件事上的自我利益。这是因为你认识到了他们内在的内识——一种更深层次的力量、一种更伟大的激励、一种更真实的动机。</p>
<p>To be disillusioned and disappointed in others and in leaders of governments, commerce and religion is healthy because it requires you to reconsider your own beliefs and assumptions and to consider that there may be a deeper power within you that is far more reliable and consistent. This opens the door. It is a possibility that you will have this recognition. It is not assured.</p>
<p>对他人以及政府、商业和宗教领袖感到幻灭和失望是健康的，因为它要求你重新考虑你自己的信仰和假设，并考虑你内在可能存在一种更加可靠和一致的更深层次的力量。这打开了大门。你有可能会得到这种认知。但它并不是一定的。</p>
<p>In times of great change and upheaval, people will do very foolish things. They will hurt other people. They may even hurt themselves. But there is a chance that they will see that there is a deeper power and presence within them that is not a product of social conditioning or social patterning. It is not a product of culture, belief or tradition.</p>
<p>在伟大变革和动荡时期，人们会做出非常愚蠢的事情。他们会伤害他人。他们甚至可能会伤害他们自己。但他们有可能看到，在他们的内心深处有一种更深层次的力量和存在，​​这种力量和存在不是社会条件或社会模式化的产物。它不是文化、信仰或传统的产物。</p>
<p>Here there is something very unconventional within you—a free Mind, a Mind that is uncorrupted, a Mind that is beyond persuasion and manipulation. This is not the mind you think with every day. This is a deeper Mind.</p>
<p>在你的内心深处有一种非常规的心灵——一种自由的心灵，一种未受玷污的心灵，一种不受说服和操纵的心灵。这不是你每天思考的心灵。这是一种更深层次的心灵。</p>
<p>People say they trust themselves. Perhaps they will even declare that they will only trust themselves. But what are they really trusting within themselves—their ideas, their beliefs, their assumptions, their political views, their religious beliefs?</p>
<p>人们说他们信任他们自己。也许他们甚至会宣称他们只信任他们自己。但他们真正信任的是他们自己内心的什么——他们的想法、他们的信仰、他们的假设、他们的政治观点、他们的宗教信仰？</p>
<p>What are they referring to here? Are they going to trust their emotions, which can be so easily stoked by fear, disappointment and blame? Are they going to trust their natural instincts, which in many cases can be truly violent and destructive? What are they going to trust within themselves? What are they talking about here when people say they are going to trust themselves?</p>
<p>他们在这里指的是什么？他们会信任他们的情感吗？这种情感很容易被恐惧、失望和责备所激发？他们会信任他们的自然本能吗？这种本能在许多情况下可能是真正暴力和破坏性的？他们会信任他们自己内心的什么？当人们说他们会信任他们自己时，他们在这里谈论的是什么？</p>
<p>This can be just as foolish and illusory as putting all your faith in some kind of institution or set of government leaders whom you really do not know, because it is putting the faith in the same shallow intelligence. To believe in your own social conditioning is really no different than believing in someone else’s social conditioning. It is belief in the same thing.</p>
<p>这就像把所有的信仰寄托在你实际上并不真正知道的一种机构或一组政府领导人身上一样愚蠢和虚幻，因为这实际上是在把信仰寄托在同样浅薄的智能上。相信你自己的社会化过程，实际上与相信他人所受的社会化过程没有什么区别。它是对同一事物的信念。</p>
<p>Perhaps you feel you have more control over your social conditioning, but most people really do not. They are simply following it slavishly, and when it disappoints them, they try to place the blame outside themselves. To avoid self-recrimination, they try to blame others to find someone beyond themselves upon whom they can vent their anger and frustration.</p>
<p>也许你觉得你可以更好地控制你的社会条件，但大多数人实际上并不能。他们只是盲目地遵循它，当社会让他们失望时，他们试图将责任推到他们自己之外。为了避免自责，他们试图责怪他人，以找到他们自己以外的人来发泄他们的愤怒和沮丧。</p>
<p>To say that you trust yourself would only really be wise if you were speaking about Knowledge, but Knowledge exists beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. It cannot be understood intellectually because it is a force and a power that is more ancient and more permanent than your personal mind. It is like asking a child to understand the reality of their parents.</p>
<p>只有在谈论内识时，说你信任你自己才是真正的明智之举，但内识的存在超越了智力的领域和范围。它无法在智力上理解，因为它是一种比你的个人心灵更古老、更永恒的力量和能量。它就像是让一个孩子去理解他们父母的现实。</p>
<p>Knowledge is functioning at a different level. It is not of this world, but it is in this world to fulfill a mission, to experience and express a higher purpose. This is your mission and your higher purpose. In light of this, disappointment and radical change, no matter how difficult or stressful, can really be beneficial. If seen from the position of Knowledge, then the Great Waves of change are the perfect opportunity to express a greater purpose and to give greater gifts to humanity.</p>
<p>内识在不同的层面上运作。它不属于这个世界，但它在这个世界里是为了完成一个使命，去体验和表达一个更高宗旨。这就是你的使命和你的更高宗旨。鉴于此，失望和剧变，无论多么困难或压力重重，实际上都可以是有益的。如果从内识的位置来看，变革的巨浪是表达一个更伟大目的和给予人类更伟大礼物的完美机会。</p>
<p>Yet you look with sobriety because you understand the great risks for human suffering and loss of life here, so you do not take this casually. It is very risky. Change, if it is real, is very risky. The outcome is not assured. People may not do well or even survive. Knowledge is very sober about this. It is not casual. It is not so self-assured that it can assure the outcome, but that is not its issue or its emphasis. It is here to serve.</p>
<p>然而，你以清醒的眼光看待这一切，因为你理解这里存在着人类的痛苦和生命损失的巨大风险，所以你不会对此掉以轻心。它是非常危险的。真正的改变是非常冒险的，其结果是没有保证的。人们可能表现不佳，甚至可能无法生存。内识对此非常清醒。它不是轻率的，它并不自信到可以保证结果，但这并不是它所关注或强调的重点。它在这里是为了服务。</p>
<p>Because it is immortal, it is not afraid of death. It simply does not want to lose this opportunity to serve. After so much has been done to bring you into the world, and after so much influence has been placed in your life to keep you from making terrible mistakes, or giving your life away prematurely, or destroying your opportunity to contribute to a world in need, Knowledge definitely wants to preserve you—to preserve your mind, your thinking mind, and your body. In this regard, it will protect you and guide you with the wisdom you will not be able to find anywhere else.</p>
<p>因为它是不朽的，所以它不害怕死亡。它只是不想失去这个服务的机会。为了把你带到这个世界上，内识做了许多事情，为了不让你犯下可怕的错误，为了不让你过早地失去生命，为了不让你失去为这个需要帮助的世界做出贡献的机会，内识在你的生命中施加了许多影响，内识肯定想要保护你——保护你的心灵、你的思维心灵和你的身体。在这方面，它将保护你，并用你在其他任何地方都找不到的智慧来指导你。</p>
<p>Knowledge looks upon the world very differently. It sees the need for Knowledge. It recognizes that even in affluence, people can be betraying themselves constantly and undermining their future. It sees beyond the illusion of success and failure. It even sees beyond the illusion of love and fear because most people do not understand what love and fear really are. It sees Knowledge and the need for Knowledge in the world. It looks with compassion. It looks with wisdom. And it looks without self-deception. It sees the problem. It sees the risks. It sees the needs. It is always watching. It is not caught up in fantasy. It is not distracted. It is not carried away by promises of love and bliss and enlightenment. But it is also not terrified by the world in its brutality, suffering and degradation.</p>
<p>内识以非常不同的眼光看待世界。它看到了对内识的需求。它认识到，即使在富裕的情况下，人们也可能不断背叛他们自己并破坏他们的未来。它看透了成功和失败的幻觉。它甚至看透了爱和恐惧的幻觉，因为大多数人并不理解什么是真正的爱与恐惧。它看到了内识，以及世界对内识的需求。它带着同情去看。它带着智慧去看。它的看没有自我欺骗。它看到了问题。它看到了风险。它看到了需求。它始终在观察。它没有陷入幻想。它没有分心。它没有被爱、幸福和启蒙的承诺所迷惑。但它也不会被世界的残酷、痛苦和堕落所吓倒。</p>
<p>Your personal mind cannot think like this. You may try to purify yourself. You may give yourself over to decades of spiritual practice, but your personal mind cannot do this. It is still a product of the world.</p>
<p>你的个人心灵无法这样思考。你可以尝试净化你自己。你可以投入数十年的精神实践，但你的个人心灵无法做到这一点。它仍然是世界的产物。</p>
<p>People try to lift their intellect beyond error, beyond illusion, beyond misinterpretation, but they find they can only go so far. And then they have an experience of judgment or condemnation, fear or blame, or lust or desire, and they realize that really it is the same old mind. Perhaps they have become more objective. Perhaps they are less influenced by this personal mind, but it is the same old mind.</p>
<p>人们试图让他们的智力超越错误、超越幻觉、超越错误解释，但他们发现他们只能走这么远。然后，他们就会经历评判或谴责、恐惧或责备、欲望或渴望，然后他们就会意识到，它其实还是同样的陈旧心灵。也许他们变得更加客观。也许他们受个人心灵的影响更小了，但它还是原来的陈旧心灵。</p>
<p>Just like you cannot alter your body really without extreme actions, without mutilating yourself, you cannot really change your appearance beyond a certain point. You cannot change your personal mind beyond a certain point. What changes is your relationship with it.</p>
<p>就像你无法真正改变你的身体一样，除非采取极端的行动，除非伤害你自己（自残），你不能真的超越某种程度来改变你的外表。你也无法在一定程度上改变你的个人心灵。真正改变的是你与它的关系。</p>
<p>Instead of slavishly following your thoughts and your feelings, thinking that your mind is who you are, you begin to look at it more objectively. You see that your thinking mind—your thoughts, your beliefs, your attitudes—really is not who you are. It is an outward expression of who you are, but who you really are is something more deep, more profound.</p>
<p>你不再盲目地追随你的思想和感觉，认为你的心灵就是你，而是开始更客观地看待它。你会看到，你的思维心灵——你的思想、你的信仰、你的态度——其实并不是你。它是你是谁的外在表现，但你真正是谁却是更深层次、更深刻的内识。</p>
<p>It is like looking at the surface of the ocean—one day calm, next day turbulent, always changing, always being swept by the winds of the world. Do you look at the surface of the ocean and know the ocean? Of course not. You cannot see the life the ocean contains from the surface. Perhaps you will see the evidence of a few life forms—whales and dolphins and fishes—but you cannot see what really lives in this ocean. You cannot stand on a mountain top and look at the forest below and know everything that lives there, unless you have lived there. Do not look at the mind, at the surface, and think you understand the mind.</p>
<p>它就像看着海洋的表面——第一天风平浪静，第二天就动荡不安，总是在变化，总是被世界的风吹拂。你看着海洋的表面就能知道海洋吗？当然不能。你无法从表面看到海洋中包含的生命。也许你会看到一些生命形式的证据——鲸鱼、海豚和鱼类——但你看不到这片海洋里真正生活着的生命。除非你曾经在那里生活过，否则你不可能站在山顶上，看着下面的森林，知道那里生活的一切。不要只看到心灵的表面，就认为你理解心灵。</p>
<p>There is Knowledge deep within you. It is the deeper Mind within you, a Mind so different from your intellect that you cannot even compare them. This Mind knows. This Mind sees. This Mind waits. This Mind directs.</p>
<p>内识就在你的内心深处。它是你内心深处的更深层次的心灵，这种心灵与你的智力截然不同，你甚至无法将它们进行比较。这个心灵知道。这个心灵看见。这个心灵等待。这个心灵指引。</p>
<p>For you see, God knows the world is extremely difficult, and living in Separation is extremely hazardous. That is why God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to discover your greater purpose in the world—within the very circumstances of the world as it is and as it will be.</p>
<p>因为你看，上帝知道这个世界是极其艰难的，生活在分离中是极度危险的。正因为如此上帝把内识放置在你的内在，来指导你、保护你并引领你发现你在世界上的更伟大目的——在这个世界现在和将来的环境中。</p>
<p>You are not sent into the world to set yourself up in a state of perpetual comfort and self-assurance. You are sent into the world to work, to accomplish things, to make deep connections with others. To seek things beyond this or to think things that contravene this is a kind of self-betrayal.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界上，不是为了让你自己永远处于舒适和自我肯定的状态。你被送入这个世界是为了工作，为了完成事情，为了与他人建立深厚的联接。寻求在这一点之外的事情，或者思考与之相悖的事情，都是一种自我背叛。</p>
<p>And yet does not your culture encourage this? Does not your society value this, this self-betrayal—encouraging you to be powerful and wealthy, to have pleasure, to live in great affluence, to be admired, to be feared?</p>
<p>然而，你的文化难道不鼓励这种行为吗？你的社会难道不重视这种自我背叛吗——鼓励你追求权力与财富，享乐，过着富裕的生活，受人敬仰、令人畏惧？</p>
<p>Society’s visionaries and saints may be reduced to poverty and persecution, but oh its wealthy are idealized and held in great esteem. Those who have lost their connection to Knowledge and have given themselves over to seeking power and preference in the world, is that who you would emulate? Is that what you wish for yourself?</p>
<p>社会中的远见者和圣人可能会沦落到贫困和迫害之中，但富人却被理想化并受到高度尊重。那些失去了与内识的联接，且将他们自己交给寻求世间权力和优待的人，难道是你所希望效仿的对象吗？这就是你对你自己的期望吗？</p>
<p>Certainly, you need a certain degree of security. Basic needs must be met. You need a stable environment. You need opportunities. Yes, of course. Knowledge knows that and supports that. But really people have taken this way beyond their authentic needs.</p>
<p>当然，你需要一定程度的安全感。基本需求必须得到满足。你需要一个稳定的环境。你需要机会。这些都是必要的。内识知道这一点并支持这一点。但实际上，人们已经将这种需求超越了他们真实的需求。</p>
<p>So you have an aberrant life here, a life that is perpetually unstable, a life that is driven by fear and greed. It is a distortion, and in some cases it is an abomination. In times of great change, you realize finally you cannot trust this. Perhaps your belief in it will be shaken. Perhaps your slavish adherence to it will be shaken and thrown into question and doubt. And this is a good thing, you see.</p>
<p>因此，你在这里过着一种异常的生命，一种永远不稳定的生命，一种被恐惧和贪婪驱使的生命。它是一种扭曲，在某些情况下，它是令人憎恶的。在伟大的变革时期，你最终会意识到你无法信任这种生命。也许你对它的信念会受到动摇。也许你对它的盲目依附会动摇，并受到质疑和怀疑。你看，这是一件好事。</p>
<p>In times of seeming affluence, people are asleep. Few are questioning their condition or the validity of their lives or the meaning or value of what they are doing. But in times of disappointment, people are much more alert, much more concerned. This generates for many people a healthy self-inquiry and re-evaluation.</p>
<p>在看似富裕的时期，人们都在沉睡。很少有人会质疑他们的状况，质疑他们生命的正当性，质疑他们所做事情的意义和价值。但在失望的时候，人们会更加警觉，更加关注。这使许多人产生了健康的自我探究和重新评价。</p>
<p>If this re-evaluation is successful, it will bring you to Knowledge. If disappointment is beneficial, it will bring you to Knowledge. If self-doubt is productive, it will bring you to Knowledge. If disappointment will yield real value to you, it will bring you to Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果这种重新评估是成功的，它将带你走向内识。如果失望是有益的，它将带你走向内识。如果自我怀疑是富有成效的，它将带你走向内识。如果失望能为你带来真正的价值，它将带你走向内识。</p>
<p>You do not understand Knowledge. Perhaps you think it is weak and fleeting, a kind of romantic idea, a kind of hope or a wish. Perhaps you think it is not substantial enough to really be your foundation in life. You still value your technology. You still value your institutions and beliefs and ideas, thinking they will save you and the world.</p>
<p>你不理解内识。或许你认为它是脆弱而短暂的，是一种浪漫的想法，一种希望或愿望。或许你认为它不足以真正成为你生命的基础。你依然珍视你们的技术。你依然珍视你们的制度、信仰和理念，认为它们将拯救你和这个世界。</p>
<p>But look at the individuals who had the greatest beneficial impact on humanity over time, and you will see that they were individuals who were guided by a deeper and more pervasive power and a truer intention. And they demonstrated a greater courage and integrity. They were guided by Knowledge, just as you must be guided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>但是，看看那些随着时间的推移对人类产生最大有益影响的个体，你将看到，他们都是被一种更深层次、更普遍的力量以及一种更真实意图所引导的个人。他们展示了更伟大的勇气和完整性。他们受到内识的指导，就像你必须受到内识的指导一样。</p>
<p>How can you trust Knowledge? You barely experience it. It is not there when you want it. It does not give you what you want. It does not answer all your questions. It does not reassure you the way you want to be reassured. How can you trust this thing called Knowledge?</p>
<p>你如何可以信任内识？你几乎没有体验到它。当你想要它的时候，它并不在那儿。它不会给你你想要的东西。它不会回答你所有的问题，它不会以你想要的方式安慰你。你如何可以信任这个叫做内识的东西呢？</p>
<p>Like anything else, real trust must be based upon experience. It cannot simply be a hope or a wish or an idea. You build your trust in Knowledge by following Knowledge and seeing how it brings into your life people and situations, opportunities and insights that you would not have found otherwise.</p>
<p>像其他任何事情一样，真正的信任必须基于体验。它不能仅仅一种是希望、一个愿望或一个想法。你通过遵循内识并观察它如何将你原本无法发现的人和情况、机会和洞见带入你的生命，来建立你对内识的信任。</p>
<p>You learn to trust Knowledge because you realize that it is not fooled by the world and that somehow you had feelings or premonitions about things before they happened. You felt restraint before you made mistakes. You felt encouragement, but then did not follow it through. You chose your preferences, which are all based on fear, the fear of not having. You followed this when your deeper nature was telling you something else. You wanted to own this thing, but Knowledge within you was silent, showing no interest at all.</p>
<p>你学会信任内识，因为你意识到它不会被这个世界所愚弄，而且在事情发生之前，你不知何故对它们有一种感觉或预感。在你犯错之前，你感到一种克制。你曾感受到鼓励，但却没有跟随它。你选择了你的偏好，而这些偏好全都基于恐惧，对没有的恐惧。当你更深层次的自然告诉你另一件事时，你却遵循了这种恐惧。你想拥有这个东西，但你内在的内识却保持沉默，完全没有表现出兴趣。</p>
<p>Over time and experience in taking the Steps to Knowledge, you begin to see the very great difference between how Knowledge responds to things and how your intellect and mind respond to things, and how much energy you spend over things of little or no value or consequence, pursuing things of little or no value or consequence—your emotional rages, your outbursts of anger, your indulgences in self-pity. All these things are happening, and Knowledge is just there.</p>
<p>随着时间的流逝和在内识进阶中积累的经验，你开始看到内识对事物的回应与你的智力和心灵对事物的回应之间的巨大差异，你会看到你花费了多少能量在那些没有价值或后果的事情上，追求那些没有价值或后果的事情——比如你的暴躁情绪、愤怒的爆发、沉溺于自怜。所有这些事情正在发生，而内识就在那里。</p>
<p>You see the contrast here that your personal mind is like the surface of the ocean—always turbulent, always changing, always being thrashed about by the world and by external forces. And then there is the deeper waters, which are really moving the oceans all over the world. And there is greater life beneath the surface.</p>
<p>你在这里看到了对比，你的个人心灵就像海洋的表面——总是动荡不安，总是在变化，总是被世界和外部力量冲击。而更深层的水域，则真正推动着世界各地的海洋。在表面之下，还有更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>This contrast over time will show you beyond your doubt that there is a greater Intelligence within you that is really not functioning at the same level as your personal mind, and that you are burning up your life force in reaction to things on the outside when in reality there is a deeper awareness within you that is not really affected by these things. It is watching and waiting. It is trying to keep your life on track, to keep you from going too far off course, to restrain you from giving your life away to people, places or things before you even know what your life is.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，这种对比将毫无疑问地向你展示，你内在有一种更伟大的智能，它实际上并没有和你的个人心灵在同一个层面上运作，当你对外界事物作出反应时，你实际上正在耗费你的生命力。在现实中，你的内心深处有一种更深层次的觉知，它并不真正受这些事物的影响。它在观察和等待。它正试图保持你的生命轨迹，防止你偏离轨道太远，在你甚至还不知道你的生命是什么之前，阻止你将你的生命交给人、地方或事物。</p>
<p>How many people on their wedding day have entered the ceremony with a great feeling of inner restraint—Knowledge trying to keep them from giving their life away before they even know who they are and where they are going? How many people have capitulated to the intentions of others in this regard? The pressures of their family; the expectations of their parents; the proclamations of their religious leaders; the overall pressure of their cultures; pushing them into a life that is not really their life; pushing them to believe, to accept and to acquiesce to a set of circumstances that does not represent their real destiny and purpose in the world.</p>
<p>有多少人在婚礼当天带着一种强烈的内在克制感进入婚礼仪式——内识正试图阻止他们在知道他们是谁、要去哪里之前就交出他们的生命？有多少人在这方面屈服于他人的意图？他们家庭的压力；他们父母的期望；他们宗教领袖的宣言；他们文化的整体压力；把他们推向一种并不真正属于他们的生命；把他们推向相信、接受和默许一系列并不代表他们在世界上的真正天命和目的的情况。</p>
<p>The tragedy of this is everywhere, amongst the rich, amongst the poor, everywhere. You know what this is, for you have been subject to it as well. It is the real dilemma of your life, you see. It is the battle within yourself.</p>
<p>这种悲剧无处不在，无论是富人还是穷人。你知道这是什么，因为你也曾受其影响。你看，这就是你生命中真正的困境。这是你自己内心的一场斗争。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not fighting. It is simply going in the direction it must go. It has a destiny here in this world. It is your destiny—a destiny to meet certain people, to accomplish certain tasks.</p>
<p>内识没有进行战斗。它只是朝着它必须去的方向前进。它在这个世界上有一个天命。它是你的天命——一个与特定的人相遇、完成特定任务的天命。</p>
<p>Do not think that what you are doing now and the people you are with now represent this destiny, for in most cases, that will not be true. Do not use this as a kind of justification for your current involvements.</p>
<p>不要认为你现在所做的事情和你现在在一起的人就代表了这种天命，因为在大多数情况下，情况并非如此。也不要以此作为你当前所做所为的某种借口。</p>
<p>You may convince your mind, your thinking, your feelings because you want confirmation, because you do not want to face the fact that you have made many mistakes and errors in judgment. But you cannot persuade Knowledge. And you cannot persuade anyone else who is strong with Knowledge. They will see right through it. Just like they see right through every clever and ingenious device that people create for themselves or accept from others to try to gain advantage.</p>
<p>你可以说服你的心灵、你的思维、你的感觉，因为你想要确认，因为你不想面对你犯下的许多错误和判断失误的事实。但你无法说服内识。你也无法说服任何拥有强大内识的人。他们会一眼看穿它。就像他们看穿人们为他们自己创造的或从他人那里接受的每一个聪明而巧妙的手段，以试图获得优势。</p>
<p>This is the power of Knowledge. It cannot be fooled. And, after a while, particularly in the face of the great change, you yourself realize you do not want to be fooled. You do not want to give your life to things that have no substance, no stability, no future. You do not want to face that kind of disappointment and frustration anymore.</p>
<p>这就是内识的力量。它无法被愚弄。而且，经过一段时间，尤其是在面对伟大的变革时，你自己就会意识到你不想被愚弄。你不想把你的生命交给那些没有实质、没有稳定性、没有未来的事物。你不想再面对那种失望和挫败感。</p>
<p>Here disappointment can really serve you, to bring you to Knowledge. Here being honest about your feelings, rather than pretending to be happier than you really are, will really serve you. It is the beginning stage of liberation. To keep believing in the same things that are not real is just to recommit yourself and your life to further disappointment.</p>
<p>在这里，失望可以真正地服务于你，带你走向内识。在这里，诚实地面对你的感受，而不是假装比实际更快乐，将真正地服务于你。这是解放的开始阶段。继续相信那些不真实的事物，只会让你自己和你的生命再次陷入进一步的失望。</p>
<p>Knowledge is calling to you. It is advising you every day. It is not talking to you like your mind talks to you, like you talk to yourself. It is more like a force of attraction. It is given to certain things and not to other things. It sets a direction. It is an influence. It is a power.</p>
<p>内识正在召唤你。它每天都在为你提供建议。它的交流方式不同于你的心灵，也不同于你与你自己对话的方式。它更像是一种吸引力。它被赋予特定的事物，而不是其他事物。它设定了一个方向。它是一种影响力。它是一种力量。</p>
<p>Your mind, your thinking mind, can be talked in and out of a million things. But Knowledge just has direction. Perhaps it will say to you: “Do not do this thing. Do not say this thing. Do not commit yourself here. Follow this. Give yourself to this.” That is the extent of its conversation. It is not a little chatter box constantly talking away, trying to reassure itself, trying to be accepted, trying to impress others. It is so very different you see, refreshingly different.</p>
<p>你的心灵，你的思维心灵，可以在无数事情中进退自如。但内识只是拥有方向。它可能会对你说：“不要做这件事。不要说这件事。不要在这里承诺你自己。遵循这一点。把你自己交给这个。”这就是它的对话范围。它不是一个喋喋不休的小话匣子，它不是不停地说话，试图安慰它自己，试图被接受，试图给他人留下深刻印象。你看，它是如此的不同，令人耳目一新。</p>
<p>You were sent into the world for a purpose. Knowledge holds that purpose. Knowledge drives that purpose. Knowledge is here to keep you from giving yourself away to other things, to committing yourself prematurely, to making critical errors. It is here to guide you, but you must come to Knowledge. You must learn to abide with Knowledge, build a connection to Knowledge, take the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>你被送入这个世界是为了一个目的。内识承载着这个目的，内识推动着这个目的。内识在这里是为了阻止你把你自己交给其他事物，阻止你过早地承诺你自己，阻止你犯下重大错误。内识在这里是为了指导你，但你必须走向内识。你必须学会与内识相处，建立与内识的联接，并开展内识的进阶。</p>
<p>It is your thinking mind that must yield here. Knowledge is not here to be your little servant. You are here to serve Knowledge. That is the difference, you see, that will make all the difference in your experience and in what you will be able to see, know and do.</p>
<p>在这里，必须屈服的是你的思维心灵。内识在这里不是来做你的小仆从的。你在这里是为了服务内识。你看，这就是区别所在，这将使你的经历以及你所能看到、知道和做到的一切都与众不同。</p>
<p>At the outset, people treat Knowledge like a resource. “Well, I just want to have insights when I want them, so I’ll just go and ask Knowledge,” as if Knowledge is there as some kind of a personal counselor—a resource.</p>
<p>一开始，人们往往将内识视为一种资源。“好吧，我只是想在需要的时候得到见解，所以我会去询问内识，”仿佛内识是某种私人顾问——一种便捷的资源。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not a resource for the intellect. The intellect is a resource for Knowledge. This represents a complete shift, you see, a turning point, as if you have to get on the other side of the mountain within yourself. And that is why it is a journey and has many steps. Knowledge will not be used as a resource for your wandering desires. It just remains silent, and you will think it is not there.</p>
<p>内识并不是智力的一种资源。智力实际上是内识的一种资源。你看，这代表着一种完全的转变，一个转折点，仿佛你必须穿越内心的那座山。这就是为什么它是一段旅程，并且有许多步骤。内识不会作为你漫无目的欲望的资源而被使用。它只是保持沉默，而你会认为它根本不存在。</p>
<p>Your intentions have to come from a deeper place within you, and you have to build over time the trust that Knowledge is there, that it is powerful and wise. God is not asking you to believe this at the outset, but you must begin to build the connection to Knowledge and see that Knowledge holds your well-being, your success and your real promise, regardless of the circumstances on the outside. Those are just problems to solve.</p>
<p>你的意图必须来源于内心深处的一个更深层次的地方，并且你需要随着时间的推移建立对内识的信任，相信内识是存在的，是强大而明智的。上帝并不要求你一开始就相信这一点，但你必须开始建立与内识的联接，并看到内识持有着你的幸福、你的成功和你的真正承诺，无论外部环境如何。这些不过是待解决的问题。</p>
<p>The beginning of your journey to Knowledge will require a deep evaluation of where you are, what you are doing, who you are with, your strengths, your weaknesses, your resources, your liabilities, everything. If you are older, you will have to do this re-evaluation in a very great manner because where your life is meant to go and where it is today are not the same. So you have to reconsider everything that you are doing and consider how you got there. The teaching in The Way of Knowledge will show you how to do this evaluation in such a way that will give you wisdom and insight and not simply lead to further confusion and alienation from yourself.</p>
<p>内识之旅的开始需要你对你所处的位置、正在做的事情、你和谁在一起、你的优势、你的弱点、你的资源、你的资产、一切进行一种深入的评估。如果你上了年纪，你就必须以一种非常重大的方式进行这种重新评估，因为你生命注定要去的地方和你现在所处的地方是不一样的。所以你必须重新考虑你正在做的一切，思考你是如何到达那里的。内识之路中的教导将向你展示如何以这样的方式进行这种评估，它将赋予你智慧和洞察力，而不是简单地导致进一步的困惑和自我疏离。</p>
<p>Who and what can you trust? There are really only two choices here in reality. There is Knowledge, and there is everything else—Knowledge within you, Knowledge within others. The choices are simple but require a very deep discernment to recognize on a daily basis. It is this discernment you must cultivate and you will cultivate as you see the contrast between Knowledge within yourself and all the gyrations of your personal mind.</p>
<p>你可以信任谁？你可以信任什么？实际上，在现实中只有两种选择。一种是内识，另一种是其他一切——你内在的内识，他人内在的内识。选择是简单的，但需要一种非常深刻的辨别力才能在日常生活中认识到。你必须培养的正是这种辨别力，而你也会随着看到你自己内在的内识与个人心灵的种种波动之间的对比而逐渐培养出这种辨别力。</p>
<p>Then you will see what is really trustworthy. Then you will see what must serve. You will see the power. You will see that the mind and the body are vehicles for Knowledge to express itself in the world. And you will see that Knowledge represents your true Self, your deeper nature and the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>到那时，你将看到内识是真正值得信赖的。到那时，你将看到心灵必须服务于内识。你将看到力量。你将看到，心灵和身体是内识在世界中表达它自身的载体。你将看到，内识代表了你的真实自我、你更深层次的自然以及你生命中的更深层次的潮流。</p>
