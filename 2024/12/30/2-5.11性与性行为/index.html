<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 4, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008年1月4日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important that We address the issue of sex and sexual relationships. This is such an important part of the human experience and such an area of confusion and misappropriation that it must be addressed as a significant part of any approach to living a more meaningful and more powerful life.</p>
<p>我们必须解决性和性关系问题。这是人类经历中如此重要的一部分，也是一个容易引起混淆和滥用的领域，因此必须将其作为任何过上更有意义、更有力量生活方式的重要组成部分来加以重视。</p>
<p>Human sexuality is a potent force, and it is an appropriate one for certain people within certain circumstances. It is something that is greatly misunderstood, something around which much misunderstanding has been cast, something that must be clarified if you are to begin the great journey of discovering Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence that the Creator of all life has given you, and if you are to follow this Knowledge and to learn to express it and to render its gifts into the world, which is your purpose.</p>
<p>人类的性欲是一种强大的力量，它适合某些人在某些情况下使用。性被严重误解，人们对此产生许多错误理解，如果你要开始探索内识的伟大旅程，探索所有生命的创造者赋予你的更深刻次的智能，如果你要遵循这个内识，学习表达它，将它的礼物呈现给世界，这就是你的目的，那么就必须澄清这种误解。</p>
<p>Sexuality really is something very simple to understand. It represents both a biological need and a need for union with another. However, it must be seen within its correct context and for its true purpose to be understood.</p>
<p>性欲其实是一件很容易理解的事情。它既代表着生理需求，也代表着与他人结合的需求。然而，必须放在正确的背景下看待性欲，才能理解其真实的目的。</p>
<p>First of all, it is important to realize that sexuality is not necessary for everyone. Your sexual impulses are really not physical in nature. They represent the deeper needs of the mind, which can be fulfilled in other ways. This has been understood over the centuries, of course, by certain individuals within every faith tradition.</p>
<p>首先，重要的是要认识到性并不是每个人都需要的。你的性冲动实际上不是生理性的。它们代表了更深层次的心灵需求，可以通过其他方式得到满足。当然，几个世纪以来，每个信仰传统中的某些人都理解了这一点。</p>
<p>But again, the pure Messages that God has sent into the world have been obscured, their boundaries lost—overlaid now with interpretation, with culture and with the dictates of governments to such a point where it can become very difficult to ascertain the true meaning of God’s original Messages and the essential practices that they require.</p>
<p>但是，上帝发送给世界的纯粹讯息已被模糊，它们的界限已经消失——如今已被解读、被文化、被政府的指令所覆盖，以至于很难确定上帝原始讯息的真正含义以及它们所要求的基本实践。</p>
<p>Everyone will feel the need for union. Everyone will feel what could be experienced as a sexual drive or desire. But the origins of this are deeper than the physical mechanism of your body and can be expressed in many different ways, not only through sexual union with another.</p>
<p>每个人都会感受到结合的需求。每个人都会感受到性冲动或性欲。但这种欲望的根源比你身体的生理机制更深，可以用许多不同的方式表达，而不仅仅是通过与他人的性结合。</p>
<p>Next, it is essential that you realize that sexuality has only two purposes. It is to experience union with one whom you are truly aligned with, one that you have committed yourself to, one who represents a true partner for you in life. And secondarily, it is to produce offspring.</p>
<p>其次，你必须意识到性只有两个目的。它是为了体验与一个你真正认同的人结合，一个你承诺过的人，一个代表你生命中真正伴侣的人。其次，它是为了生育后代。</p>
<p>This definition should be clearly understood. It is not ambiguous. It is really not open for exceptions. If you get creative with the truth, the truth will abide with you no longer. And you will be left with your creations, but not with the truth itself.</p>
<p>这个定义应该被清楚地理解。它不是模棱两可的。它确实不容例外。如果你对真理进行创意加工，真理将不再与你同在。你将只剩下你的创意，而不是真理本身。</p>
<p>Sexuality is really only appropriate within a deeply committed relationship, and it should be a part of that relationship that is not established really at the outset. It is important, for you and for your well-being, to see if another person is going in the same direction you are going; if you have the necessary compatibilities to actually function successfully together in the world; to understand another’s temperament, another’s inclinations, another’s history and background and so forth before you become sexually engaged.</p>
<p>性只有在一段深爱的关系中才是合适的，而且性应该是这段关系的一部分，而不是一开始就确定的。对于你和你的幸福来说，重要的是看看另一个人是否和你走在同一个方向；你们是否有必要的兼容性来真正成功地在世界上共处；在你们发生性关系之前，理解对方的脾气、倾向、历史和背景等等。</p>
<p>Premature sexual engagement is the cause of a great deal of failure in relationship and a great deal of human suffering as well. It should really come much later, weeks and months later, until a real relationship can be established. For the relationship will really not be based on sexuality. It will be based on true compatibility and true purpose in life. It will be a union of souls, not simply a joining of bodies.</p>
<p>过早的性行为是造成人际关系失败和人类痛苦的根源。它应该在更晚的时候发生，几周甚至几个月后，直到建立一种真正的关系。因为这种关系实际上不是基于性。它将基于生命中真实的兼容性和真实的目的。它将是灵魂的结合，而不仅仅是身体的结合。</p>
<p>People make this mistake all the time and pay a very heavy cost for it. For to sexually engage with someone who does not represent your true partner in life is to violate your integrity. It is to commit yourself inappropriately. It is to try to bond yourself unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>人们总是会犯这种错误，并为此付出沉重的代价。因为与一个不代表你真实生命伴侣的人发生性关系就是违背你的完整性。它是不恰当的承诺。它是试图与你自己建立不成功的纽带。</p>
<p>All of these lead to failure and suffering. Even if sexuality is considered to be some form of recreation, in fact and in truth, it represents a bonding. And if you try to bond with someone you cannot unite with, it will be a failure. And you will experience a loss around it.</p>
<p>所有这些都会导致失败和痛苦。即使性被认为是某种形式的娱乐，但事实和真理是，它代表着一种纽带。如果你试图与一个你无法结合的人建立纽带，它将是一种失败。你会因此而感到失落。</p>
<p>Once you have become sexually engaged with someone, you have established at least the attempt at union. And your relationship will never be the same. You could never be casual friends after this.</p>
<p>一旦你与某人发生性关系，你至少已经尝试过结合。你们的关系将永远不同。此后，你们再也不能成为普通朋友了。</p>
<p>There will always be this bond that failed. There will always be this discomfort and embarrassment. There will always be a sense of apprehension.</p>
<p>这段关系永远都会破裂。永远都会有这种不适和尴尬。永远都会有一种忧虑的感觉。</p>
<p>Sexuality is a very powerful force within you. If you misapply it, it will cost you greatly. If you endeavor to engage with another inappropriately or prematurely, it will create great difficulty in your learning about another person and determining whether that person can unite with you in a meaningful way in this life.</p>
<p>性是你内在的一股非常强大的力量。如果你误用了它，你将付出巨大代价。如果你试图以不恰当或过早的方式与他人交往，这将给你了解他人以及确定此人是否能以有意义的方式与你结合带来巨大困难。</p>
<p>This is a fundamental reality. You can argue against it. You can rebel against it. You can insist that it be otherwise. But you cannot change its truth. Many have tried to find exception to this and have only found failure and disassociation from others as a result.</p>
<p>这是一个基本现实。你可以反驳它。你可以反抗它。你可以坚持认为事实并非如此。但你无法改变它的真理。许多人试图找到例外，结果却以失败告终，与他人疏远。</p>
<p>In certain places in the world, even still, and certainly within human history, men have tried to have many women. But this is like a man owning a herd of cattle. There is no true union here. There is not a uniting of souls.</p>
<p>即使在世界上某些地方，甚至在人类历史上，男人也试图拥有许多女人。但这就像一个男人拥有一群牛一样。这里没有真正的团结。没有灵魂的统一。</p>
<p>People ask, “Well, is monogamy necessary?” and We say, “Yes, of course it is.” If you try to find exception to this, it will create confusion, division and disassociation and will destroy trust and recognition between you and your partner. Again, many people have tried to take exception to this, but without good results.</p>
<p>人们会问：“好吧，一夫一妻制有必要吗？”我们会说：“当然有必要。”如果你试图对此提出异议，就会造成混乱、分裂和分离，并会破坏你和伴侣之间的信任和认知。同样，许多人也曾试图对此提出异议，但没有取得好的结果。</p>
<p>If you engage sexually with other people in a casual or recreational manner, you will dissipate your vital energy. You will spend your life force. You will lose touch with Knowledge within yourself. You will lose your sense of yourself. You will lose your sense of your self-worth and the value of your life.</p>
<p>如果你以随意或娱乐的方式与他人发生性关系，你就会耗费你的生命力。你会消耗你的生命力。你会失去与你自己内在内识的联系。你会失去对你自己的感觉。你会失去对自我价值和生命价值的感觉。</p>
<p>Most people would not simply throw all their money away, putting it in the trash, but that is exactly what you are doing when you become sexually engaged with the wrong people. It is like taking all your money and putting it into the trash, or throwing it in a fire. You are spending your wealth on nothing and will have nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>大多数人不会简单地把所有的钱都扔掉，扔进垃圾桶，但当你与错误的人发生性关系时，你所做的就是这么做。它就像把你所有的钱都扔进垃圾桶，或者扔进火里。你把你的财富花在了无用的事物上，却一无所获。</p>
<p>You must see that every pleasure has a cost. Healthy pleasures have a very small cost, perhaps even imperceptible. But other pleasures have great costs and lasting costs.</p>
<p>你必须看到，每一种快乐都是有代价的。健康的快乐代价很小，甚至可能微不足道。但其他快乐的代价却很大，而且是持久的。</p>
<p>Some of them will cost you your whole life. Some of them will cost you your future and your destiny. Some of them will cost you your health. Some of them will cost you your marriage. Some of them will cost you your relationship with your children.</p>
<p>有些事情会让你失去整个生命。有些事情会让你失去未来和天命。有些事情会让你失去健康。有些事情会让你失去婚姻。有些事情会让你失去与孩子的关系。</p>
<p>All of these pleasures that carry great costs will cost you your connection with Knowledge within yourself, setting you further into [the] darkness of your own confusion and fearful imagination, lowering your value to yourself and to other people.</p>
<p>所有这些带有巨大代价的快乐，将耗费你和你内在内识的联接，让你进一步陷入你自己困惑和恐惧想象的黑暗里，降低你对你自己以及对他人的价值。</p>
<p>If you look at people around you who have a lot of sexual engagements, you will see how unvital they are. You will see how little direction they really have. You will see what it will cost them in terms of time and energy, and their resources and their focus in life, and the amount of dishonesty it will create within them as they try to justify their behavior—to try to justify the great cost, to try to justify the great loss that they are experiencing.</p>
<p>如果你看看你周围那些有很多性行为的人，你会看到他们是多么没有活力。你会看到他们实际上是多么缺乏方向感。你会看到这会在时间和能量方面，在资源和生命焦点方面给他们带来多大的代价，以及这会在他们内在产生多少不诚实，因为他们试图为他们的行为辩解——试图为他们正在经历的巨大代价辩解，试图为他们正在经历的巨大损失辩解。</p>
<p>Your life is not about sexuality. Just like your life is not about food. Your life is not about bathing yourself. These all represent authentic needs; some of them are mandatory, of course, and some are not.</p>
<p>你的生命不关乎性。就像你的生命不关乎食物一样。你的生命不关乎洗澡。这些都代表了真实的需求；当然，有些是强制性的，有些则不是。</p>
<p>Your purpose for coming into the world is not represented by these things alone. To live for them is to live without the great purpose that God has given to you and has provided for you and placed deep within you within your Knowledge—to guide you and to protect you and to lead you to the fulfillment of your purpose here.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界的目的不仅仅由这些事情代表的。为这些事情而活，就等于没有上帝赋予你、为你提供、放置在你内心深处内识中的伟大目的而活——指引你、保护你、引领你实现在这里的目的。</p>
<p>Sexuality is a power. It must be managed correctly. You cannot simply succumb to it whenever it arises, or it will undermine your sense of health, your sense of power, your sense of purpose and your sense of integrity. You must manage it. You must restrain it and find other ways to express the deeper need that it represents. Until you can do this, you will not understand what sexuality is or how it can possibly be beneficial to you.</p>
<p>性欲是一种力量。它必须得到正确的管理。你不能一出现就屈服于它，否则它会破坏你的健康感、你的力量感、你的目的感和你的完整感。你必须管理它。你必须克制它，找到其他方式来表达它所代表的更深层次的需求。除非你能做到这一点，否则你不会理解性欲是什么，也不会理解它如何可能对你有益。</p>
<p>It is a real pleasure with the right person, but without the proper context in engagement, it carries an immense cost. There are people around you who have already spent their life force on it and have nothing to show. They leave behind them a whole series of relationships that have been disappointed, a whole series of people who are resentful and uninspired.</p>
<p>和对的人在一起确实是一种享受，但如果没有合适的环境，就会付出巨大的代价。你身边有些人已经把生命力花在了这件事上，却一无所获。他们留下了一系列令人失望的关系，一系列心怀怨恨、毫无灵感的人。</p>
<p>If you use another for sexuality, you are hurting them. You are violating them. You are hurting them. You are degrading them and yourself.</p>
<p>如果你利用他人进行性行为，你就是在伤害他们。你正在侵犯他们。你正在伤害他们。你正在贬低他们和你自己。</p>
<p>Sexuality has a real value within a relationship representing higher purpose in life, but only certain relationships, not all relationships. Between a man and a wife, if they are united at this higher level, then, yes, of course. It is an important opportunity for them to experience the depth and value of their relationship. But between those who have gathered to carry on a greater purpose in the world, it is usually not appropriate within that context.</p>
<p>在代表生命更高宗旨的关系中，性具有一种真正的价值，但仅限于特定关系，而不是所有关系。如果一对夫妻在这个更高的层面上团结一致，那么当然可以。这是他们体验关系深度和价值的重要机会。但对于那些聚集在一起实现生命中更伟大目的的人来说，在这种情况下，性通常是不合适的。</p>
<p>It is because meaning is so lacking for people that they give so much meaning to littler things. It is because people do not have meaning in their lives that they suffer and that they obsess themselves with smaller things.</p>
<p>正是因为人们缺乏意义，他们才会为琐碎的事情赋予太多意义。正是因为人们的生命缺乏意义，他们才会痛苦，才会沉迷于琐碎的事情。</p>
<p>If you are to be sexually united with someone, you must find that person, and you must take time to see if they really can unite with you. But even before this happens, you must gain a connection to Knowledge within yourself. You must build the foundation for experiencing and discovering the greater purpose that has brought you into the world. If sexuality precedes this, it ends up replacing it as an emphasis and a focus.</p>
<p>如果你要和某人发生性关系，你必须找到那个人，你必须花时间去看看他们是否真的能和你结合。但即使在这发生之前，你必须获得与你内在内识的联接。你必须构建基础，以体验和发现将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的。如果性先于这一点，它最终会取代内识成为一种强调和焦点。</p>
<p>Your most primary relationship is your relationship with God, and your relationship with God is represented by your connection to Knowledge within you. For this is the Wisdom that God has placed within you—a Wisdom that you cannot change, that you cannot alter, that you cannot bargain with, that you cannot manipulate.</p>
<p>你最主要的关系是你和上帝的关系，你和上帝的关系体现在你和你内在内识的联接上。因为这是上帝放置在你内在的智慧——一个你无法改变、无法篡改、无法讨价还价、无法操控的智慧。</p>
<p>You can only receive it and follow it and carry out what it gives you to do with as little interference as possible. If you do this and can carry this out over time, there will be no confusion about sexuality.</p>
<p>你只能接纳它、遵循它，并尽可能少地干预它给你做的事情。如果你这样做，并能长期坚持下去，就不会对性产生困惑。</p>
<p>You will not give your life away to someone. You will not spend your precious life force. You will not commit yourself to situations that have no future and no promise. You will not be seduced and swayed by the passions or the persuasions of others. You will not be manipulated by how the culture you live in manipulates people’s sexual interest and orientation.</p>
<p>你不会将你的生命交给他人。你不会浪费你宝贵的生命力。你不会将你自己投入没有未来、没有希望的境地。你不会被他人的激情或劝说所诱惑和左右。你不会被你所生活的文化如何操纵人们的性兴趣和性取向所操纵。</p>
<p>You will have a kind of freedom that very few people around you experience—a freedom to think clearly, a freedom to see, a freedom to know, a freedom to make really wise decisions, a freedom that very few people in the world today can claim and experience.</p>
<p>你将拥有一种周围很少有人体验到的自由——一种清晰思考的自由，一种看见的自由，一种知道的自由，一种做出真正明智决定的自由，一种当今世界上很少有人能够宣称和体验到的自由。</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step is to build your connection to Knowledge, to take the Steps to Knowledge, for only Knowledge within you knows who you need to be with, and how you need to be with them, and what your relationship is for, and how you should participate, and where you should give yourself. Here you must exercise patience, a rare and precious commodity.</p>
<p>因此，第一步是建立你和内识的联接，开展内识进阶，因为只有你内在的内识知道你需要和谁在一起，你需要如何和他们在一起，你的关系是为了什么，你应该如何参与，你应该把你自己交给哪里。在这里，你必须锻炼耐心，这是一种罕见而珍贵的商品。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will not have this experience with someone for another ten years. What will you do in the interim? Will you get married? Will you have affairs? Will you fall in and out of love? Will you waste your life because you cannot wait, because you have no trust, because you think you must have this union, this experience, this ecstasy right away? You cannot wait?</p>
<p>也许你还要再过十年才会和某人有这样的经历。在这期间你会做什么？你会结婚吗？你会有外遇吗？你会陷入爱情又分手吗？你会因为无法等待、因为没有信任、因为认为你必须马上拥有这种结合、这种经历、这种狂喜而浪费生命吗？你无法等待？</p>
<p>Sexuality is not a drug. It is an opportunity, but it is only an opportunity within a certain context—within the context of a real relationship, a united relationship, a relationship between a man and a wife, or between two people who have committed their life together in such a way that sexuality would be appropriate for them.</p>
<p>性不是毒品。它是一种机会，但这只是在特定背景下的机会——在一种真正的关系，一种团结的关系，一种丈夫和妻子之间的关系，或两个人之间的性行为，而这两个人已经共同承诺了生命，性行为对他们来说是合适的。</p>
<p>Very few people have this kind of relationship today, and yet everyone is trying to have sex, or looking for sex, or having sex at immense cost.</p>
<p>如今，很少有人拥有这种关系，但每个人都在尝试发生性关系，或寻找性关系，或以巨大的代价发生性关系。</p>
<p>If you look into the world and say, “Well, there are so many important things that have to be done!” Where will the commitment come to do this? Where will the human energy and ingenuity come for this? How will humanity face the Great Waves of change that are coming in a world of declining resources and violent weather, in a world where food is diminishing, in a world where people are facing ever greater plights and difficulties? Where will the energy come to meet these great challenges?</p>
<p>如果你看向世界并说：“好吧，有如此多重要的事情要做！”那么，实现这些的承诺从何而来？实现这些的人类能量和聪明才智从何而来？在一个资源减少和恶劣天气的世界里，在一个粮食减少的世界里，在一个人们面临越来越巨大困境和困难的世界里，人类将如何面对正在来临的变革巨浪？应对这些伟大挑战的能量从何而来？</p>
<p>It will not come if people are wasting themselves, trying to have sex with other people, trying to have relationship before they even know who they are or where they are going in life, trying to commit themselves before they even have any sense that there is a greater Knowledge within them?</p>
<p>如果人们浪费他们自己，试图与他人发生性关系，在他们甚至不知道他们是谁或他们在生命中要去哪里之前就试图建立关系，在他们甚至没有感觉到他们内心有更伟大的内识之前就试图做出承诺，那么这一切都不会实现吗？</p>
<p>Look at the cost. Look at the human expense. Look at the obsession and the preoccupation here.</p>
<p>看看成本。看看人类付出的代价。看看这里的痴迷和专注。</p>
<p>Human assets are being spent so unwisely, and people have very little power, very little purpose, very little direction, very little inner certainty, very little clarity in their lives and very little capacity to deal with the great uncertainties that are coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>人类的资产被如此不明智地使用，人们几乎没有力量、没有目的、没有方向、没有内心的确定性、没有对生命的清晰认识，也没有什么能力来应对地平线上即将出现的巨大不确定性。</p>
<p>Part of this is because they are misappropriating their lives. They are seeking pleasure and running away from pain, and that is why they are lost. And in certain places in the world these pursuits are encouraged. They are encouraged even in children.</p>
<p>部分原因是他们滥用了他们的生命。他们追求快乐，逃避痛苦，这就是他们迷失的原因。而在世界上的某些地方，这些追求是受到鼓励的。甚至在儿童中也是如此。</p>
<p>This is a great tragedy for humanity. It represents a fundamental corruption of the human spirit and a corruption of the value of each person.</p>
<p>这是人类的一大悲剧，它代表了人类精神的根本堕落，以及每个人价值观的堕落。</p>
<p>If you want to experience the real value of sexuality, and if that is appropriate given your purpose in life, and the form and structure of your life, then you must wait.</p>
<p>如果你想体验性的真正价值，并且如果这适合你的生命目的以及生命形式和结构，那么你必须等待。</p>
<p>First, you need the direction that only Knowledge can give, and you must travel in your true direction to gain a sense of it, to become stable within it and to break free of the bonds and the chains and the obligations that hold you back or that distract you or that carry you away.</p>
<p>首先，你需要只有内识才能给予的方向，你必须沿着你真实的方向前行，才能感受到它，在其中变得稳定，并摆脱那些阻碍你、分散你注意力或带你走的束缚、枷锁和义务。</p>
<p>That is building a foundation for your life. That is building clarity about where you must go. That is learning through time what does not work for you, what is not right for you, what you must learn to avoid.</p>
<p>这是在为你的生命打下基础。这是在明确你必须去往何方。这就是通过时间来学习什么对你不起作用，什么不适合你，什么是你必须学会避免的。</p>
<p>In many places in the world, there is this great emphasis on falling in love. You want to have this ecstatic experience with someone. You want to abandon yourself. You want to have ecstasy, falling in love.</p>
<p>世界上很多地方都十分重视坠入爱河。你想和某人一起体验这种狂喜。你想放弃你自己。你想在坠入爱河时获得狂喜。</p>
<p>But falling in love is not authentic unless it contains a deeper recognition of another. And a deeper recognition of another does not mean that you have, or will have, a real relationship with that person.</p>
<p>但是，除非对另一个人有一种更深层次的认知，否则爱是不真实的。而对另一个人更深层次的认知并不意味着你已经或将要与对方建立一种真正的关系。</p>
<p>In life, you may have a true recognition with scores of people. You cannot marry them all. And if you try to become sexually engaged with them all, you will waste your life and destroy the value of these relationships. There must be true recognition and there must be true relationship, and true relationship takes time to develop.</p>
<p>在生命中，你可能与许多人有一种真实的认知。你不可能和他们所有人结婚。如果你试图和他们所有人发生性关系，你会浪费你的生命并摧毁这些关系的价值。必须有真实的认知，必须有真实的关系，而真实的关系需要时间来发展。</p>
<p>But even here you must prepare yourself, for you do not yet know what your life is about. You have not gained enough strength in Knowledge within yourself. You are still too much a slave to other forces to have this clarity and to maintain this clarity in the face of all of the attractions and the tragedies of the world around you.</p>
<p>但即便如此，你也必须做好准备，因为你还不知道你的生命是什么。你还没有在内在的内识中获得足够的力量。你仍然过于受制于其他力量，无法拥有这种清晰，也无法在面对周围世界的所有诱惑和悲剧时保持这种清晰。</p>
<p>Do not think you are ready, for only Knowledge within you knows if you are ready. If you are ready and a true partner is not there, you are not yet ready. You can think what you like, but this does not change the reality of your condition.</p>
<p>不要认为你已经准备好了，因为只有你内在的内识知道你是否准备好了。如果你已经准备好了，而真实的伙伴却不在，那你就还没准备好。你可以想你喜欢的，但这并不能改变你的现实状况。</p>
<p>To experience relationship in the way that We are describing it here requires that you build your foundation in Knowledge, that you take the Steps to Knowledge, that you place your relationship with Knowledge above all other relationships, that you make it a priority and a central focus of your life because it is the central focus of your life.</p>
<p>为了以我们在此描述的方式体验关系，要求你在内识中建立你的基础，要求你开展内识进阶，要求你把你和内识的关系置于所有其他关系之上，要求你把它作为优先事项和你生命的中心焦点，因为内识是你生命的中心焦点。</p>
<p>If God sent you into the world to do certain things, to associate with certain people, to carry out certain activities in service to humanity and to life here, then what are you doing fooling around with people? What are you doing fooling around with your passions and your impulses? What are you doing wasting your life going in and out of relationships with people that do not share your destiny, or who cannot unite with you, for whatever reason it is?</p>
<p>如果上帝派你来到世界上做特定的事情，与特定的人交往，开展特定的活动以服务人类和这里的生命，那么你为什么要和人们鬼混呢？你为什么要和你的激情和你的冲动鬼混呢？你为什么要浪费你的生命去和那些不与你共享天命、或因为任何原因无法与你结合的人建立关系呢？</p>
<p>To build a sexual bond with another is powerful. You do not yet realize how strong it really is and what a great cost it carries and the significance it has.</p>
<p>与另一个人建立一种性纽带是非常强大的。你还没有意识到它到底有多强大，它要付出多大的代价，它的意义有多么显著。</p>
<p>If you do not discern who to be with, then at the level of your body, you will try to unite completely. The body is simply following you here. It is in service to the mind, even if the mind thinks it is in service to the body.</p>
<p>如果你没有分辨出与谁在一起，那么在你的身体层面，你就会试图完全结合在一起。身体只是在这里跟随你。它是在为心灵服务，即使心灵认为它是在为身体服务。</p>
<p>If you are alone and not within a greater relationship, and you feel sexual desire, well, it is the presence of Knowledge. Feel the Presence. It is an opportunity to experience the Presence that is your real and deeper life, to experience the Presence of your Teachers, who were sent to guide and to assist you.</p>
<p>如果你孤身一人，没有处于更伟大的关系中，而你感到性欲，好吧，这就是内识的存在。感受这种存在。这是你体验存在的机会，它是你真实而深刻的生命，是你体验老师存在的机会，他们被派来指导和帮助你。</p>
<p>But people think it is all about sex. They have to go out and have sex with someone. They need to have sex, when in fact they are experiencing the Presence. They are misinterpreting the impulse. They are misreading the signs.</p>
<p>但人们认为这全都与性有关。他们必须出去和某人发生性关系。他们需要发生性关系，而事实上他们正在体验这种存在。他们错误解释了这种冲动。他们错误阅读了这些迹象。</p>
<p>Now people will say, “Well, does this mean I have to be alone forever?” We say, “Of course not.” You are meant to be united with others, but your union must be true, and it must be based upon a greater purpose. It cannot simply be an escape from loneliness. It cannot simply be a desperate attempt.</p>
<p>现在人们会说：“好吧，这是否意味着我必须永远孤独？”我们说：“当然不是。”你注定要和他人团结在一起，但你的团结必须是真实的，它必须基于一个更伟大目的。它不能只是一种对孤独的逃避。它不能只是一种绝望的尝试。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you will take you to the right people, even if they are on the other side of the world. It will, through its power and mystery, take you to the right people to know. It will help you find your true teachers. It will help you find your true companions. And if you are to be in marriage, or to be united in that way, it will help you find your true partner. That does not mean that these other people will be ready for you. But you cannot be responsible for that. You can only prepare yourself and your life.</p>
<p>你内在的内识会带你找到合适的人，即使他们在世界的另一端。通过它的力量和神秘，它会带你找到正确的人。它会帮助你找到你真实的老师。它会帮助你找到你真实的同伴。如果你要结婚，或者以这种方式结合，它会帮助你找到你真实的伴侣。这并不意味着其他人会为你做好准备。但你不能为此负责。你只能为你自己和你的生命做好准备。</p>
<p>If you are prepared and they are not, then your relationship cannot be consummated, and that is too bad. That is really unfortunate. But what can you do? It is not your responsibility to change someone else to fit your needs. That is not your responsibility, and you are foolish to attempt it.</p>
<p>如果你准备好了而对方没有，那么你们的关系就无法圆满，这太糟糕了。这真的很不幸。但你能做什么呢？改变他人来满足你的需求不是你的责任。这不是你的责任，你试图这么做是愚蠢的。</p>
<p>People make this mistake all the time in thinking they are going to reform their prospective partner. Yet all they will do is spend their life force on something that they cannot control, on something they should not try to control. You cannot shape another to fit your deeper needs.</p>
<p>人们总是犯这样的错误，认为他们可以改造他们未来的伴侣。然而他们所做的只是把生命力花在他们无法控制的事情上，花在他们不应该试图控制的事情上。你无法塑造另一个人来满足你更深层次的需求。</p>
<p>They are either correct for that or they are not. You are either compatible enough to be in relationship together or you are not. You, and they, are either ready or you are not.</p>
<p>他们要么说得对，要么说得不对。你们要么足够合得来在一起，要么就不合适。你和他们要么都准备好了，要么还没准备好。</p>
<p>All this struggling to be in relationship, all this working on your relationship, all this negotiating with another to be in relationship…If a relationship requires that much work, it just does not work, and you must accept this. Give up the attempt. If it does not work, it does not work. What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p>为了维持一段关系而奋斗，为了维持一段关系而努力，为了维持一段关系而与他人协商……如果一段关系需要付出如此多的努力，那它就是行不通的，你必须接受这一点。放弃尝试。如果行不通，那就行不通。你打算怎么做呢？</p>
<p>Here again there is so much misapplication, so many futile attempts, so many reckless endeavors, so many hopeless pursuits. And it is all because people have not built their foundation in Knowledge and have not learned to follow Knowledge and have not taken the Steps to Knowledge and the steps that Knowledge will provide for them.</p>
<p>这里再次存在着如此多的错误应用、如此多的徒劳尝试、如此多的鲁莽努力、如此多的无望追求。这全是因为人们没有在内识中建立他们的基础、没有学会遵循内识、没有开展内识进阶以及内识将为他们提供的步骤。</p>
<p>They are afraid of losing, so they want to have everything right now. Fear is the motivation here. All the desires of the mind are based upon fear, the fear of not having. You want it now because you are afraid you will not have it in the future. You want it now because you are afraid it will never happen for you. It is all based upon fear, driven by fear, all this compulsion, driven by fear. “I must be in a relationship. I must have sexuality. I must be with someone.” It is all driven by fear.</p>
<p>他们害怕失去，所以他们想现在就拥有一切。恐惧是动机。心灵的所有欲望都基于恐惧，害怕没有。你现在想要它，因为你害怕将来得不到它。你现在想要它，因为你害怕它永远不会发生在你身上。这一切都基于恐惧，由恐惧驱动，所有这些冲动，由恐惧驱动。“我必须处于一段关系中。我必须有性生活。我必须和某人在一起。”这一切都是由恐惧驱动的。</p>
<p>Can you see the fear in that? Can you see that a person has not yet built their own foundation, they have no inner certainty, so they are trying to fill the void with someone else? They are trying to use sexuality and relationship to fill the emptiness they feel in their own life.</p>
<p>你能看出其中的恐惧吗？你可以看出一个人还没有建立他们自己的基础，他们内心没有确定性，所以他们试图用他人来填补空虚吗？他们试图用性和关系来填补他们在他们自己生命中感受到的空虚。</p>
<p>Better to face the emptiness, better to discover the power of Knowledge within you. This always comes first, you see. Without this, you are only guessing. You are living your life recklessly. You are gambling, with everything stacked against you. You may think you are brave and courageous, but really you are being very foolish.</p>
<p>最好直面空虚，最好发现你内在的内识力量。你看，这总是第一位的。没有内识，你只是在猜测。你的生命生活在鲁莽之中。你在赌博，一切都对你不利。你可能认为你是勇敢的，但实际上你是愚蠢的。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you cannot be persuaded. It cannot be altered. You cannot make it want what you want. You cannot make it believe what you believe because it is not your creation.</p>
<p>你内在的内识是无法被说服的。它无法被改变。你无法让它想要你想要的东西。你无法让它相信你所相信的事物，因为它不是你的创造。</p>
<p>You may think you are creating your reality, but you have not created Knowledge. It will show no interest in the things that are consuming you. It will not participate in your feverish desires, or your strong compulsions, or your driving needs. It simply remains silent, waiting for you to come to your senses, waiting for you to settle down, waiting for you to stop your desperate seeking and searching.</p>
<p>你可能认为你正在创造你的现实，但你并没有创造内识。内识不会对那些消耗你的事物表现出任何兴趣。内识不会参与你狂热的欲望、强烈的冲动或驱动你的需求。内识只是保持沉默，等待你恢复理智，等待你安定下来，等待你停止绝望的寻求和探索。</p>
<p>It has somewhere to take you. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed it does. But it knows where it is going, and if you are trying to go somewhere else, well, it just will not go with you. It has become silent and dormant within you. It has not disappeared. It has not abandoned you, but you have abandoned it for a while. For a day, for a month, for a year, for a lifetime, well…It is so sad, you see.</p>
<p>它要带你去一个地方。哦，是的。哦，是的，它确实有。但它知道你要去哪里，如果你想去别的地方，那么，它就不会跟你走。它已经在你的内心变得沉默和沉睡。它并没有消失。它并没有抛弃你，但你抛弃了它一段时间。一天，一个月，一年，一生，好吧……这太可悲了，你看。</p>
<p>If you seek to find your true purpose in life and your real gifts that you have been sent into the world to give, then only Knowledge can reveal these to you, and you must patiently follow it. You do not know what the journey is. You do not know what climbing this mountain is like, for you have never been on this mountain before.</p>
<p>如果你寻求找到你生命中的真实目的和你被派到这个世界去给予的真正礼物，那么只有内识能够向你揭示这些，你必须耐心地追随它。你不知道旅程是什么。你不知道攀登这座山是什么感觉，因为你从未登上过这座山。</p>
<p>You can have your spiritual ideas, you can have your concepts of a spiritual journey, you can have your concept of a return to God, you can have your concepts about righteousness and spiritual advancement and mastery and all these things, but those are only creations of the mind.</p>
<p>你可以有你的精神想法，你可以有你的精神之旅的概念，你可以有你回归上帝的概念，你可以有你关于正义、精神进步和掌握以及所有这些事情的概念，但这些只是心灵的创造。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge knows, and only Knowledge can take you there. And the fewer distractions you have, the more that you can feel the pull of Knowledge, the calling of Knowledge, the deeper power and presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>只有内识知道，也只有内识能带你到达那里。你的干扰越少，你就越能感受到内识的牵引、内识的召唤、内识更深层次的力量和存在。</p>
<p>It is not fooled by what fools you. It is not swayed by what sways you. It is not terrified by what terrifies you. It does not adhere to your religious beliefs and admonitions. It does not conform to religious institutions, or religious edicts, or nationalistic passions, or tribal impulses.</p>
<p>它不会被愚弄你的事情所愚弄。它不会被动摇你的事情所动摇。它不会被令你恐惧的事情所恐惧。它不会遵循你的宗教信仰和教导。它不会遵从宗教机构、宗教法令、民族主义激情或部落冲动。</p>
<p>That is why it is your freedom. That is why it is your integrity. That is why it is the only reliable thing within you, the only thing within you that is really trustworthy.</p>
<p>这就是为什么它是你的自由。这就是为什么它是你的完整性。这就是为什么它是你内心唯一可靠的声音，你内心唯一真正值得信赖的关系。</p>
<p>You come to Knowledge at the beginning because you realize you need it—that without it you are lost, that you are gambling your life, that you are desperately searching and seeking, that you cannot tell what is right from wrong, you cannot tell what is true from what is untrue. Driven by passion, driven by need, driven by fear, driven by your social conditioning, driven by the expectation of others, driven because you are a slave to other forces. You come to Knowledge humbly, with your hands open because you realize it is your fundamental need.</p>
<p>你来到内识面前，是因为你开始意识到你需要它——没有它，你就会迷失方向，你正在拿你的生命做赌注，你在拼命地寻找和寻求，你无法分辨什么是对什么是错，你无法分辨什么是真什么是假。被激情驱使，被需求驱使，被恐惧驱使，被你的社会条件驱使，被他人的期望驱使，因为你是其他力量的奴隶。你谦逊地来到内识面前，张开双手，因为你意识到这是你的根本需求。</p>
<p>First, you must receive before you can give. First, you must receive Knowledge and follow Knowledge before you can give what Knowledge will give through you. You cannot control the process. You cannot control and determine the journey, but you will have to control your mind and your impulses.</p>
<p>首先，你必须先收到，然后才能给予。首先，你必须先接受内识并遵循内识，然后才能给予内识将通过你给予的礼物。你无法控制这个过程。你无法控制和决定旅程，但你必须控制你的心灵和你的冲动。</p>
<p>You will have to learn to become discreet and discerning. You will have to refrain from following the dictates and expectations of others, the social agenda of your culture. You will have to refrain from being judgmental and condemning. You will have to choose based on a deeper inclination within yourself, and you must become quiet and present to feel this inclination. If you are living at the surface of your mind, you will not feel it.</p>
<p>你必须学会​​谨慎和明辨是非。你必须克制你自己，不去听从他人的命令和期望，不去听从你所在文化的社会议程。你必须克制你自己，不去评判和谴责。你必须根据你自己内心更深层次的倾向做出选择，你必须安静下来，在场，才能感受到这种倾向。如果你生活在心灵的表面，你就不会感觉到它。</p>
<p>Your mind is like the ocean. At the surface, it is being whipped about by the waves of the world, the winds of the world. It is subject to the unpredictable nature of the weather. It is driven, it is chaotic, it is still, it is turbulent, it is unpredictable.</p>
<p>你的心灵就像海洋。在表面，它被世界的海浪、世界的风吹拂着。它受制于天气的不可预测性。它是被驱动的，它是混乱的，它是静止的，它是动荡的，它是不可预测的。</p>
<p>But deeper down, the ocean currents are moving, unaffected by the winds that are whipping the surface. They are moving in a deeper direction, pulled by greater forces, governed by greater forces.</p>
<p>但在更深的海底，洋流在移动，不受海面上呼啸的风的影响。它们被更大的力量牵引着，受更大的力量主导，朝着一种更深层次的方向运动。</p>
<p>You are living at the surface, trying to navigate the surface, but you do not yet feel the deeper forces that are the real movement of your life. For this, you must learn to be still. You must learn to be observant. You must learn to see that your mind is a restless instrument. It is not who you really are. You must learn to observe it and gain the strength to direct it. And this direction must come from a deeper understanding and a deeper connection within yourself, a connection with Knowledge.</p>
<p>你生活在表面，试图在表面航行，但你尚未感受到作为你生命真正运动的更深层次的力量。为此，你必须学会​​保持静止。你必须学会​​观察。你必须学会​​看到你的心灵是一个不安分的工具。它不是真正的你。你必须学会​​观察它并获得指导它的力量。而这个指导必须来自你内在的一种更深层次的理解和一种更深层次的联接，一种与内识的联接。</p>
<p>The control you will have to exert will be a control over your thoughts and your behavior, a control over your reactions to other people because you cannot simply be governed by outside forces to the extent that you were previously.</p>
<p>你必须施加的控制是对你心灵和行为的控制，控制你对他人的反应，因为你不能再像以前那样简单地受外部力量的支配。</p>
<p>It will take time to build your connection to Knowledge. It will take many opportunities to experience it and to choose with it and to choose against it. It is not immediately recognizable. You may think you know what it is. You may fervently believe you know what it is. But you do not yet know what it is.</p>
<p>建立你与内识的联接需要时间。你需要很多机会去体验它，选择与它合作，选择与它对抗。它不是立刻就能被认知的。你或许认为你知道它是什么。你或许热切地相信你知道它是什么。但是你还不知道它是什么。</p>
<p>The mind can only follow. It cannot define. It cannot control. It cannot govern Knowledge. It can only yield and become a responsible participant. For your mind is really a vehicle of communication in the world. That is what it really is.</p>
<p>心灵只能跟随。它无法定义。它无法控制。它无法支配内识。它只能屈服并成为一个负责任的参与者。因为你的心灵实际上是世界上沟通的载体。这才是它的真正意义。</p>
<p>You think it is who you are. You think your thoughts and your feelings and your ideas represent and define who you are, but that is not who you are. If that were who you are, you would truly be pathetic and very powerless in the world.</p>
<p>你认为心灵就是你。你认为你的思想，你的感受和你的想法代表着你并定义着你，但这并不是你。如果这就是你，你在这个世界上真的会很可悲，很无能为力。</p>
<p>This is one of the great lessons that the New Message from God is here to reinforce. It is not a new idea. It has been presented before. It has been practiced by many over time. But it is something that very few people in the world will understand. It is a very liberating awareness.</p>
<p>这是来自上帝的新讯息所要强调的伟大课程之一。这不是一个新的想法。它以前就被提出过。长期以来，许多人都在实践它。但世界上很少有人能理解它。它是一种非常解放的觉知。</p>
<p>Your body and your mind are vehicles of communication and expression in this world. They must follow what Spirit, or Knowledge within you, is determining. Spirit will not follow them. The body serves the mind, the mind serves the Spirit, the Spirit serves God. That is the true hierarchy of your Being. That is the real meaning of power within your existence.</p>
<p>你的身体和你的心灵是这个世界上沟通和表达的载体。它们必须遵循你内在的精神或内识所决定的。精神不会跟随它们。身体服务于心灵，心灵服务于精神，精神服务于上帝。这就是你存在的真实层级。这才是你存在中力量的真正意义。</p>
<p>But that is all confused right now. Your mind is following your body, and you think the Spirit is serving your mind, and you want God to serve your mind as well. What the mind wants, what the mind believes, what the mind requires, what the mind admonishes, what the mind insists upon—you want God to validate that.</p>
<p>但现在这一切都是混乱的。你的心灵在跟随你的身体，你认为精神在服务你的心灵，你也希望上帝服务你的心灵。心灵想要什么，心灵相信什么，心灵需要什么，心灵告诫什么，心灵坚持什么——你希望上帝证实这些。</p>
<p>There is no bargaining here. Knowledge lives within you. You cannot change it. You can determine whether it can arise within your mind. You can determine whether it will express itself in your life. You have a real choice in this matter. You can decide whether you will experience it, whether you will follow it and whether you will carry out what it gives you to do. In this, you have a real choice in the matter, and a fundamental and consequential choice at that.</p>
<p>这里没有讨价还价。内识存在于你的内在。你无法改变它。你可以决定它是否会在你的心灵中出现。你可以决定它是否会在你的生命中表达它自己。你在这件事上有一个真正的选择。你可以决定你是否会体验它，你是否会遵循它，你是否会执行它让你做的事情。在这一点上，你在这件事上有一个真正的选择，而且是一个根本的、重要的选择。</p>
<p>But beyond that, you cannot control it. You think you are going to create your reality. Well, that is just trying to play God. That is just trying to think your mind can do what only Knowledge can do.</p>
<p>但除此之外，你无法控制它。你认为你将创造你的现实。好吧，这只是试图扮演上帝。这只是试图认为你的心灵可以做只有内识才能做的事情。</p>
<p>Your mind is a wonderful instrument of communication, a fabulous mechanism, marvelous in what it can do. It is wonderful at inventing and fixing things. It is really a great creation, but it is not who you are. And what it tells you is the truth is only a guess, an approximation.</p>
<p>你的心灵是一个奇妙的沟通工具，一个神奇的机制，它能做的事情令人惊叹。它善于发明和修复事物。它确实是一个伟大的创造，但它不是你。它告诉你的真理只是一个猜测，一个近似值。</p>
<p>You see, here you do not give your life over to God. “Here God, have my life. I will just worship you.” That does not work. God is not going to micromanage your life.</p>
<p>你看，在这里，你并没有把你的生命交给上帝。“上帝，给你我的生命。我只崇拜你” 这是行不通的。上帝不会对你的生命进行微观管理。</p>
<p>God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you. You have to become responsible in following it. You have to become responsible for your mind. You have to become responsible for your health and your well-being and your relationships and your self-expression. You have to be responsible for these things, you see. You cannot give it to God. “Well, I’ll just give it to God.”</p>
<p>上帝已经将内识放置在你的内心深处来指导你。你必须负责任地遵循它。你必须对你的心灵负责。你必须对你的健康、你的幸福、你的关系和你的自我表达负责。你必须对这些事情负责，你看。你不能把它交给上帝。“好吧，我就把它交给上帝吧。”</p>
<p>There will be no response to that, you see. What you will do is you will simply give yourself over to your mind which will create an idea of God, and you will try to serve that idea of God. Or you will adopt that idea of God from your culture or your religion, and you will try to serve that idea of God, but still, you are not being responsible.</p>
<p>你看，对此不会有任何回应。你所做的就是简单地让你自己沉浸在你的心灵中，它会创造一个关于上帝的想法，你会试图服务于这个关于上帝的想法。或者你会从你的文化或宗教中吸收这个关于上帝的想法。你会试图服务于这个关于上帝的想法，但你仍然没有负责任。</p>
<p>God does not need to be worshipped. God does not need to be praised. To honor God is to honor what God has placed within you. It is to recognize Knowledge. It is to call for Knowledge. It is to follow Knowledge. And it is to learn how to express what Knowledge is here to express through you and your life.</p>
<p>上帝不需要被崇拜。上帝不需要被赞美。尊重上帝就是尊重上帝放置在你内在的内识。尊重就是认知内识。尊重就是呼唤内识。尊重就是追随内识。尊重就是学习如何表达内识在此通过你和你的生命所要表达的目的。</p>
<p>That is how you honor God. That is how you validate and remember your relationship with God. That is how you realize that you are a vehicle for God’s love and expression in the world.</p>
<p>这就是你尊敬上帝的方式。这就是你确认和记住你与上帝的关系的方式。这就是你认识到你是上帝之爱的载体和在世间表达的方式。</p>
<p>That is where you gain the correct relationship with your mind and your body. That is where you gain the power to use sexuality appropriately, to recognize the impulse for union and to express that appropriately in your life, given your circumstances, given your own personal nature and design.</p>
<p>正是在这里，你获得了与你的心灵和你的身体建立正确关系的能力。正是在这里，你获得了适当使用性的能力，认识到结合的冲动，并根据你的环境、根据你自己的个人自然和设计，在你的生命中适当地表达它。</p>
<p>To attain what We are presenting here represents a real revolution within you. You cannot simply put on a hat and say, “I am the king.” You cannot simply put on the crown and say, “I am the king.” You cannot simply cup your hands together in prayer and say, “I am a saint.” You cannot simply say, “I believe in following Knowledge,” and be following Knowledge.</p>
<p>实现我们在此所呈现的代表着你内心的一场真正的革命。你不能简单地戴上一顶帽子说：“我是国王。”你不能简单地戴上王冠说：“我是国王。”你不能简单地双手合十祈祷说：“我是圣人。”你不能简单地说：“我相信追随内识”，然后就追随内识。</p>
<p>This is a journey. This is a revolution. This is shifting the true source of your authority from your mind to the power of Knowledge within you. This is changing your relationship with your mind. This is changing your relationship with your thoughts. This is changing your relationship with your body. This is changing your relationship with other people. This is changing your priorities, your emphasis, your focus, your goals—everything, you see.</p>
<p>这是一段旅程。这是一场革命。这正在把你权威的真正来源从你的心灵转移到你内在内识的力量。这正在改变你和你心灵的关系。这正在改变你和你思想的关系。这正在改变你和你身体的关系。这正在改变你和其他人的关系。这正在改变你的优先次序、你的重点、你的焦点、你的目标——你看，一切。</p>
<p>Before, your life was not about Knowledge. It was all governed by social conditioning and your chaotic desires. To shift from that to being an inner-directed person, to be a person whose life is brought into unity and focus, whose thoughts and priorities are not in contradiction with one another, who has moved through confusion, who has gained a greater wisdom, a greater capacity, a greater strength—this requires a real revolution.</p>
<p>以前，你的生命与内识无关。一切都受制于社会条件和你混乱的欲望。要想从这种状态转变为一个由内在导向的人，要成为一个生命统一而专注的人，要成为一个思想和优先事项不相互矛盾的人，要成为一个走出困惑的人，要成为一个获得更伟大智慧、更伟大能力、更伟大力量的人——这需要一场真正的革命。</p>
<p>That is why the Steps to Knowledge are many. That is why this is a journey and not simply some kind of personality makeover. You are not simply redecorating your jail cell here and calling it liberation. This is not cosmetic. This is fundamental.</p>
<p>这就是为什么通往内识的阶梯如此之多。这就是为什么这是一段旅程，而不仅仅是一种人格改造。你不是简单地重新装饰你的牢房，然后称之为解放。这不是表面文章。这是根本。</p>
<p>To begin this journey, you cannot be wasting your life on sexuality and relationships in situations that have no promise and no future. You have to begin to conserve your energy, to redirect your energy, to redirect your time, your thoughts, your resources.</p>
<p>要开始这段旅程，你不能把你的生命浪费在没有希望和没有未来的性和关系上。你必须开始保存你的能量，重新调整你的能量，重新调整你的时间、你的思想、你的资源。</p>
<p>You have to prepare for a world undergoing the Great Waves of change. My God, that will consume so much of your time and energy right there. You have to become a student of Knowledge and take the Steps to Knowledge. That will consume your time and energy right there.</p>
<p>你必须为一个正在经历巨变的世界做好准备。天哪，这会消耗你大量的时间和能量。你必须成为一名内识学生，并开展内识进阶。这会消耗你的时间和能量。</p>
<p>You have to begin to dig out of the hole that you have dug for yourself. You have to begin to repair your life, to regain your sense of yourself, to rebuild your integrity, to re-establish your self-honesty, to reorient yourself in your relationships, to become someone who is inner directed and not simply a slave to other forces.</p>
<p>你必须开始从你自己挖的坑里爬出来。你必须开始修复你的生命，重新找回自我意识，重建你的完整性，重新树立你的诚实，重新定位你的关系，成为一个由内在导向的人，而不是简单地成为其他力量的奴隶。</p>
<p>You need a lot of time and energy to do all this while you maintain yourself in the world, while you work, while you develop your health, the Four Pillars of your life: your health, your relationships, your work and your spiritual development, which is your journey to Knowledge. You cannot be fooling around and have the time to do all these things.</p>
<p>你需要大量的时间和能量来做所有这些事情，同时你还要在这个世界上维持你自己，同时你还要工作，同时你还要发展你的健康，你生命的四大支柱：你的健康、你的关系、你的工作和你的精神发展，也就是你的内识之旅。你不可能一边胡闹一边有时间做所有这些事情。</p>
<p>You have to get serious about your life. The clock is ticking. The world is changing. Your time is being used up. You cannot get it back. This is the time for you. This is the hour. This is where you must find your true direction and find the truth that will take you there, the truth that only Knowledge within you has.</p>
<p>你必须认真对待你的生命。时钟在滴答作响。世界在变化。你的时间正在被用完。你无法挽回。这是属于你的时间。就是现在。这是你必须找到你真实的方向并找到将带你到达那里的真理的地方，只有你内在的内识才拥有的真理。</p>
<p>This will rescue you from a life of mediocrity, a life of personal failure, a life of obsession, a life of addiction, a life of meaningless pursuits, a life without meaning, a life without purpose, a life without resounding value. This will give you escape from all that because only Knowledge knows how to take you out of the predicament you have created for yourself and that you have allowed to be created in your life.</p>
<p>这将把你从一种平庸的生命，一种个人失败的生命，一种痴迷的生命，一种上瘾的生命，一种无意义追求的生命，一种没有意义的生命，一种没有目的的生命，一种没有响亮价值的生命中拯救出来。这将让你摆脱所有这些，因为只有内识知道如何把你带出你为你自己创造的困境，以及你允许在你的生命中创造的困境。</p>
<p>You may think your situation cannot be resolved, but God resolves everything because God calls you out. God calls you out of your predicament. God calls you out of your state of mind. God calls you into a greater awareness and a greater service in the world.</p>
<p>你可能认为你的情况无法解决，但上帝会解决一切问题，因为上帝会召唤你。上帝会召唤你走出困境。上帝会召唤你走出你心灵状态。上帝会召唤你进入一种更伟大的觉知，为世界做出更伟大贡献。</p>
<p>Even if you are poor, even if you have very little, even if you are facing tremendous difficulties and adversities, there is the power and the pull of God within you, the power and the pull of Knowledge.</p>
<p>即使你是贫穷的，即使你拥有的很少，即使你面临着巨大的困难和逆境，你内心仍然有上帝的力量和吸引力，有内识的力量和吸引力。</p>
<p>This applies to everyone. To the person who is hungry, it gives them food. To the person who needs shelter, it gives them shelter. To the person who needs clothes, it gives them clothes. To the person who needs reassurance, it gives them reassurance. To the person who needs security, it gives them security. Beyond that, meeting those fundamental needs, the great gift is the gift of Knowledge.</p>
<p>这适用于所有人。对于饥饿的人，它给他们食物。对于需要庇护的人，它给他们庇护。对于需要衣服的人，它给他们衣服。对于需要安慰的人，它给他们安慰。对于需要安全感的人，它给他们安全感。除此之外，满足这些基本需求，最伟大的礼物就是内识的礼物。</p>
<p>The New Message from God has been sent into the world to clarify this, for it has been lost and forgotten to the vast majority of people. And the need for it is great. It is immense. It is fundamental.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息被发送到这个世界以澄清这一点，因为它已经被绝大多数人所遗忘。而它的需求是伟大的。它是巨大的。它是根本性的。</p>
<p>Humanity will not make it in the future without the power of Knowledge resonant within enough people. And that is why there is a New Message from God in the world.</p>
<p>如果内识的力量无法在足够多的人心中产生共鸣，人类就无法在未来取得成功。这就是为什么世界上有来自上帝的新讯息。</p>
<p>Humanity will not survive and advance if it struggles and fights over the remaining resources. That is why there is a New Message from God in the world.</p>
<p>如果人类为了剩余的资源而争斗，人类将无法生存和进步。这就是为什么世界上有来自上帝的新讯息。</p>
<p>This is not just for you and for your redemption and fulfillment. This is for the world. You have come for the world. You have come to provide assistance and service in a very specific way. Only Knowledge knows what that is, where that can happen, who that can happen with, under what circumstances and for what purpose.</p>
<p>这不只是为了你、为了你的救赎和成就。这是为了世界。你是为了世界而来。你是为了以一种非常特殊的方式提供帮助和服务而来。只有内识知道它是什么，它可能发生在哪里，它可能发生在谁身上，在什么情况下以及为了什么目的。</p>
<p>If you can allow that to be a mystery in your life, then you can proceed. For there is so much work for you to do, just to repair and refocus your life, just to prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming, just to get your life in order, just to get your mind in order. Certainly, this is enough work for you.</p>
<p>如果你能允许这成为你生命中的一个谜，那么你就可以继续前进。因为你有太多的工作要做，只是为了修复和重新聚焦你的生命，只是为了为即将到来的变革巨浪做好准备，只是为了让你的生命井然有序，只是为了让你的心灵井然有序。当然，这些工作对你来说已经足够了。</p>
<p>Let Knowledge do what only Knowledge can do. But you must do your part. This is not for the passive or the complacent, for the lazy and the indigent.</p>
<p>让内识去做只有内识才能做的事。但你必须尽你的一份力量。这不适合被动或自满的人，不适合懒惰和贫困的人。</p>
<p>You must become stronger than you are today, more focused than you are today, more honest than you are today, more forgiving than you are today, more resilient than you are today. You will do your part, and Knowledge will do its part, and this will redeem you.</p>
<p>你必须变得比现在更强大，比现在更专注，比现在更诚实，比现在更宽容，比现在更有韧性。你将尽你的职责，内识也将尽它的职责，这将救赎你。</p>
<p>If you give yourself to God, God gives you back to the world. This is why you came. You cannot run away to God. You cannot lose yourself in God. God sent you here. It is like having to go to school as a child and wanting to run home to your mama.</p>
<p>如果你把你自己交给上帝，上帝也会把你还给这个世界。这就是你来到这里的原因。你不能逃向上帝。你不能在上帝中迷失你自己。上帝把你送到了这里。它就像小时候不得不去上学，却想跑回家找妈妈一样。</p>
<p>We are giving you here the most important understanding about sexuality, about relationships, about your life, about your purpose and about the great mysteries that live deep within you.</p>
<p>我们在这里为你提供有关性、有关关系、有关你的生命、有关你的目的以及有关你内心深处的伟大神秘的最重要的理解。</p>
<p>Listen. Consider. Receive the Message that God has sent into the world. Bring it to your religion. Bring it to your culture. Bring it to your family. Bring it to your friends. Bring it to your enemies. Bring it to the people. Then you will see its power and efficacy. And you will see that it has come into the world at just the right time.</p>
<p>聆听。思考。接收上帝发送给这个世界的讯息。把它带进你的宗教。把它带进你的文化。把它带给你的家人。把它带给你的朋友。把它带给你的敌人。把它带给人民。然后你会看到它的力量和功效。你会看到它在正确的时间来到这个世界。</p>
