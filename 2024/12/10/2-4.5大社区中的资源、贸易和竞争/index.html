<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 31, 1997 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1997年1月31日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to give you a clearer understanding of what life is like in the Greater Community, and more specifically what motivates most of those who are coming to visit your world, it is important that We speak further on this subject.</p>
<p>为了让你更清晰地理解大社区中的生命是什么样的，尤其是让你理解大多数来访问你们世界的存在者的动机，我们有必要进一步谈论这个话题。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, societies that have developed technologically and have expanded their empires always outstrip their own world’s natural resources and therefore must seek resources from beyond their own boundaries. This brings them into the realm of trade and commerce. As a result, they are involved in a very competitive environment with other worlds that seek the same kinds of resources. This has led overall to a very complicated set of relationships and involvements, alliances and so forth, amongst nations and races that are involved in trade and commerce.</p>
<p>在大社区中，那些在技术上得到发展并扩张帝国的社会总是会超出他们自己世界的自然资源，因此必须从他们自己边界之外寻求资源。这让他们进入了贸易和商业领域。因此，它们与其他寻求同类资源的世界处于非常激烈的竞争环境中。这总体上导致了在参与贸易和商业的国家和种族之间，形成了一套非常复杂的关系、牵涉、联盟等等。</p>
<p>The need for resources and the nature of the competitive environment account in large part for the motivation for most of those groups who are visiting your world at this time. They are primarily concerned with gaining resources from your world—biological resources, mineral resources and genetic resources. They are driven by this need.</p>
<p>对资源的需求和竞争环境的性质在很大程度上决定了此时访问你们世界的大多数群体的动机。他们的主要目的是从你们的世界中获取资源——生物资源、矿产资源和遗传资源。他们被这种需求所驱动。</p>
<p>Here again We must emphasize that they are not here because they are connected to spiritual traditions upon the Earth. They are not here to fulfill ancient prophecies. They are not here to spiritually uplift humanity. They will take advantage of spiritual ambitions and spiritual traditions if it meets their need, but that is not their purpose for being here.</p>
<p>在此，我们必须再次强调，他们来到这里并不是因为他们与地球上的精神传统有关。他们来到这里不是为了实现古老的预言。他们来到这里不是为了在精神上提升人类。如果符合他们的需求，他们会利用精神抱负和精神传统，但这不是他们来到这里的目的。</p>
<p>Here you must come to understand that your world is recognized as a rich biological storehouse, a world that represents tremendous resource capacities. This naturally makes it interesting to those on the outside. What human beings take for granted in their natural environment, what they spoil and neglect here, is in fact highly prized by others who are aware of it.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须理解，你们的世界被认为是一个丰富的生物宝库，一个代表着巨大资源容量的世界。这自然会让外界的种族对它感兴趣。人类在自然环境中视为理所当然的事情，他们在这里糟蹋和忽视的事情，事实上却被其他察觉到这一点的种族视为珍宝。</p>
<p>Here again We draw upon the analogy of the ancient dwellers in the jungle, who find themselves discovered for purposes that they cannot even fathom. They are discovered because others are looking for resources. They are looking for wealth. They are driven by their own needs and by the competitive environment that they live within. In the history of this world, how often has this been demonstrated, and how often has the native population been decimated or forever changed as a result?</p>
<p>在这里，我们再次引用丛林中古代居民的类比，他们发现他们被发现的目的甚至连他们自己都无法理解。他们被发现是因为其他人在寻找资源。他们在寻找财富。他们被他们自己的需求和他们所处的竞争环境所驱动。在这个世界的历史中，有多少次这样的情况发生过，又有多少次原住民因此被大量杀害或永远改变？</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, not all nations trade. Not all nations seek to have relations beyond their own borders. There are small enclaves of individuals, small groups, that seek to be self-sufficient and not become involved in the complicated affairs of the Greater Community. They seek to remain hidden, to not have their world’s resources discovered. They do not welcome resource explorers. They do not want involvement in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>在大社区中，并非所有国家都进行贸易。并非所有国家都寻求与他们自己边界之外的种族建立关系。有一些由个人、小群体组成的小飞地，他们寻求自给自足，不参与大社区的复杂事务。他们寻求保持隐秘，不让其世界的资源被发现。他们不欢迎资源探索者。他们不想参与大社区的事务。</p>
<p>This is a privilege: the ability to be self-sufficient, the ability to remain outside the sphere of commerce, trade and competition. It is a right that is difficult to achieve and difficult to maintain, particularly if your world’s district or area is recognized to have great assets.</p>
<p>这是一种特权：自给自足的能力，置身于商业、贸易和竞争之外的能力。这种权利很难实现，也很难维持，尤其是如果你所在的世界地区或区域拥有公认的巨大资产。</p>
<p>In the case of your world, it is far too late to achieve this autonomy though it is possible to secure it in the future. The resources of the world have already been recognized and have been utilized for centuries. Now that humanity has become the pre-eminent race on the Earth and poses within itself a potential threat as a potential participant in Greater Community affairs, those who have been using these resources are now taking an active effort to influence humanity, to take advantage of humanity’s weaknesses and to capitalize on humanity’s strengths.</p>
<p>就你们的世界而言，虽然未来有可能实现这种自治，但现在已经为时太晚。这个世界的资源早已被识别并被利用了几个世纪。如今，人类已经成为地球上最卓越的种族，并且作为大社区事务的潜在参与者，对大社区本身构成了潜在威胁，那些一直在利用这些资源的种族现在正积极努力地影响人类，利用人类的弱点，并从人类的优势中获利。</p>
<p>Still others have visited your world merely to observe you—to observe your behavior, to observe your tendencies. And, as We have said earlier, you also have Allies who seek to support the emergence of Knowledge within the world, to support the development of Greater Community Spirituality within the world, to help to lift humanity above and beyond its tribal conflicts and identities so that it may become a responsible and cooperative global race, able to maintain its own resources and to establish its self-determination.</p>
<p>还有一些种族来到你们的世界，只是为了观察你们——观察你们的行为，观察你们的倾向。而且，正如我们之前所说的，你们也有盟友，他们寻求支持内识在世界范围内的出现，支持大社区精神性在世界范围内的发展，帮助人类超越部落冲突和身份认同，从而使人类成为一个负责任的与合作的全球种族，并能够维持它自己的资源，建立它的自决。</p>
<p>It is again very important to recognize that the Greater Community is a physical environment primarily, governed by physical laws of which you are aware. Races of nations everywhere must contend with their fundamental survival needs, which becomes very complicated when you are involved in commerce and trade with other races.</p>
<p>再次非常重要的是要认识到，大社区首先是一个物质环境，受你们所熟知的物理法则支配。无论哪里，种族和国家都必须应对其基本生存需求，而当你们与其他种族进行商业和贸易时，这种情况会变得非常复杂。</p>
<p>If your world is recognized as being rich and valuable, this poses many problems, for others will contend with you for it. Though outright conquest is discouraged among civilized nations, there are subtle means to achieve the same ends. This involves skill and focus in the mental environment and a careful understanding of diplomatic affairs between worlds.</p>
<p>如果你们的世界被公认为富饶而有价值，这就会带来许多问题，因为其他种族会与你们争夺它。虽然文明国家不鼓励直接征服，但有一些微妙的手段可以达到同样的目的。这涉及到心理环境的技巧和专注力，以及对世界间外交事务的仔细理解。</p>
<p>Of course, humanity has none of these skills. It has not developed capabilities in the mental environment. It has not been able to establish a group mind experience that is adequate to meet the situation at hand. And it has no diplomatic skill in terms of dealing with other races.</p>
<p>当然，人类不具备这些技能。它没有发展出心理环境方面的能力。它无法建立足以应对当前局势的群体心灵体验。而且，它缺乏与其他种族打交道的外交技巧。</p>
<p>And yet humanity dwells upon a world that is immensely rich. It is like the native village deep in the jungle, living on top of a great mineral wealth unknowingly, a mineral wealth that draws the rest of the world to it. Such is the case with humanity in the world today.</p>
<p>然而，人类却生活在一个极其富饶的世界上。它就像丛林深处的原住民村落，在不知不觉中生活在巨大的矿产资源之上，而这些矿产资源吸引着世界其他地方的人前来开采。这就是当今世界上人类的现状。</p>
<p>Therefore, again realize that your visitors are here for very prosaic reasons. They are not Divine, and they are not evil. They are simply driven by their own needs. They recognize your weakness and your incompetence, the degradation of the environment, and they seek to establish themselves here to maintain those resources that they desire and to take advantage of humanity’s skills and adaptive abilities.</p>
<p>因此，再次意识到你们的来访者来到这里的原因非常普通。他们不是神圣的，也不是邪恶的。他们只是被他们自己的需求所驱使。他们认识到你们的弱点和无能，认识到环境的恶化，他们试图在这里建立他们自己，以维护他们想要的资源，并利用人类的技能和适应能力。</p>
<p>Should humanity be able to emerge successfully into the Greater Community, it will have to deal with the issue of trade and commerce. This is a very complicated issue and one that requires great skill and discernment on the part of the participants.</p>
<p>如果人类能够成功进入大社区，就必须处理贸易和商业问题。这是一个非常复杂的问题，需要参与者具备高超的技能和敏锐的辨别力。</p>
<p>Here humanity will find itself thwarted in its attempts to go beyond its own solar system, for it will come to find that the regions that it wishes to explore have already been laid claim to. Instead of being seemingly alone in a great empty universe, it will find itself coming up against the properties and interests and priorities of other races.</p>
<p>在这里，人类将发现其自身试图超越它自己太阳系的尝试会受挫，因为人类会发现它想要探索的区域已经被其他种族所占领。它不再是看似孤独地生活在巨大空旷的宇宙中，而是会发现它自己面临着其他种族的财产、利益和优先事项。</p>
<p>There are Greater Community establishments even within this solar system, but they are primarily established to observe affairs upon Earth. Within the Greater Community, amongst trading nations there are certain ethics and standards that are generally followed and honored, though there are notable exceptions. One of these ethics stipulates that a race has primary rights to all worlds within its solar system and that these cannot be violated by force by any outside race. The violation of these ethics brings severe repercussions and can in fact disrupt the flow of trade and commerce, leading to contentiousness and conflict.</p>
<p>甚至在这个太阳系内也有大社区机构，但它们主要是为了观察地球上的事务而设立的。在大社区内部，贸易国之间有一些普遍遵循和遵守的伦理和标准，尽管也有明显的例外。其中一项道德规范规定，一个种族对其太阳系内的所有世界拥有主要权利，任何外来种族都不能以武力侵犯这些权利。违反这些道德规范会带来严重后果，事实上可能会扰乱贸易和商业的流通，导致争执和冲突。</p>
<p>There is also an ethic in the Greater Community that stipulates that should a race spoil its own natural environment, then other races have the right to come and displace it. Though this is a controversial clause and is rarely acted upon, it is still generally held amongst most races that are involved in trade and commerce.</p>
<p>在大社区中，也有一种伦理规定，如果一个种族破坏了它自身的自然环境，那么其他种族有权介入并取而代之。尽管这是一个有争议的条款，并且很少被实施，但在大多数参与贸易和商业的种族中，这个原则仍然普遍存在。</p>
<p>Now the Greater Community is very vast and usually nations that are involved in trade and commerce only have one or two or three trading partners. Everyone does not trade with everyone else. It is far too vast for that. And so when We speak about ethics in Greater Community trade and commerce, We are talking about something that is reinforced for practical reasons, but not by everyone who is involved. We mention this here so that you understand that there are certain standards that govern behavior and are generally recognized, particularly by races in this region in which your world resides.</p>
<p>现在，大社区非常广阔，参与贸易和商业的国家通常只有一个或两三个贸易伙伴。并不是每个种族都会和其他种族进行贸易。因为它太广阔了。因此，当我们谈论大社区贸易和商业中的伦理时，我们所谈论的是出于实际原因而加强的事情，但并不是每个参与其中的种族都会这样做。我们在这里提到这一点，是为了让你理解，存在着某些规范行为的标准，这些标准普遍得到认可，尤其是你们世界所在地区的种族。</p>
<p>Because humanity is in the process of rapidly destroying its natural environment, this gives others the motivation to become involved and to take self-serving action to preserve their interests here and to attempt to offset humanity’s tendencies.</p>
<p>由于人类正在迅速破坏其自然环境，这给了其他种族参与其中并采取自私行动的动机，来维护他们在这里的利益，并试图抵消人类的倾向。</p>
<p>There is an ethic in the Greater Community within trade and commerce that stipulates that military force will not be used amongst trading nations. Violation of this creates disorder and becomes very difficult and costly for those who are involved. And because many nations are skillful in the mental environment, they have found other ways to gain advantages and usually regard use of physical force, such as [that which is] so commonly demonstrated here in the world, as barbaric and unnecessary.</p>
<p>大社区在贸易和商业方面有一种伦理，规定贸易国之间不得使用军事力量。违反这个规定就会造成混乱，使相关国家陷入困境并付出高昂代价。由于许多国家都精通心理环境，他们已经找到了其他获取优势的方法，并通常将使用武力（如世界上常见的武力）视为野蛮和不必要的行为。</p>
<p>This brings Us to a very important point, which We have referred to earlier, but which now requires some explanation. It is very important for you to understand, given what We have presented thus far, that nations that are involved in trade and commerce generally do not represent civilizations that are spiritually advanced. Let Us elaborate on this.</p>
<p>这引出了我们之前提到过的一个非常重要的观点，但现在需要解释一下。鉴于我们迄今为止所介绍的内容，你必须理解，参与贸易和商业的国家通常并不代表精神上先进的文明。让我们详细阐述这一点。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, the ability to exercise Knowledge is recognized as a great skill and asset. And there is generally an attempt to gain access to those who have these skills and to employ them for your own purposes. Therefore, the Wise must retreat to maintain their abilities and the integrity of their own societies.</p>
<p>在大社区中，运用内识的能力被视作一项伟大的技能和资产。通常，人们会试图接触那些拥有这些技能的人，并利用他们来达到自己的目的。因此，智者必须隐退，以维持他们能力的纯粹性以及他们自身社会的完整性。</p>
<p>Those groups and nations that are spiritually advanced, therefore, rarely are involved in trade except in a clandestine manner and attempt at great cost and difficulty to maintain insulation within the Greater Community environment. They have come to recognize everywhere that demonstrating their skill and prowess only invites inquiry and intervention.</p>
<p>因此，那些在精神上先进的群体和国家，除了以秘密的方式之外，很少参与贸易，并试图以巨大的代价和困难在大社区环境中保持隔离。他们已经认识到，展示他们的技能和实力只会招来质疑和干预。</p>
<p>This brings Us to a very fundamental idea in learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge and in preparing for the Greater Community itself. This idea is that the Wise remain hidden. The Wise remain hidden to remain wise. If they do not remain hidden, they are exploited and overtaken.</p>
<p>这引出了我们在学习大社区内识之路以及为大社区做准备时的一个非常基本的想法。这个想法就是：智者保持隐匿。智者保持隐匿是为了保持智慧。如果他们不保持隐匿，他们就会被利用和超越。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to understand that nations that are involved in resource exploration, commerce or the acquisition of properties do not represent those who are spiritually advanced. They do not represent those who are strong in Knowledge. For Knowledge, being the spiritual intelligence, would not promote or allow this to occur amongst those who are bonded to Knowledge and who are close to Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此，重要的是要理解，参与资源勘探、商业或财产收购的国家并不代表那些在精神上先进的国家。他们并不代表那些拥有强大内识的种族。因为内识，作为精神智能，不会促进或允许这种情况发生在那些与内识紧密相连和接近内识的种族之中。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must understand that except for your Allies, who watch you from afar, those who are involved in this world today do not represent the spiritually advanced races of which We speak. There is a great deal of confusion about this, and this confusion will have tragic consequences if it is not corrected.</p>
<p>因此，你必须理解，除了你们的盟友，他们在远处注视着你们，当今世界上的那些来访者并不代表我们所说的精神上先进的种族。在这一点上存在着巨大的困惑，如果不加以纠正，这种困惑将带来悲剧性的后果。</p>
<p>Consider this idea that the Wise remain hidden. Is this not also true within your own world? You will find that the wisest teachers, those who are considered strong and saintly, live in seclusion and are not readily accessible to many people, except in rare situations. And in those rare situations, the skill and ability of these individuals bring upon them great difficulties, considerable scrutiny and intervention, which is very difficult to contend with.</p>
<p>思考这个想法：智者保持隐匿。在你自己的世界中，不也是如此吗？你会发现，最有智慧的老师，那些被认为是强者和圣者的人，都隐居了起来，除了在极少数情况下，许多人都无法轻易接近他们。而在那些极少数情况下，这些人的技能和能力会给他们带来巨大的困难、大量的审查和干预，这是很难应对的。</p>
<p>Thus, within your own world, the Wise remain hidden. The greatest teachers within the world are hard to find. Though they may publish their works in a written form, they reserve their greatest talents and gifts for the serious students who have taken the pains to find them and who have committed themselves to study, to learn the greater ways of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此，在你自己的世界里，智者保持隐匿。世界上最伟大的老师很难被找到。尽管他们可能会以书面形式出版他们的作品，但他们会将他们最伟大的才能和礼物留给那些不辞辛苦找到他们并致力于学习更伟大内识方式的认真的学生。</p>
<p>This is even more true in the Greater Community, where intelligence is recognized as a resource and is sought after and highly valued. Thus, those who are wise and strong in The Way of Knowledge attempt to find retreat in the Greater Community. They attempt to insulate their societies, and to protect and preserve their mental integrity, and to fortify [themselves] against outside intervention from interfering with the mental environment they have taken such great pains to create and to maintain.</p>
<p>在大社区中，情况更是如此，在那里，智能被视为一种资源，受到人们的追捧和高度重视。因此，那些在内识之路上明智而强大的人试图在大社区里寻找退路。他们试图隔绝他们的社会，保护和维护他们心理的完整性，并强化[他们自己]，防止外界干预他们如此煞费苦心创造和维护的心理环境。</p>
<p>You can think of many examples within your world—between the individual who is the salesman and the individual who is the saint. Which takes a strong public stance and which withdraws to remain hidden?</p>
<p>在你的世界中，你可以想到许多这样的例子——在推销员和圣人之间。哪一个会在公众面前立场坚定，哪一个会在公众面前退缩来保持隐匿？</p>
<p>Therefore, do not make the critical and fatal error of thinking that those who are visiting the world are spiritually advanced. Because they have skill in the mental environment, because they may be able to communicate without words and have great skill in influencing those whom they encounter does not mean that they are spiritually advanced or that they are guided by Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>因此，不要犯下一个关键且致命的错误，认为那些访问世界的来访者是精神上先进的。因为他们拥有心理环境的技能，因为他们能够无声地交流，在影响他们遇到的人方面，他们有很高的技能，但这并不意味着他们在精神上是先进的，也不意味着他们受到内识本身的指导。</p>
<p>This is a critical understanding. Here you begin to realize both the strengths of your visitors and their weaknesses. And here you can more fully understand the strengths that humanity already has. For humanity—despite its tribal conflicts and its self-preoccupation and its destructive tendencies—has been able to maintain rich spiritual heritages within the world. Knowledge has been kept alive within the world, to a far greater extent than it has within the Greater Community itself. Again, you must distinguish technological advancement and skill in the mental environment from spiritual awareness, understanding and capability.</p>
<p>这是一种至关重要的理解。在这里，你开始意识到来访者的优势和弱点。在这里，你可以更充分地理解人类已经拥有的优势。因为人类——尽管存在部落冲突、自我关注和破坏性倾向——却能够在世界上保持丰富的精神遗产。内识在世界范围内得以延续，其存活程度远高于在大社区本身内存活的程度。再次强调，你必须区分技术进步和心理环境中的技能以及精神觉知、精神理解和精神能力。</p>
<p>Those who develop skill in Knowledge will seek to preserve their skill and will have to learn to recognize all the forces around them that seek to intervene and to prevent their skill from being cultivated and expressed appropriately.</p>
<p>那些发展内识技能的人将寻求维护他们的技能，并且必须学会识别周围试图干预和阻止其技能得到培养和适当表达的各种力量。</p>
<p>For example, if you were an individual who had a great capacity to know, to foresee events to come, to discern relationships, and to have ability in the mental environment, would not others seek you out for their own advantages? If it became known that you had these skills, would you not then be sought after?</p>
<p>例如，如果你是一位具有极大知道能力、能够预见未来的事件、能够辨别人际关系，并且在心理环境方面拥有能力的人，其他人难道不会为了他们自己的利益而寻求你吗？如果人们知道你有这些技能，你难道不会受到追捧吗？</p>
<p>Everyone would want you to help them with their problems, and though you may want to contribute to others and to bestow your gifts upon them, over time you would have to learn to become discerning as to where to give your gifts and where to withhold them, who is the real recipient and who merely wishes to use you for their own purposes.</p>
<p>每个人都会希望你帮助他们解决问题，尽管你可能想要为他人做出贡献，将你的礼物赠予他们，但随着时间的推移，你必须学会​​辨别在哪里给予你的礼物，在哪里保留你的礼物，谁是真正的接收者，谁只是想利用你来达到他们自己的目的。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, this education becomes vital for survival, for there is skill in the mental environment, and others will seek to use you for their own benefit. What little rewards you may receive from them are far outweighed by the loss of freedom, the loss of ability and the ultimate promise of collapse that their involvement will bring for you.</p>
<p>在大社区中，这种教育对生存至关重要，因为在心理环境中存在着技能，其他人会为了他们自己的利益而利用你。你从他们那里可能获得的微薄回报，远远无法弥补你在与他们的参与中所失去的自由、能力，以及最终会给你带来的崩溃承诺。</p>
<p>In the world today, those who have great sensitivities, who have cultivated their psychic abilities, either for pleasure or for profit, and have attempted to make these skills known, put themselves at great risk. They do not realize what jeopardy they place themselves in.</p>
<p>在当今世界，那些具有高度敏感性、培养了他们通灵能力的人，无论是出于乐趣还是利益，并试图让这些技能为人所知，都会将他们自己置于极大的危险之中。他们并没有意识到他们自己被置身于何种危险之中。</p>
<p>This is attempting to have power without wisdom. Wisdom always tries to protect the gift of the giver and to direct the giving where it can be most effective.</p>
<p>这是试图在没有智慧的情况下获得力量。智慧总是试图保护赠予者的礼物，并将赠予引导到最有效的地方。</p>
<p>In the world today, the Greater Community forces who are present are especially interested in those who have great psychic abilities, who have made these publicly known and available. You may wonder why people are receiving so many messages from so many places and why there is such confusion and conflict between the messages that people receive. And you may wonder, “Where do these messages come from?” Let Us speak on this now.</p>
<p>在当今世界上，存在的大社区势力对那些拥有强大通灵能力的人特别感兴趣，他们将这些能力公之于众。你可能会问，为什么人们从如此多地方接收到如此多讯息，为什么人们接收到的讯息之间会如此混乱和冲突。你可能会问：“这些讯息从何而来？”现在就让我们来谈谈这个问题。</p>
<p>It is important to understand that people in the world have very little skill so far in being able to distinguish the mental environment from the spiritual reality. There is a great deal of level confusion here.</p>
<p>重要的是要理解，迄今为止，世界上的人们还无法区分心理环境和精神现实。这里存在着大量的层面困惑。</p>
<p>People think if they are intuitive and have psychic experiences that this is spiritual in nature, but that is not true. For those who have absolutely no spiritual awareness or foundation can learn to exercise great skill in the mental environment. They can read and interpret the thoughts of others, and they can cast an influence on the environment so that others over time will come to think the way they want them to think.</p>
<p>人们认为，如果他们有直觉并且有通灵体验，这自然就是精神上的，但事实并非如此。对于那些完全没有精神觉知或基础的人来说，他们可以学会在心理环境中施展高超的技巧。他们可以阅读并解读他人的思想，他们可以对环境施加影响，这样，随着时间的推移，其他人就会按照他们希望的方式去思考。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who feel they have had spiritual contact when in fact they are in contact with those in the Greater Community. It is not difficult for the world’s visitors to utilize the spiritual superstitions and imagery that are present today to make contact and to gain influence.</p>
<p>当今世界上有许多人认为他们与精神界有过接触，但事实上他们是在与大社区中的生命进行接触。对于世界上的来访者来说，利用当今存在的精神迷信和精神意象来建立联系并获得影响力并不困难。</p>
<p>In fact, in the world today there is great effort amongst your visitors to gain access to those who are spiritually sensitive, who are mentally sensitive and to cast an influence upon them. Here the emphasis is to align these individuals with the source of the message, to pacify them and to put them in a state of pliant receptivity.</p>
<p>事实上，在当今世界上，你们的来访者正在努力接触那些精神上敏感、心理上敏感的人，并对他们施加影响。这里的重点是让这些人与讯息来源保持一致，安抚他们，并让他们处于一种顺从的接受的状态。</p>
<p>This has tragic consequences, for the persons who are affected over time will lose their personal will. They will lose their self-determination. They will lose their ability to discriminate and to discern. They will be encouraged to be constantly open to whatever is given to them, and over time they will not be able to discern whether what is being given to them is correct or not. They will be enthralled, but they will also be enslaved. This then represents subtle manipulation of the mental environment.</p>
<p>这会带来悲剧性的后果，因为随着时间的推移，受影响的人将失去个人意志。他们将失去他们的自我决定。他们将失去辨别和分辨的能力。他们会被鼓励始终对所给予的事物保持开放，而随着时间的推移，他们将无法辨别给予他们的事物是否正确。他们将被迷惑，但也会被奴役。这代表了对心理环境的微妙操控。</p>
<p>Please do not be confused in thinking that all people who are receiving spiritual counsel are being affected by the Greater Community, for this is not the case. There is also a great deal of work being done by the forces of the Creator to enlighten humanity, to direct humanity, to uplift humanity. But if you step back and look at the whole picture, you will see that both of these activities are going on, and there is a great deal of confusion.</p>
<p>请不要误认为所有接受精神指导的人都受到了大社区的影响，因为事实并非如此。造物主的力量也在做着大量工作，以启迪人类、指导人类、提升人类。但如果你退后一步，看看整个画面，你会发现这两种活动都在进行，并且存在着大量的混乱。</p>
<p>So how do you sort this out? How do you make sense out of this? How do you say, “Well, which is true guidance and which is a form of manipulation?” The key question and the key element in answering this and resolving it for yourself has to do with the reclamation of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此，你如何理清这一点？你如何理解这一点？你如何说：“好吧，哪一个是真实的指导，哪一个是一种操控？”回答这个问题并为你自己解决这个问题的关键问题和关键因素与与内识的开垦有关。</p>
<p>Any spiritual teaching that fortifies the individual’s ability to see, to know, to discern and to act represents a true teaching and a true counsel. Any teaching that encourages the person to acquiesce, to become pliant, to become indiscriminately receptive, to give up their self-determination, to acquiesce, to become entirely subjective in their viewpoint, these individuals are suffering from a form of manipulation. Regardless of the emphasis on spirituality, Knowledge is being taken away from them. They are being encouraged to be divorced from what they know and what they most deeply feel.</p>
<p>任何能够增强个人看见、知道、辨别和行动能力的精神教导都代表着真实的教导和真实的忠告。任何鼓励人们默许、变得顺从、变得不加区别地接受、放弃自我决定、顺从、在观点上变得完全主观的教导，都是在遭受某种形式的操纵。无论多么强调精神性，他们的内识正在被剥夺。他们被鼓励脱离他们所知道的和他们最深切的感受。</p>
<p>You can see the manifestation of both of these tendencies in the world today, and it will take great care and discernment to be able to tell them apart. For the language used may be very similar. The ideals presented may seem to be one and the same. But the entire emphasis of the teaching is different.</p>
<p>你可以在当今世界上看到这两种倾向的表现，要想将它们区分开来，需要非常细心和敏锐的辨别力。因为它们使用的语言可能非常相似。所提出的理想似乎是一样的。但整个教导的重点却是不同的。</p>
<p>As We have said, the Greater Community forces who are in the world today, who are seeking to gain dominion here, will attempt to use two fundamental arenas of human authority—the institutions of government and the institutions of religion. These represent the two great power centers in human affairs, and these are where most of the attention will be focused.</p>
<p>正如我们所说的，当今世界上的大社区势力试图在这里获得统治权，他们将试图利用人类权威的两个基本领域——政府机构和宗教机构。这两个领域代表了人类事务中的两大权力中心，也是大多数注意力将集中的地方。</p>
<p>Yet it is important to understand that any individual who demonstrates a unique and greater sensitivity also becomes a target of inquiry for those from the Greater Community. For remember, greater sensitivity, greater insight, is something that your visitors are looking for. It is something they need.</p>
<p>然而，重要的是要理解，任何展现出独特和更高敏感度的人也会成为大社区探寻的对象。请记住，更高的敏感度、更高的洞察力是你们的来访者所寻求的人。这是他们所需要的人。</p>
<p>They need these natural intuitive capabilities in order to establish themselves here, for they do not have an intuitive connection to this world. They do not have an intuitive connection to life forms and the forces of nature. They are not connected to the elements of the Earth, so they need these capabilities and will seek them out in individuals wherever they can find them. And those who are the most open and the most indiscriminate are the most vulnerable for this kind of intervention.</p>
<p>他们需要这些自然的直觉能力，才能在这里立足，因为他们与这个世界没有直观联系。他们与生命形式和自然力量没有直观联系。他们与地球上的各种元素没有联系，所以他们需要这些能力，并会在任何可以找到的个体中寻求它们。而那些最开放、最不加区分的人最容易受到这种干预。</p>
<p>In learning The Way of Knowledge, men and women are encouraged to develop great sensitivity and the ability to focus, but they are also prepared to be very discerning and to learn to understand the greater forces within themselves and within their immediate environment that affect them and how these effects are brought about. They are encouraged to take a very sober approach to relationships and to interactions in the world.</p>
<p>在学习内识之路的过程中，我们鼓励男性和女性培养高度的敏感性和专注力，同时也要学会非常辨别，并学会理解他们自己和他们周围环境中影响他们的更强大的力量，以及这些影响是如何产生的。他们被鼓励以一种非常清醒的态度对待关系和与世界的互动。</p>
<p>How different this is from the great romantic ideals that are promoted within certain spiritual circles. How different this is from those who become swept up in the glorious images of themselves in the world or in their strict ideologies that were established long ago.</p>
<p>这与某些精神圈子中所倡导的伟大浪漫理想是多么不同。这与那些沉浸在他们自己在世界上的辉煌形象或早已建立的严格意识形态中的人是多么不同。</p>
<p>The man or woman of Knowledge must learn to see and see clearly, must learn to discern where to open themselves and where not to open themselves, where to give their gifts and where not to give their gifts. They must come to recognize the greater forces, those forces that are beneficial and those forces that are not beneficial, both within the world itself and within the Greater Community into which your world is now emerging.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人或女人必须学会看见和看清，必须学会辨别在哪里开放他们自己，在哪里不开放他们自己，在哪里送出他们的礼物，在哪里不送出他们的礼物。他们必须认识到更伟大的力量，那些有益的力量和那些无益的力量，既包括世界本身，也包括你们的世界正在融入的大社区。</p>
<p>People who promote the development of sensitivity without this discrimination and without this training and preparation are encouraging people to be at great risk. Even if the Greater Community were not here, this would still produce great risk. For if you become too sensitive without discernment, it becomes very difficult to live within the world. The world becomes too irritating, too harsh, too grating to experience, and you are forced to withdraw, not to cultivate your strengths but simply to avoid the vicissitudes of life. Here the individual becomes weaker and weaker, less capable. They lose strength, they lose self-determination, they lose the ability to interact with life.</p>
<p>那些在没有辨别力、没有这种训练和准备的情况下促进敏感性发展的人，实际上是在让人们面临极大的风险。即使没有大社区的存在，这依然会带来巨大的风险。因为如果你变得过于敏感却没有辨别力，生活在这个世界中就会变得非常困难。世界会变得过于刺激、过于严苛、令人无法忍受，你将被迫退缩，而不是为了培养你的力量，而仅仅是为了避免生命的沧桑。在这里，个人会变得越来越软弱，能力越来越差。他们失去了力量，失去了自我决定，失去了与生命互动的能力。</p>
<p>This is happening in the world today. It is being accelerated by the presence of the Greater Community, who have the power to neutralize the human spirit. They have the power to gain control over the prevailing ideas and beliefs of people here.</p>
<p>这种情况正在当今世界上发生。大社区的存在加速了这种情况的发生，他们有能力削弱人类的精神。他们有能力控制这里人们的普遍想法和信仰。</p>
<p>The only real defense against this is the cultivation of Knowledge and the development of a Greater Community perspective and understanding. Here men and women require skill—the skill to find Knowledge within themselves, the great knowing Mind that you have been endowed with from the Creator; the skills to discern interactions, to discern the mental environment and to discern the greater forces that are affecting humanity and that are moving you within your own life.</p>
<p>唯一真正能抵御这种情况的办法就是培养内识，发展大社区的视角和理解力。在这里，男人和女人都需要技能——在他们自己内在发现内识的技能，即造物主赋予你们的伟大的知道心灵；辨别互动的技能，辨别心理环境的技能，辨别影响人类并在你自己的生命中推动你的更伟大力量的技能。</p>
<p>It is quite remarkable, but people do not realize the extent of influence upon their lives. There is a general belief that people are the captain of their own ship, and yet when you visit their ship there is no captain to be found. There is no authority; there is no determination. The ambivalence and passivity that you see within people is evidence that they are not in charge of their affairs and have not taken responsibility for their lives or for their destiny.</p>
<p>这非常值得注意，但人们并没有意识到这种影响对他们生命的影响程度。普遍存在一种信念，即人们是他们自己船的船长，然而，当你访问他们的船时却找不到船长。没有权威；也没有决心。你在人们身上看到的矛盾和被动表明他们没有掌控他们的事务，没有对他们的生命或他们的天命负责。</p>
<p>The mental environment of people everywhere has been dominated by forces that are generated from beyond themselves to such an extent that they cannot even discern what is theirs and what is not theirs. In fact, there is very little original thinking within the human family at this time. This is both sad and tragic. It is sad because the human spirit is creative and wonderfully endowed. And it is tragic because this brings grave possibilities for humanity as it undergoes its emergence into the Greater Community.</p>
<p>世界各地人们的心理环境已经被来自他们自己之外的势力所主导，以至于他们甚至无法辨别什么是他们的，什么不是他们的。事实上，此时此刻，人类大家庭中很少有原创思维。这既令人感到悲哀，也充满悲剧性。它令人悲伤，因为人类的精神是创造性的，而且天赋异禀。而它也充满悲剧性，因为这给人类带来了严峻的可能性，尤其是在人类迈向大社区的过程中。</p>
<p>To be within the Greater Community, you must be smarter than you have ever been, more discerning than you have ever been, more responsible than you have ever been, and you must become strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>要想跻身大社区的行列，你必须比以往任何时候都更聪明，比以往任何时候都更有洞察力，比以往任何时候都更有责任感，你必须成为内识的强者。</p>
<p>If you could go beyond your world and travel about the Greater Community, you would see how races everywhere have been enslaved and dominated because they have not developed these fundamental capabilities. There is very little freedom in the Greater Community. There is very little personal freedom in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>如果你能走出你的世界，在大社区中旅行，你会看到各地的种族是如何被奴役和统治的，因为他们没有发展出这些基本能力。大社区中几乎没有自由。在大社区中，个人自由是非常稀有的。</p>
<p>This is difficult to accept, perhaps, but it is essential for your education. Freedom is the result of gaining these skills We have indicated and to cultivate them within yourself and within your relationships and within your communities. The failure to do this naturally leads one and naturally leads one’s society to become dominated. In the Greater Community, the strong do rule the weak, as is the case within the world.</p>
<p>这也许很难接受，但这对你的教育是至关重要的。自由是获得我们所指出的这些技能的结果，并在你自己、你的关系和你的社区中培养这些技能的结果。做不到这一点，自然会导致一个人以及你的社会被支配。在大社区中，强者统治弱者，就像世界上的情况一样。</p>
<p>Within Greater Community commerce and trade, there are many, many societies that are merely client states of other races. They have lost their self-determination, both through the contracts that they establish with other races and through their ability, or lack of ability, to maintain their focus and their determination within their relationships with others. This is prevalent in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>在大社区的商业和贸易中，有许许多多的社会只是其他种族的附庸国。他们已经失去了自主权，一方面是因为他们与其他种族建立了契约，也通过他们在与其他种族的关系中保持专注和决心的能力（或缺乏能力）。这种情况在大社区十分普遍。</p>
<p>Indeed, if you could travel about widely, you would see that it is rare when you find a race that is truly independent and self-determined. This is the result of lack of training and ability, and in part it is the result of engagement with other races and of becoming interdependent with them.</p>
<p>事实上，如果你能广泛旅行，你就会看到，真正独立自主的种族是非常少见的。这是缺乏训练和能力的结果，在某种程度上，这也是与其他种族接触和相互依存的结果。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Wise remain hidden in the Greater Community and within your world. But humanity is not hidden, and it is not yet wise enough to maintain its insulation or to discern intervention from the outside.</p>
<p>因此，智者仍然隐藏在大社区和你们的世界中。但是，人类并没有隐藏起来，它还没有足够的智慧来保持其独立性，也无法辨别来自外界的干预。</p>
<p>So here again We come to a situation. We come to find that humanity is at a great disadvantage, that humanity is extremely vulnerable, that humanity does not have the skill or the discernment or the cooperation within its own family to maintain a strong and self-determined position in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>因此，我们再次面临这样的情况。我们发现人类处于极大的劣势，人类极其脆弱，人类在它自己的大家庭中还没有技能、辨别力或合作能力，无法在大社区中保持强大和自决的地位。</p>
<p>And here We find that humanity is dwelling upon a world whose wealth and value it does not yet fully realize. It has not had the exposure to the Greater Community to understand its wealth or its grave predicament. This is the unfortunate result of living in isolation for so long.</p>
<p>在这里，我们发现，人类正生活在一个尚未充分认识到其财富和价值的世界。人类尚未接触大社区，无法理解其财富或它的严重困境。这是长期生活在孤立状态中的不幸结果。</p>
<p>But now there is a great calling around the world for people to gain strength, to become strong individually and collectively, to gain the power of Knowledge, which is their greatest endowment and natural birthright, to gain the foundation for cooperation in union with others and to unite the world beyond tribal and cultural differences.</p>
<p>但现在世界各地都存在着一种伟大的召唤，召唤人们获得力量，成为个人和集体的强者，获得内识的力量，这是他们最伟大的天赋和与生俱来的权利，获得与他人联合合作的基础，超越部落和文化的差异来团结世界。</p>
<p>For it is only a united humanity that will be able to survive and to prosper in the Greater Community. A world warring in divisive groups and tribes can only fall under the domination of outside forces who will take advantage of these conflicts and of these identifications and of these preoccupations for their own advantages.</p>
<p>因为只有团结起来的人类才能在大社区中生存和繁荣。一个分裂的群体和部落之间战乱的世界，只能落入外来势力的统治之下，这些势力将利用这些冲突、这些认同和这些先入为主的想法为他们自己谋利。</p>
<p>To prosper and to survive in the Greater Community, to maintain your freedom and self-determination within this larger environment of life, humanity must become unified. This will be a great, difficult and painful process, but life requires it, your circumstances require it, the presence of the Greater Community here requires it.</p>
<p>为了在大社区中繁荣和生存，为了在这个更广阔的生命环境中维护你们的自由和自决，人类必须实现统一。这将是一个伟大、艰难和痛苦的过程，但生命需要它，你们的环境需要它，大社区在这里的存在也需要它。</p>
<p>This will be fostered by the growing realization that humanity is in a grave situation and that everyone everywhere within the world is in the same situation and has the same fundamental problem. This problem will be generated by the deterioration of the natural world, by the loss of the world’s resources, and most fundamentally by the presence of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>人类正处在严峻的处境中，世界各地的每个人都处于同样的处境中，面临着同样的根本问题，这个认识将进一步促进这个进程。这个问题的产生源于自然界的恶化、世界资源的流失，而最根本的是大社区的存在。</p>
<p>It is unfortunate but true that only a threat from the outside will be able to finally unite humanity and to establish a common need and a common cause here that will enable people to step above and beyond their tribal differences and identities.</p>
<p>令人遗憾，但却真实的是，只有来自外部的威胁才能最终团结人类，在这里建立起共同的需求和共同的事业，使人们能够超越部落的差异和身份的认同。</p>
<p>A world full of divisive tribes cannot survive in the Greater Community. It cannot maintain its self-determination, for it will not be strong enough. It will not have the cooperation and the strength necessary to contend with other races who have achieved a state of uniformity and who represent a group will.</p>
<p>一个充满分裂部落的世界无法在大社区中生存。它无法维持它的自决，因为它不够强大。它将缺乏必要的合作和力量，以对抗那些已经实现统一状态并代表群体意志的其他种族。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you makes this possible, but there must be a way to Knowledge, a Greater Community Way of Knowledge that can prepare you to understand the Greater Community, to understand your true nature, to enable you to gain your essential strength and to claim your greatest endowments for the restoration and the protection of the world.</p>
<p>你内在的内识让这成为可能，但必须存在一条通向内识的道路，一条通往大社区内识的道路，它能够让你进行准备去理解大社区，理解你的真实自然，让你能够获得你必不可缺少的力量，并为世界的修复和保护而宣称你最伟大的禀赋。</p>
<p>Because of humanity’s degradation of its natural environment, it will be forced in the future to seek resources from beyond its separate shores. This will place requirements upon the human race and will require the cultivation of significant and tremendous skills and abilities, for you will not find that the universe is there for your taking.</p>
<p>由于人类对自然环境的破坏，未来人类将被迫从其各自海岸之外寻找资源。这将对人类提出更高的要求，需要培养显著且极大的技能和能力，因为你们将发现宇宙不是你们可以随意索取的。</p>
<p>It is as if the world were a house and your solar system represented your yard. You may go around your yard as you please, but if you seek to go beyond it, you enter someone else’s property. You trespass on someone else’s interests or establishments.</p>
<p>它就好像世界是一座房子，而你们的太阳系代表着你们的院子。你们可以随心所欲地绕着院子走，但如果你们想要越过它，你们就进入了他人的领地。你们侵犯了他人的利益或机构。</p>
<p>Here you will find that trade and commerce are largely self-regulated. There is no one great organization that rules and manages everything. That is not possible in a Greater Community environment. Certain ethics and standards are maintained for practical reasons—to maintain peace, to maintain continuity of trade and to establish an environment where most nations can prosper, even if a few suffer as a result.</p>
<p>在这里，你会发现，贸易和商业在很大程度上是自我监管的。没有一个伟大的组织统治和管理一切。这在大社区环境中是不可能的。某些伦理和标准是出于实际原因而维持的——为了维护和平，维护贸易的连续性，并建立一个大多数国家都能繁荣的环境，即使少数国家因此而受苦。</p>
<p>Here humanity will find itself in the midst of a larger interaction of life, in a situation that has been long established and will not be changed by humanity’s entrance. It is like the young child entering the world. They may have great ideas about themselves and great expectations about what life will give them, but once they enter the real world, it is quite different.</p>
<p>在这里，人类将发现他自己处于一种更广阔的生命互动之中，处于一种早已确立的、不会因人类的进入而改变的境况之中。它就像初入这个世界的幼童。他们可能对他们自己有伟大的想法，对生命将给予他们什么抱有很大的期望，但一旦他们进入现实的世界，情况就大不相同了。</p>
<p>Humanity here is like the adolescent venturing out into life for the first time, filled with ideals, filled with expectations, filled with a sense of omnipotence and divine appointment, but what awaits humanity in the Greater Community is a difficult and sobering learning process.</p>
<p>人类在这里就像初次踏入生命的青少年，充满理想，充满期待，充满无所不能和神圣任命的感觉，但在大社区等待人类的是一个艰难和令人深省的学习过​​程。</p>
<p>Yet for humanity to even have this opportunity to participate in the Greater Community, to engage in trade and commerce, which will become necessary in the future, it must develop the foundation, it must have the strength and the environment of cooperation within the human family to even be able to begin.</p>
<p>然而，人类要想有机会参与大社区、从事未来所必需的贸易和商业，就必须发展好基础，必须拥有力量，必须拥有人类大家庭内部合作的环境，才有可能开始。</p>
<p>You may ask, “What does this have to do with me? I am just a person. I am just an individual. I have to go to work tomorrow. I have to take care of my own affairs!”</p>
<p>你可能会问：“这和我有什么关系？我只是一个人。我只是一个个体。我明天还要上班。我得处理好我自己的事情！”</p>
<p>This has everything to do with you because the greater purpose that brought you into the world is directly related to the evolution of the world and to the greater needs of humanity. Whatever your gift may be, however it may be expressed, everything We are presenting in this book is entirely relevant to your ability to comprehend your true nature and to express it effectively.</p>
<p>这与你息息相关，因为让你来到这个世界的更伟大目的与世界的进化和人类的更伟大需求直接相关。无论你的礼物是什么，无论你如何表达它，我们在本书中介绍的一切都与你理解你的真实自然并有效表达它的能力完全相关。</p>
<p>Here within the realm of your own life, you will find that the precept, “The Wise remain hidden,” is entirely true and valid. Here within the context of your own life, you will see that you too have to maintain and establish your own mental environment, and learn how to do this and how to maintain it in a world that will always be seeming to break it down. Here you too, within the context of your own life, will have to learn what the foundation of real relationship is and how greater harmony and cooperation can be established in your affairs with others.</p>
<p>在这里，在你自己生命的领域中，你会发现“智者隐匿”这个箴言是完全真实和有效的。在这里，在你自己生命的背景中，你会看到你也必须维护和建立你自己的心理环境，并学习如何做到这一点，以及如何在一个似乎总是要打破它的世界中维护它。在这里，在你自己生命的背景中，你也必须学习什么是真正关系的基础，以及如何在你与他人的事务中建立更伟大的和谐与合作。</p>
<p>Everything that is true in the Greater Community holds true within the sphere of your own life. But even as you come to realize this, should you undertake the preparation in The Way of Knowledge, you will also find that it is necessary for you to understand the greater panorama of life in which you live.</p>
<p>大社区中的一切真理也适用于你自己的生命领域。但即使你意识到了这一点，如果你在内识之路上进行准备，你也会发现，你有必要去理解你生活在其中的更广阔的生命全景。</p>
<p>It is not enough simply to take care of your own personal affairs and to maintain yourself, for you have a greater responsibility and a greater opportunity in life. If you seek to know your true nature, if you seek to experience and to express the greater purpose that has brought you into the world, then you must step beyond your self-preoccupation. You must not only manage your affairs harmoniously, but see what awaits you beyond that, what calls to you to respond.</p>
<p>仅仅处理好你自己的个人事务和保持你自己是不够的，因为你在生命中肩负着一种更伟大的责任和一个更伟大的机会。如果你想知道你自己的真实自然，如果你想体验和表达将你带到这个世界上的更伟大的目的，那么你就必须超越你的自我关注。你不仅必须和谐地管理你的事务，还要看到除此之外还有内识正在等待着你，还有内识在召唤着你去回应。</p>
<p>There are no great rewards in leading a small and self-centered life. There are only small rewards and great costs. But entering into a greater life, there are great costs but great rewards, far greater than the costs involved.</p>
<p>过着小而自我中心的生命不会带来伟大的回报。只有小回报和大代价。但进入更伟大的生命，代价很大，但回报也很大，远大于代价。</p>
<p>You can only know this to be true by taking the steps yourself and by discovering what they mean for you. We can only point to the greater environment in which you live and to the greater forces that are shaping your life and your future and destiny. But you yourself must find out.</p>
<p>你只有亲自迈出这一步，并发现它们对你的意义，你才能知道这是真实的。我们只能指出你生活的更大环境和塑造你的生命、未来和天命的更强大的力量。但是，你自己必须找出答案。</p>
<p>Here We give you the perspective and the understanding that will enable you to truly comprehend the nature of your presence here and the greater events that are shaping the destiny of the world.</p>
<p>在这里，我们为你提供视角和理解，这将使你能够真正理解你在此存在的自然，以及正在塑造世界天命的更伟大事件。</p>
