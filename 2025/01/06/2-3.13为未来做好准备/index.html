<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 5, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007年9月5日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At every moment you can live life to the fullest, but you are also here to prepare for the future. Preparing for the future, then, is an integral part of life. Every day you do this in many ways without even thinking about it. And yet consciously preparing for the future is very important and represents an aspect of intelligence.</p>
<p>每时每刻，你都可以充分的生活在生命中，但你也在这里为未来做准备。因此，为未来做准备是生命不可或缺的一部分。每天你都会以多种方式做这件事，甚至不需要思考。然而，有意识地为未来做准备是非常重要的，它代表着智能的一个方面。</p>
<p>To live only for the moment is not intelligent, for that is not what life asks of you. For you must be prepared for certain eventualities, and you must be prepared for certain mundane events, which you can even anticipate at this moment.</p>
<p>只活在当下并不明智，因为这不是生命对你的要求。因为你必须为某些可能发生的情况做好准备，你必须为某些平凡的事件做好准备，而这些事件你此刻甚至可以预料到。</p>
<p>The future, however, can be overbearing. People often try to escape by believing that God will take care of them, or life will take care of them in the future, so they do not need to plan and to prepare for themselves. They think they do not need to make preparations or acquire provisions for themselves for the future, for God or life will take care of them. Those people try to escape into the present to avoid the burden of their anxiety about the future. But the future need not generate undue anxiety. Concern, yes, but not undue anxiety.</p>
<p>然而，未来可能令人难以忍受。人们常常试图逃避，相信上帝会照顾他们，或者生命会照顾他们，所以他们不需要为他们自己计划和准备。他们认为他们自己不需要为未来做准备或获得供给，因为上帝或生命会照顾他们。这些人试图逃避现实，以避免对未来的焦虑负担。但未来不必产生过度的焦虑。担忧是可以的，但不是过度的焦虑。</p>
<p>To be responsible to yourself and to others, you must accept that you have a fundamental duty to prepare for the future adequately. This has greater significance now, for you are preparing for a future that will be unlike the past. You are preparing for a world of declining resources, a world whose environment has been disrupted significantly, a world where there will be climate change and violent weather. A world where the risk of competition, conflict and war over the remaining resources will be extreme and very dangerous.</p>
<p>为了对你自己和他人负责，你必须承认你有充分准备未来的基本责任。这现在具有更大的意义，因为你正在为一个不同于过去的未来做准备。你正在为一个资源日益减少的世界做准备，一个环境遭到严重破坏的世界，一个将出现气候变化和恶劣天气的世界。一个争夺剩余资源的竞争、冲突和战争风险将极其高昂且非常危险的世界。</p>
<p>If your life up to this point has not been unduly difficult, then perhaps you will assume this will be the case in the future. But that would be a very unwise assumption.</p>
<p>如果你的生命到目前为止还没有过得特别艰难，那么你也许会认为未来也会如此。但这是一个非常不明智的假设。</p>
<p>Your task now is to bring wisdom to bear on what must be done today, and tomorrow and the days to follow. It is not a decision between love and fear. It is a decision between responsibility and irresponsibility. It is a decision between wisdom or anxiety.</p>
<p>你现在的任务是，用智慧来决定今天、明天以及未来的日子里必须做的事情。这不是爱与恐惧之间的抉择。这是责任与不责任之间的抉择。这是智慧与焦虑之间的抉择。</p>
<p>For if you do not prepare for the future, you will have anxiety. You will feel that you are missing something. You will feel uncomfortable with yourself and your circumstances because you are not yet responding to what Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence that God has given you, is indicating that you must do and that you must attend to.</p>
<p>因为如果你不为未来做准备，你就会焦虑。你会觉得你缺少了一些东西。你会对你自己和你的处境感到不舒服，因为你还没有回应内识，即上帝赋予你的更深层次的智能，它指示你必须去做、你必须去关注的事情。</p>
<p>So there is no real escape from this responsibility. For if you try to escape, you will feel anxiety, and you cannot escape this anxiety, for it is telling you that you are being irresponsible, that you are not meeting the requirements of life at this time which is you live in the moment and you prepare for the future appropriately and accordingly. If you think the future is going to be like the past, well, whatever plans and provisioning you do will be greatly inadequate.</p>
<p>因此，你无法真正逃避这个责任。因为如果你试图逃避，你就会感到焦虑，而你无法逃避这种焦虑，因为它告诉你，你是不负责任的，你没有满足当下生命的要求，也就是你活在当下，为未来做适当和相应的准备。如果你认为未来会像过去一样，那么，无论你做什么计划和准备都将是远远不够的。</p>
<p>Today so many people are resting on assumptions that the future will be like the past. It is upon this that they make their financial decisions. It is upon this that they determine what they will do and how they will use their resources and what they will commit themselves to.</p>
<p>如今，许多人都假设未来会和过去一样。他们根据这一假设做出财务决策。他们根据这一假设决定要做什么、如何使用资源以及要致力于什么。</p>
<p>But you must know that the environment is changing. Circumstances are changing, even for the wealthy nations. You must be attentive now and become as objective as you possibly can.</p>
<p>但你必须知道，环境正在发生改变。情况正在发生改变，即使是富裕国家也是如此。你现在必须保持警惕，尽可能保持客观。</p>
<p>When you begin to face this reality, there will be moments of anxiety and apprehension. You will feel perhaps inadequate and overwhelmed. This is understandable. Yet you must get beyond these initial feelings, for they are simply reactions. They reveal to you how unprepared you are even at this moment for the eventualities of life.</p>
<p>当你开始面对这个现实时，你会感到焦虑和不安。你也许会感到力不从心和不知所措。这是可以理解的。但你必须克服这些最初的感觉，因为它们只是反应。它们向你揭示了你此刻对生命中可能发生的事件是多么的毫无准备。</p>
<p>You must gain a sober approach. Roll up your sleeves and say, “Well, what must we do here?” And lay out a plan with many steps and begin to do the easy things first. Take care of those, and then take on more challenging projects.</p>
<p>你必须采取清醒的态度。卷起袖子说：“好吧，我们必须做什么？”制定一个多步骤的计划，先做简单的事情。先处理好这些事情，然后再处理更具挑战性的项目。</p>
<p>At the outset, you may be completely confounded as to what to do. But this will change as you begin to take steps to correct or change or prepare for immediate things that you can recognize that are well within your comprehension now. That will take you to the next step.</p>
<p>一开始，你可能完全不知道该做什么。但当你开始采取措施纠正、改变或准备你现在可以认识到的、你完全理解的紧急事情时，这种情况就会改变。这将带你进入下一步。</p>
<p>This is not a process where you go out and spend a weekend and buy a lot of things. This is not something where you simply make some grand assumptions and set the whole thing aside for yourself so that you can go back to your previous preoccupations.</p>
<p>这不是你出去度过一个周末并买许多东西的过程。这不是你简单地做出一些宏大的假设，然后把整个事情放在一边，以便你可以回到之前的专注点。</p>
<p>This is a process that has many steps. For you must prepare now for a future that will be unlike the past—a future that is far more unpredictable, a future that is far more changeable and a future that is far more dangerous and yet, a future that will provide some remarkable opportunities for you and will greatly assist you in developing your strengths, your competence, your skills, your awareness and your discernment.</p>
<p>这是一个包含许多步骤的过程。因为你现在必须为一个不同于过去的未来进行准备——一个更加不可预测的未来，一个更加多变的未来，一个更加危险的未来，然而，这个未来将为你提供一些非凡的机会，并将极大地帮助你发展你的实力、你的能力、你的技能、你的觉知和你的辨别力。</p>
<p>If life is too easy, these things never become cultivated, and the whole focus on the path of enlightenment becomes skewed and incorrect. People seek to have greater peace and equanimity. They want to feel better and feel better and feel better, and the reason they do not feel better is in part because they are not preparing for the future and they are experiencing anxiety and discomfort.</p>
<p>如果生命太过安逸，这些事情就永远不会得到培养，对启蒙之路的关注就会变得扭曲和不正确。人们寻求更大的和平与平静。他们希望感觉更好，感觉更好，感觉更好，而他们感觉不好的部分原因是他们没有为未来做好准备，他们正在经历焦虑和不适。</p>
<p>For if you do not follow what Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, is indicating, you will be uncomfortable, you will be apprehensive, you will be nervous because you are not following what the deeper Intelligence within you is indicating. You are not paying attention. You are giving your attention to the wrong things, or you are pursuing things for the wrong reasons. Or you are neglecting, in any case, your primary responsibilities.</p>
<p>因为如果你不遵循你内在的内识、更深层次的智能所指示的，你就会感到不舒服、忧虑、紧张，因为你没有遵循你内在更深层次的智能所指示的。你没有注意。你把注意力放在了错误的事情上，或者你出于错误的理由追求事物。或者无论如何，你都在忽视你的主要责任。</p>
<p>People think there is something wrong with them when they are feeling uncomfortable, and they try to get comfortable, so they try to run away from the very thing that is trying to communicate to them. The very advice, the very message, the realization that is trying to reach them, they want to now run away from this. They want to be comfortable. Such foolishness. And so they compound their problem. Now they are even more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>当人们感到不舒服时，他们会认为他们有问题，并试图让他们舒服起来，所以他们试图逃避那些试图向他们传达的讯息。他们现在想逃避那些试图传达给他们的建议、讯息和认知。他们想要安逸。如此愚蠢。因此，他们使问题更加严重。现在他们更加不舒服了。</p>
<p>There is no escaping your responsibilities. God has given you this greater Intelligence, the Intelligence of Knowledge, to guide and protect you. You have a fundamental responsibility to build a connection to this Knowledge, to connect your thinking mind—your personal mind, your worldly mind—with the deeper Divine Mind of Knowledge within yourself, which is trying to guide and prepare you, to take you to the right places, the right people, the right circumstances and to free you from the burden of all the things you have added on to your life which are non-essential or which are harmful for you.</p>
<p>你无法逃避责任。上帝赋予你这种更伟大的智能，即内识的智能，来指引和保护你。你有一个根本的责任，去建立与这种内识的联接，将你的思维心灵——你的个人心灵、你的世俗心灵——与你自己内在更深层次的神圣内识心灵相连接，它正试图指引和准备你，带你去正确的地方、正确的人、正确的环境，并让你摆脱你添加到你生命中的所有不必要的或对你有害的东西的负担。</p>
<p>So do not try to be comfortable. Try to be responsible. If you are really uncomfortable, there must be a reason for it. Ask yourself, “Why am I feeling so uncomfortable? Is there something I need to see, know or do?” Keep asking yourself these questions until you make a connection within your own experience.</p>
<p>所以不要试图让自己感到舒服。试着负责任。如果你真的不舒服，那一定是有原因的。问问你自己，“我为什么感觉这么不舒服？我需要看到、知道或做点什么吗？”不断地问你自己这些问题，直到你与你自身的体验联接起来。</p>
<p>The longer you are in denial, the longer you remain obsessed with non-essential things, the longer you are involving yourself in relationships with people, places and objects that are inappropriate for you or which are weakening you and taking your attention away, the more you will feel out of sync with yourself. You will feel disconnected from your own deeper experience.</p>
<p>你越是否认现实，你越是沉迷于无关紧要的事情，你越是与不适合你或削弱你、分散你注意力的人、地方和事物打交道，你就会越感觉到与你自己的不同步。你会感到与你自身更深层次的体验脱节。</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the condition of most people in the world today. They are uncomfortable. If they are not in terrible circumstances already, they are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>事实上，这就是当今世界上大多数人的现状。他们感到不舒服。即使他们现在的处境还不算糟糕，他们也感到不舒服。</p>
<p>Even the wealthiest people—very uncomfortable. Now they want to buy more things, have more stimulating experiences, go see more movies and have more exciting adventures or more romance. They are simply delaying the recognition that there are things they need to see and know and do that they are neglecting. If this persists, it becomes very chronic and very disabling.</p>
<p>即使是最富有的人也感到非常不舒服。现在他们想买更多的东西，拥有更多刺激的体验，看更多电影，体验更多激动人心的冒险或更多浪漫。他们只是在推迟认识到他们所需要看到、知道和做的事情，而他们却忽略了这些事情。如果这种情况持续下去，就会变得非常慢性，非常令人无能为力。</p>
<p>Your first responsibility in life is to build a connection to Knowledge, to take the Steps to Knowledge, for this is how God is going to help you. You can pray to God for many things. You can pray for success. You can pray for health. You can pray to avoid disaster. You can pray for your friends and your family and loved ones. But if you want to allow God to guide you, you must build a bridge from your worldly mind where you live to the deeper Mind of Knowledge within yourself. For it is Knowledge and only Knowledge that can guide and protect you in the difficult and uncertain times ahead.</p>
<p>你生命中的首要责任是建立与内识的联接，开展内识的进阶，因为这是上帝帮助你的方式。你可以为许多事情向上帝祈祷。你可以祈求成功。你可以祈求健康。你可以祈求避免灾难。你可以为你的朋友、家人和所爱之人祈祷。但如果你想让上帝指引你，你必须在你生活的世俗心灵和你自己内在的更深层次的内识心灵之间建立一座桥梁。因为是内识，也只有内识，才能在未来的艰难和不确定时期指引和保护你。</p>
<p>Fervently believing in God, fervently believing in the teachings of the savior or the prophet or the enlightened one will not prepare you for the future and will not provide you the wisdom of what you must see, know and do now to live your life responsibly.</p>
<p>狂热地相信上帝、狂热地相信救世主、先知或启蒙者的教导，并不能让你为未来做好准备，也不能为你提供现在必须看到、知道和做的事情的智慧，让你能够负责任地过好你的生命。</p>
<p>These fervent beliefs will not bring you closer to God unless you can build a bridge to Knowledge, for it is through Knowledge that God’s Will can speak to you in your circumstances. It will not be God speaking like a person speaking to you. It will be the thoughts, the images, the urges, the restraint, the encouragement—all coming from a deeper, more mysterious Intelligence somewhere within you, somewhere beyond the grasp and control of your intellect, your ideas and your beliefs.</p>
<p>这些狂热的信仰不会让你更接近上帝，除非你能搭建起一座通向内识的桥梁，因为正是通过内识，上帝的意志才能在你的境遇中对你说话。上帝不会像人一样对你说话。思想、形象、冲动、克制、鼓励——所有这些都来自你内心深处、更神秘的智能，超出了你的智力、你的想法和你的信仰的掌握和控制。</p>
<p>If you want to be close to God, you must build a connection to the wisdom that God has placed within you. If you want to allow God to assist you, you must build a connection to Knowledge and take the Steps to Knowledge and build this foundation in Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果你想接近上帝，你必须建立与上帝放置在你内在的智慧的一种联接。如果你想让上帝帮助你，你必须建立与内识的联接，并开展内识进阶，并在内识中构建这个基础。</p>
<p>For only Knowledge knows what is coming. Only Knowledge can tell you what to do at the difficult moments of decision. Only Knowledge will take you to the right people, the right places and the right situations and circumstances. Only Knowledge will pull you out of disaster and prevent you from leading yourself to disaster.</p>
<p>因为只有内识知道会发生什么。只有内识能告诉你在艰难的决策时刻该做什么。只有内识能带你找到正确的人、正确的地点、正确的情况和环境。只有内识能把你从灾难中拉出来，防止你把你自己引向灾难。</p>
<p>God does not need your belief. God does not need your worship. God does not need to be celebrated. God needs to be followed.</p>
<p>上帝不需要你的信仰。上帝不需要你的崇拜。上帝不需要被庆祝。上帝需要被追随。</p>
<p>You follow God most profoundly, most purely, not by believing in the edicts of religion necessarily, but by building a connection to Knowledge. If religion is functioning correctly, it is helping you to build a bridge to Knowledge, to your own conscience and to live responsibly, ethically and beneficially, both for yourself and for others.</p>
<p>你最深刻、最纯粹地追随上帝，并非一定要相信宗教的教规，而是通过建立与内识的联接。如果宗教运作得当，它就会帮助你架起一座通向内识、通向你自身良知的桥梁，并负责任、合乎道德、有益地生活，既为你自己也为他人。</p>
<p>When religion does not do this, it is not serving its primary purpose, the purpose that was established by God. But in so many cases, religious leaders and institutions have lost this fundamental understanding, and now they use religion for other purposes—for political purposes, for economic purposes, to corral people and to direct their thoughts and behaviors for the interests of the state or the interests of a church or the mosque or the temple. This is not religion’s real role and task. It is an aberration. It is a misuse. And in many cases, it is an abomination.</p>
<p>如果宗教做不到这一点，它就无法实现其主要目的，即上帝所制定的目的。但在很多情况下，宗教领袖和宗教机构已经失去了这种基本理解，现在他们把宗教用于其他目的——政治目的、经济目的、控制人民并引导他们的思想和行为以符合国家利益或教堂、清真寺或寺庙的利益。这不是宗教的真正作用和任务。它是一种反常行为。它是一种错误使用。在许多情况下，它是一种令人憎恶的行为。</p>
<p>At this moment you do not know what to do completely to prepare for the future because you do not know what kind of future you are preparing for. And even if you could find that out and have greater clarity here to know what is coming over the horizon of your life, you do not know all the steps that you will have to take to prepare for this.</p>
<p>此刻你还不知道要做什么才能为未来做好充分准备，因为你不知道你在为什么样的未来做准备。即使你能找到答案，并在此更清晰地知道你生命中即将发生的事情，你也不知道为此需要采取哪些步骤。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are going to have to learn to be attentive and patient and responsive. There are things you must do today and tomorrow and in the days to come. Right now you cannot see all of it. But these things will reveal themselves to you if you can proceed accordingly, building your connection to Knowledge and preparing your life for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world.</p>
<p>因此，你将必须学会细心、耐心和反应灵敏。有些事情你必须在今天、明天和未来的日子里去做。现在你无法看到所有的事情。但如果你能继续前行，建立你与内识的联接，并为即将降临世界的变革巨浪做好准备，这些事情就会展现在你面前。</p>
<p>For humanity has two great challenges. It has to face the results of centuries of environmental decay and destruction, the results of its own misuse of the world, the results of its lack of wisdom in the past. The results of so many of these things will be coming due. It will be a great threat to the well-being of people everywhere, even in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>因为人类面临两大挑战。它必须面对数个世纪以来环境恶化和破坏的后果、它自身对世界的滥用的后果、它过去缺乏智慧的后果。这些事情的后果将很快到来。它将对世界各地人民的福祉构成巨大威胁，即使是在富裕国家。</p>
<p>The second great challenge is humanity’s contact with intelligent life from the universe, from the Greater Community of life in which you live. A dangerous Intervention is already occurring in the world and has been underway for several decades.</p>
<p>第二大挑战是人类与来自宇宙的智能生命、来自你们所生活的生命大社区的接触。一场危险的干预已经在世界上发生，而且已经持续了几十年。</p>
<p>Together these represent the greatest challenge to humanity’s well-being, freedom and sovereignty in this world than has ever occurred before. An unprecedented set of circumstances, when taken together, can seem truly overwhelming and daunting, overwhelming and daunting to your mind and intellect, but not to Knowledge.</p>
<p>这些因素加在一起，代表着人类福祉、自由和主权面临前所未有的最大挑战。当这些前所未有的情况结合在一起时，它们可能看起来真的势不可挡、令人生畏，对你的心灵和智力而言是势不可挡、令人生畏的，但对内识而言并非如此。</p>
<p>For you have come into the world to meet these challenges. You have come into the world to serve the world and to assist humanity and all life here according to the specific role you are meant to take and the specific people that you must find and build a true connection with.</p>
<p>因为你来到这个世界就是为了应对这些挑战。你来到这个世界就是为了服务世界、帮助人类和这里的所有生命，根据你注定要承担的特定角色以及你必须找到并与之建立一种真实联接的特定人。</p>
<p>It takes a Greater Plan here, not a plan that you make, not a plan that you invent, not a plan that you read about in the newspaper or the magazine.</p>
<p>这里需要一个更伟大的计划，而不是你制定的计划，不是你发明的计划，也不是你在报纸或杂志上读到的计划。</p>
<p>At any given moment in following Knowledge, certain questions will be answered and certain questions will not be answered. If you are to take such a journey to gain such wisdom, to learn of a Greater Plan of which you are a part, you must have an openness of mind. You must avoid making premature conclusions and living on assumptions. You must have the courage to face the uncertainties of life and the great uncertainties that the future will create for you and for everyone.</p>
<p>在跟随内识的任何时刻，某些问题会得到解答，而某些问题则不会得到解答。如果你要踏上这样的旅程，获得这样的智慧，了解你作为其中一部分的一个更伟大计划，你必须拥有一种开放的心灵。你必须避免过早得出结论或生活在假设中。你必须有勇气面对生命的不确定性以及未来将为你和每个人创造的巨大不确定性。</p>
<p>Here you must accept that the things that you believe will provide for you and take care of you may not be there for you in the future, or for your children and your loved ones.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须接受这样一个事实，即你认为可以供养你、照顾你的事情，在未来也许不会再为你、你的孩子和你所爱的人提供。</p>
<p>The supermarkets may not be full of food. The government may not be able to help. There may not be medical care available to you at all times and all circumstances. You may not have a job. There may not be a job. The environment will be changing.</p>
<p>超市里可能没有足够的食物。政府可能无法提供帮助。你可能无法在任何时候、任何情况下获得医疗服务。你可能没有工作，也许根本就没有工作。环境将会发生变化。</p>
<p>How people respond to this remains to be seen, but certainly there will be social disorder. Certainly, there will be great political and economic instability. Certainly, many people will not respond wisely or appropriately to these circumstances.</p>
<p>人们对此将作何反应还有待观察，但社会肯定会陷入混乱。当然，政治和经济将极不稳定。当然，许多人不会对这些情况作出明智或适当的反应。</p>
<p>Many people’s circumstances, their personal circumstances, will change dramatically, even very suddenly. It will be great travail for them, for they are unprepared. They did not see what was coming and they did not prepare.</p>
<p>许多人的境况，他们的个人境况，将会发生巨大改变，甚至是非常突然的。对他们来说，这将是巨大的痛苦，因为他们没有做好准备。他们没有预见到即将发生的事情，也没有做好准备。</p>
<p>You will see this all around you, and it will be very disheartening and, in many cases, very tragic. That is why preparing for the future is of such great importance for you because you must be in a position, not only to navigate the difficult times ahead, but also to support and assist others who will be facing great difficulties.</p>
<p>你将会看到这种情况在你周围随处可见，它将令人沮丧，在许多情况下，甚至非常悲惨。这就是为什么为未来做准备对你如此重要，因为你必须能够不仅渡过未来的艰难时期，而且还能够支持和帮助那些面临巨大困难的人。</p>
<p>Therefore, do not be dismayed that you perhaps are the only one you know who is taking these preparations, who is looking into the future, who is seeing what the New Message from God is revealing about what is coming for humanity. You may be the only one who is looking and reading and studying the signs of the world, the signs of nature, the cues and messages that you are receiving, that you must receive and recognize and face.</p>
<p>因此，不要沮丧，也许你是唯一一个在做这些准备的人，唯一一个在展望未来的人，唯一一个在看到上帝新讯息所揭示的人类未来。也许你是唯一一个在观察、阅读和研究世界迹象、自然迹象、正在接收的提示和讯息的人，你必须接收、认识和面对这些。</p>
<p>Many people will not look. They will not prepare. They will live on their assumptions. They do not want to be troubled. They do not want to put in the extra effort. They do not want to deal with anxiety and uncertainty. They do not want to have to make difficult decisions or give up things that they think they want or need for themselves.</p>
<p>许多人不会去观察。他们不会去准备。他们只会活在他们的假设中。他们不想被困扰。他们不想付出额外的努力。他们不想应对焦虑和不确定性。他们不想做出艰难的决定或放弃他们认为他们自己想要或需要的东西。</p>
<p>Right now you cannot help them. You must build your own foundation, a foundation in Knowledge and a foundation in the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Health, the Pillar of Work and the Pillar of Spiritual Development.</p>
<p>现在你无法帮助他们。你必须建立你自身的基础，一个内识的基础和一个你生命四大支柱的基础——关系支柱、健康支柱、工作支柱和精神发展支柱。</p>
<p>You must build your own life raft if you are to be in a position to assist others. You do not want to be a victim of the future. You want to be a beneficiary of the future and a contributor in the future. That means you have to prepare now, for the hour is late, and the Great Waves of change are coming.</p>
<p>如果你想要帮助他人，你必须建立你自身的救生筏。你不想成为未来的受害者。你想成为未来的受益者和未来的贡献者。这意味着你必须现在就做好准备，因为时间已经不多了，变革的巨浪即将到来。</p>
<p>Already, you can feel the impacts. Already, if you look around the world objectively, without insisting on your beliefs or ideology, if you look objectively, you can begin to see the evidence that great change is just beginning.</p>
<p>你已经可以感受到影响。如果你客观地环顾世界，不坚持你的信仰或意识形态，如果你客观地看待世界，你就可以开始看到伟大的变革刚刚开始的证据。</p>
<p>This will perhaps be disconcerting to your mind, but to your heart it will be a confirmation, for this is why you have come. You did not come all the way into this world to give up your Ancient Home and your Spiritual Family to enter here to simply acquire pleasantries for yourself, simply to enjoy life’s sweets and life’s many little pleasures. You came for a greater purpose. And in your heart you know this to be true.</p>
<p>这也许会让你感到不安，但对你的内心来说，它将是一种确认，因为这就是你来的原因。你千里迢迢来到这个世界，并不是为了放弃你的古老家园和你的精神家庭，来到这里仅仅是为了获得你自己的快乐，只是为了享受生命的甜蜜和生命中的许多小乐趣。你是为了一个更伟大的目的而来的。你在心里知道这是真的。</p>
<p>You do not want to allow yourself to become decadent and corrupted by these pleasures, even the ones that seem very simple and harmless. They are fine in their place, but they cannot be the focus of your life. If they are, it means you do not know your life. You are not connected to Knowledge. You do not know your own heart. You are not properly engaged in the world at this time.</p>
<p>你不想让你自己因为这些享乐而变得颓废和堕落，即使那些看起来非常简单和无害的享乐。它们在它们的位置上很好，但它们不能成为你生命的焦点。如果它们是，它意味着你不知道你的生命。你没有和内识联接。你不知道你自己的内心。你此时没有适当地参与世界。</p>
<p>So you must find the courage within yourself to face the Great Waves of change and to keep looking to allow your understanding to grow and to become more complete. You must begin to take the steps that you will have to take to fortify your life, to alter your life, to reinforce your life, to redirect your life and to prepare for what you will see is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>因此你必须找到你内在的勇气去面对变革的巨浪，并继续寻求让你的理解成长并变得更加完整。你必须开始采取你必须采取的步骤来巩固你的生命，改变你的生命，强化你的生命，重新引导你的生命，并为你将看到的即将到来之事做好准备。</p>
<p>Here you cannot simply pack up a lot of food and go hide somewhere. That will not work. You cannot simply move to the country and think you will be safe, for you will not be safe there. The Great Waves are too great.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能简单地打包很多食物，然后躲到某个地方。这是行不通的。你不能简单地搬到乡下，认为这样就安全了，因为在乡下你不会安全。变革的巨浪将是如此巨大。</p>
<p>There is no place to hide. All the reassurances you give yourself will be inadequate to deal with the circumstances that are coming to you. You are going to have to become more sober and more serious about this matter, more careful and more patient.</p>
<p>无处可藏。你给你自己的所有保证都不足以应对即将发生的情况。你必须对此事更加清醒、更加认真、更加谨慎、更加耐心。</p>
<p>As We have said, you do not know all the things you will have to do, but you must begin the process—begin to take the Steps to Knowledge. Begin to assess every activity you have in your life and ask yourself: “Is this activity appropriate for me and will I be able to maintain it in the near future?”</p>
<p>正如我们所说，你并不知道你必须要做的所有事情，但你必须开始这个过程——开始开展内识的进阶。开始评估你生命中的每一项活动，并问你自己：“这项活动适合我吗？我能否在不久的将来继续做下去？”</p>
<p>Go around your house and ask yourself about every possession that you have: “Does this possession really serve me? Will it serve me in the future?” Begin to sort out, for you cannot be given a new realization if your life is full of relationships with people, places and things that are not right for you, or that will not help you.</p>
<p>在家里走一圈，问问你自己拥有的每一件物品：“这些物品真的对我有用吗？它们将来会对我有用吗？”开始理清思绪吧，因为如果你的生命充满了与不适合你或对你没有帮助的人、地方和事物的关系，你就不可能得到新的认识。</p>
<p>Every relationship you have should give you the strength to do this. Every possession you have should either be useful or inspiring to you. Every commitment and obligation must help you to prepare and to gain a foundation in Knowledge.</p>
<p>你所拥有的每一种关系都应该给你力量去做到这一点。你所拥有的每一件物品都应该对你有用或有启发。每一项承诺和义务都必须帮助你做好准备并获得内识的基础。</p>
<p>For there are no neutral relationships in life. All your relationships with people, with where you live, with your possessions, with your activities, are either strengthening you or weakening you in taking the Steps to Knowledge and in building a real foundation for your life.</p>
<p>因为生命中不存在中立的关系。你与他人、与居住地、与财产、与活动的所有关系要么在强化你，要么在削弱你开展内识进阶和构建生命真正基础的能力。</p>
<p>Here you must learn to become inner directed rather than outer directed. Here you will find out as you proceed that even the experts really do not know what they are doing—those people who seem so self-assured, who have such strong views or vaulted opinions—they are only living on assumptions. These assumptions are very doubtful.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须学会由内而外地引导自己。在这里，随着你的不断前行，你会发现，即使是专家也不知道他们在做什么——那些看起来如此自信、有如此强烈的观点或见解的人——他们只是生活在假设中。这些假设非常值得怀疑。</p>
<p>Here you will see that you cannot simply follow someone, believing that they know the way. You can only follow someone who is strong with Knowledge, but if you are not strong with Knowledge yourself, how will you know who they are? How will you know how to be with them? They will not lead you around as if you were a little puppy, a little pet.</p>
<p>在这里，你将看到，你不能简单地跟随某人，相信他们知道路。你只能跟随那些拥有强大内识的人，但如果你自己的内识不强大，你怎么知道他们是谁？你怎么知道如何与他们相处？他们不会把你当成一只小狗、一只小宠物一样牵着走。</p>
<p>You yourself must become strong, stronger than you are today—not fearful, not full of trepidation, but clear, objective, open and observant. All the energy you spend today condemning people and governments—all that energy now has to be saved to prepare you for the future. All the time you waste on your hobbies and your meaningless conversations with people—all that energy is going to be needed for you now. You cannot be wasting it in all directions.</p>
<p>你，你自己必须变得强大，比现在的你更强大——不要害怕，不要充满恐惧，而是清晰、客观、开放和善于观察。你今天花在谴责他人和政府上的所有能量——现在必须把这些能量保留起来，为未来做准备。你浪费在爱好和与他人无意义的对话上的所有时间——现在你需要所有这些能量。你不能把能量浪费在所有方面。</p>
<p>Every day is important. Every month is important. Every year is very important. You have your wonderful times and your pleasant moments, and as you proceed, you have less and less anxiety because your life is becoming [more] in keeping with Knowledge within yourself. You actually feel freer and more confident, whereas before your life was governed by fear and avoidance.</p>
<p>每一天都很重要。每个月都很重要。每一年都非常重要。你有美好的时光和愉快的时刻，随着你的前进，你的焦虑会越来越少，因为你的生命越来越符合你内在的内识。你实际上感觉更自由、更自信，而之前你的生命被恐惧和逃避所支配。</p>
<p>When you are moving with life, you gain a greater confidence in life and a greater confidence in yourself that you will know what to see and do. But you must be moving with life. You must be building and learning to use your time and your vital energy meaningfully and appropriately.</p>
<p>当你与生命一起前行时，你会对生命和你自己产生更大的信心，知道你该看什么、该做什么。但你必须与生命一起前行。你必须建立并学会有意义地、恰当地使用你的时间和你的生命力。</p>
<p>You cannot sit on the side of the road and have someone else build for you a foundation for the future. Many people will try that, of course, but that will not lead to success, and for many people it will be disastrous.</p>
<p>你不能坐在路边等着有人为你打下未来的基础。当然，许多人会尝试这样做，但这样做不会成功，对许多人来说，这将是灾难性的。</p>
<p>You must learn to be open. You cannot control this process, but you must control your thoughts and your mind and your actions. That is where your self-control really will make the difference. You must learn to be able to restrain yourself and hold yourself back from giving your life away in premature relationships or in outrage against the world or in following people who really do not know where they are going or what they are doing.</p>
<p>你必须学会​​开放。你无法控制这个过程，但你必须控制你的思想、你的心灵和你的行为。这就是你的自我控制真正发挥作用的地方。你必须学会​​克制你自己，不要把你的生命献给不成熟的关系，不要对世界感到愤怒，不要追随那些真的不知道他们要去哪里或做什么的人。</p>
<p>Do not assume that others know. You must know. Not all the facts. Not everything about the future. But you must sense what is coming, and you must realize what you have to do to respond to that, what is within your power to do each day. Then, and only then, will you begin to feel that Knowledge is a presence and a power in your life, and not simply some remote possibility.</p>
<p>不要认为他人知道。你必须知道。不是所有的事实。不是关于未来的一切。但你必须感知即将发生的事情，你必须意识到你必须做什么来应对它，你必须意识到你每天有能力做什么。只有到那时，你才会开始感觉到内识是你生命中的一种存在和力量，而不仅仅是某种遥不可及的可能性。</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to get people moving. If people are asleep by the side of the road, or they are standing around not knowing what to do, you have to get them moving. You have to get them involved.</p>
<p>在这里，必须让人们行动起来。如果人们在路边睡觉，或者站在那里不知道该做什么，你就必须让他们行动起来。你必须让他们参与进来。</p>
<p>We are talking about you. Your life has to become uniform and strong. You have to see where you are losing energy to people, to situations, to obligations, to activities, to jobs that are really not right for you. It will take a lot of strength and a lot of effort to make the necessary adjustments to your life.</p>
<p>我们谈论的是你。你的生命必须变得统一而强大。你必须看到你在哪些方面浪费了能量，浪费在那些不适合你的人、情况、义务、活动和工作上。你需要付出很大的力量和努力才能对你的生命做出必要的调整。</p>
<p>You must have this strength and this energy. In gaining this, you will see how you are wasting your strength and your energy, how you are giving away your life to others, how you follow needlessly and heedlessly what other people want you to do or tell you you must do. That will not help you now. In fact, it never helped you at all.</p>
<p>你必须拥有这种力量和能量。获得这种力量和能量后，你就会看到你是如何浪费你的力量和你的能量，如何将你的生命拱手让给他人，如何毫无必要地、不顾一切地听从他人的命令或指示。现在这样做对你没有帮助。事实上，这样做根本没有帮助。</p>
<p>You will need to learn to live using much less energy. You need to live near where you work. You will need to be able to get around without the automobile to a far greater degree than at present.</p>
<p>你需要学会使用更少的能源生活。你需要住在工作地点附近。你需要能够比现在更多地不使用汽车出行。</p>
<p>You must be employed in work that has a future in a declining world, providing fundamental services to people—goods and services that people will always need, not simply what they can afford with their spare time or their spare money.</p>
<p>你必须从事一份在这个衰退的世界中仍有前途的工作，为人们提供基本服务——人们永远需要的商品和服务，而不仅仅是他们用业余时间或闲钱就能买得起的东西。</p>
<p>You must build some real skills. You will probably need to learn how to grow at least part of your own food and learn some basic skills that have been lost in your modern cultures.</p>
<p>你必须培养一些真正的技能。你可能需要学习如何种植至少一部分你自身的食物，并学习一些在现代文化中已经丧失的基本技能。</p>
<p>Your life will have to become much simpler than it is today, much more efficient than it is today. You will have to learn how to use your time and your financial resources much more carefully, and to find pleasure and joy in simpler things.</p>
<p>你的生命必须比现在简单得多，效率要高得多。你必须学会​​如何更加谨慎地利用你的时间和财务资源，并在简单的事情中找到快乐和喜悦。</p>
<p>You will need to own far less, for you will not have room for things in the future. You will need to have some savings. You will need to have financial resources available to you. And you will need to have such strength that you can assist others who have genuine needs, the very young and the very old in particular.</p>
<p>你需要拥有更少的东西，因为未来你将没有空间放置东西。你需要有一些积蓄。你需要有可用的财务资源。你需要有这样的力量，能够帮助真正需要帮助的人，尤其是非常年幼和年长的人。</p>
<p>This is what will redeem you to a true life, to an authentic life, not a life of obsessions and addictions, a life of personal avoidance and irresponsibility, but a real life with real relationships, meaningful work and deep, simple pleasures.</p>
<p>这将使你过上真实的生命，一种真正的生命，不是一种痴迷和上瘾的生命，不是一种逃避和不负责任的生命，而是有真正的关系、有意义的工作、有深度又简单的快乐的生命。</p>
<p>Humanity has used up much of its endowment in the world. Now it must face the consequences. It is also facing competition from the Greater Community in the form of Intervention from groups who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity for their own purposes. You must learn about these things, as bravely and as objectively as you can.</p>
<p>人类已经耗尽了它在这个世界上的大部分馈赠。现在，它必须面对后果。它还面临着来自大社区的竞争，这些竞争的形式是来自一些团体的干预，这些团体在这里是为了他们自身的目的而利用软弱和分裂的人类。你必须尽可能勇敢、客观地了解这些事情。</p>
<p>Regarding the Greater Community, only God’s New Revelation can show that to you, for humanity is ignorant and vulnerable in the Greater Community. You will need a New Revelation to understand what you are facing and what is occurring here now. Such an understanding you cannot find in your textbooks, your colleges, your universities or your popular magazines. Even in esoteric writings, the truth of this is not clearly revealed.</p>
<p>关于大社区，只有上帝的新启示才能向你展示这一点，因为人类在大社区中是无知和脆弱的。你将需要一个新的启示来理解你所面对的以及现在这里正在发生的事情。你在教科书、学院、大学或流行杂志中找不到这样的理解。即使在秘传著作中，这个真理也没有被清楚地揭示。</p>
<p>This may seem overwhelming at first, but it is what will save you from an insipid and mundane life. It is what will free you from bondage and obligation to others that can only weaken you and waste your time and your energy.</p>
<p>起初，这可能会让你感到不知所措，但正是它能将你从枯燥乏味的生命中拯救出来。正是它能将你从束缚和对他人的义务中解放出来，而这些束缚和义务只会削弱你，浪费你的时间和能量。</p>
<p>Allow the challenges of life to clarify your life, to unify your life and to strengthen your life. Do not worry about what will have to be given up. Things fall away along the way.</p>
<p>让生命的挑战来澄清你的生命，统一你的生命，强化你的生命。不要担心必须放弃什么。一切都会随之而去。</p>
<p>Already there are things you are doing that you are ambivalent about because they are not really meaningful. You are only involved to please some expectation of yourself or someone else’s expectation of you. Preparing for the future will free you from the ravages of the past and from the dissolution of your life.</p>
<p>你已经对正在做的事情感到矛盾，因为它们实际上没有意义。你参与其中只是为了满足你自己或他人对你的期望。为未来做好准备，将使你摆脱过去的摧残，摆脱生命的解体。</p>
<p>You want God to save you? You want God to redeem you? You want God to give you strength, purpose, meaning and integrity? Then this is it.</p>
<p>你想让上帝拯救你？你想让上帝救赎你？你想让上帝赋予你力量、目的、意义和完整性？那么，它就是内识。</p>
<p>Knowledge will carry you forth, and anything that is not of Knowledge will fall away or become far less important to you as you proceed. This is how your life is brought back to its Source. This is how your activities are given clarity, uniformity and direction.</p>
<p>内识将引领你前进，随着你的前进，任何不属于内识的事情都将消失或对你变得不那么重要。这就是你的生命回归本源的方式。这就是你的活动获得清晰、统一和方向的方式。</p>
<p>You must face the future or it will overtake you and destroy your life. Do not think that because you live in a certain country or you believe in a certain political system or you adhere to a certain religion that you will be exempt from this. There are no exemptions.</p>
<p>你必须面对未来，否则未来就会降临到你头上，毁掉你的生命。不要认为你生活在某个国家，信仰某种政治制度，或者信奉某种宗教，你就可以免受未来的影响。没有例外。</p>
<p>Before coming into this world, you knew you were entering a time of great change and difficulty. You came with this understanding. That understanding is still within you, kept for you by Knowledge, the great endowment God has given you—this deeper Mind. It has the memory of your Ancient Home and the memory of those who sent you into the world.</p>
<p>在来到这个世界之前，你就知道你将进入一个充满伟大变革和困难的时期。你带着这种理解而来。这种理解仍然在你的内心，由内识为你保管，内识是上帝赋予你的伟大馈赠——这个更深层次的心灵。它拥有你古老家园的记忆，以及那些把你送到这个世界的不可见者的记忆。</p>
<p>But your intellect cannot find this memory. Your worldly mind cannot grasp it and claim it. It will reveal itself as you proceed, as you take the Steps to Knowledge within yourself and as you begin to focus your life on the outside.</p>
<p>但你的智力无法找到这个记忆。你的世俗心灵无法掌握它并占有它。当你继续前进，当你在你自己的内在开展内识的进阶，当你开始将生命重点放在外部时，它将显露出来。</p>
<p>God’s New Message has been given to alert you and to prepare you and to bless you. It is here to alert you to the realities of life both now and in the future—realities that most people cannot see or will not see. It is here to prepare you by teaching you what spirituality means at the level of Knowledge, a Teaching that has never been given to all of humanity before. And it is here to bless you, to give you the strength, the protection and the guidance that only Knowledge can provide.</p>
<p>上帝的新讯息被赋予，是为了警示你们、准备你们并祝福你们。它在此警示你现在和未来生命的现实——大多数人看不到或不愿看到的现实。它在这里通过教导你内识层面上的精神性意义来准备你，这是一项从未被赋予全人类的教导。它在这里祝福你，给予你只有内识才能提供的力量、保护和指导。</p>
<p>For Knowledge is of God. It is not a human invention. It is not something that was made up by some institution or a group of people. It is the foundation of your life. It is your guiding light.</p>
<p>因为内识就是上帝的。它不是人类的发明。它不是某个机构或某个群体编造出来的事物。它是你生命的基础。它是你的指路明灯。</p>
<p>It is Knowledge that will give you the courage and the commitment to follow what you most deeply know and to do what you see that you must do. This is God’s blessing for you. It has always been with you. And now you need it as never before.</p>
<p>正是内识赋予你勇气和决心，让你追随你最深刻的知道，做你认为必须做的事。这是上帝对你的祝福。它一直伴随着你。而现在你比以往任何时候都更需要它。</p>
